0.418307523,27556480,From Cells to Virus Particles: Quantitative Methods to Monitor RNA Packaging,"In cells, positive strand RNA viruses, such as Retroviridae , must selectively recognize their full-length RNA genome among abundant cellular RNAs to assemble and release particles. How viruses coordinate the intracellular trafficking of both RNA and protein components to the assembly sites of infectious particles at the cell surface remains a long-standing question. The mechanisms ensuring packaging of genomic RNA are essential for viral infectivity. Since RNA packaging impacts on several essential functions of retroviral replication such as RNA dimerization, translation and recombination events, there are many studies that require the determination of RNA packaging efficiency and/or RNA packaging ability. Studies of RNA encapsidation rely upon techniques for the identification and quantification of RNA species packaged by the virus. This review focuses on the different approaches available to monitor RNA packaging: Northern blot analysis, ribonuclease protection assay and quantitative reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction as well as the most recent RNA imaging and sequencing technologies. Advantages, disadvantages and limitations of these approaches will be discussed in order to help the investigator to choose the most appropriate technique. Although the review was written with the prototypic simple murine leukemia virus (MLV) and complex human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in mind, the techniques were described in order to benefit to a larger community.",Viruses,IMMUN
0.288658314,28356679,Identification and analysis of insulin like peptides in nematode secretomes provide targets for parasite control,"Insulin-like (ins) peptides play an important role in development and metabolism across the metazoa. In nematodes, these are also required for dauer formation and longevity and are expressed in different types of neurons across various life stages which demonstrate their role in parasites and could become possible targets for parasite control. To date, many nematode genomes are publically available. However, a systematic screening of ins peptides across different nematode group has not been reported. In the present study, we systematically identified ins peptides in the secretomes of 73 nematodes with fully sequenced genomes covering five different groups viz. plant parasitic, animal parasitic, human parasitic, entomopathogenic and free living nematodes. From the total of 93,949 secretory proteins, 176 proteins were uniquely mapped to 40 identified C. elegans ins families. The obtained result showed that 74.15% of the identified ins proteins were represented in free living nematodes only and remaining 25.84% were combinedly identified in all other nematode groups. The ins-1, ins-17 and ins-18 were the only ins families which were detected in all the studied nematode groups. Out of 176 proteins, 96 of ins proteins were predicted as hydrophilic in nature and 39 proteins were found stable using ProtParam analysis. Our study provides insight into the distribution of ins peptides across different group of nematodes and this information could be useful for further experimental study.",Bioinformation,CS
0.464971276,24999802,The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Pseudogene Expression Reveals Biologically and Clinically Relevant Tumour Subtypes," Although individual pseudogenes have been implicated in tumor biology, the biomedical significance and clinical relevance of pseudogene expression have not been assessed in a systematic way. Here we generate pseudogene expression profiles in 2,808 patient samples of seven cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA-seq data using a newly developed computational pipeline. Supervised analysis reveals a significant number of pseudogenes differentially expressed among established tumor subtypes; and pseudogene expression alone can accurately classify the major histological subtypes of endometrial cancer. Across cancer types, the tumor subtypes revealed by pseudogene expression show extensive and strong concordance with the subtypes defined by other molecular data. Strikingly, in kidney cancer, the pseudogene-expression subtypes not only significantly correlate with patient survival, but also help stratify patients in combination with clinical variables. Our study highlights the potential of pseudogene expression analysis as a new paradigm for investigating cancer mechanisms and discovering prognostic biomarkers. ",Nature communications,ONCO
0.987055055,22015046,Cell invasion and strain dependent induction of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling-1 by  Toxoplasma gondii," Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that has to cope with the microbicidal actions of IFNŒ≥. Previously we reported that parasite-mediated induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1) contributes to inhibition of IFNŒ≥ signaling. However, the signaling requirements remained elusive. We now show that induction of SOCS1 and inhibition of nitric oxide production by IFNŒ≥ was independent of stimulation of Toll-like receptors. Instead, infection by T. gondii resulted in induction of egr transcription factors which have been reported to regulate SOCS expression. Indeed, induction of egr2 as well as SOCS1 was dependent on p38 MAP kinase and blockade of egr inhibited SOCS1 expression. Moreover, we found that Mic8, a previously identified invasion factor of T. gondii , was necessary for SOCS1 regulation and escape of IFNŒ≥ mediated nitric oxide secretion within macrophages. Surprisingly, when further analyzing Mic8 deficient parasites we noted that inhibition of IFNŒ≥ mediated up-regulation of MHC-class II and ICAM1 molecules was independent of cell invasion. Furthermore, these inhibitory effects were equally observed in type I and II strains of T. gondii and were dependent on excreted and secreted antigens. In contrast, only the virulent RH type I strain additionally induced SOCS1 and efficiently inhibited nitric oxide secretion by IFNŒ≥. The results show that T. gondii makes use of two different mechanisms to escape from IFNŒ≥ activity with one mode being strain dependent and relying on active cell invasion and SOCS1 induction.

0.929292947,22947061,Superresolution microscopy for microbiology," Summary  This review provides a practical introduction to superresolution microscopy from the perspective of microbiological research. Because of the small sizes of bacterial cells, superresolution methods are particularly powerful and suitable for revealing details of cellular structures that are not resolvable under conventional fluorescence light microscopy. Here we describe the methodological concepts behind three major categories of super-resolution light microscopy: photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and stimulated emission-depletion (STED) microscopy. We then present recent applications of each of these techniques to microbial systems, which have revealed novel conformations of cellular structures and described new properties of in vivo protein function and interactions. Finally, we discuss the unique issues related to implementing each of these superresolution techniques with bacterial specimens and suggest avenues for future development. The goal of this review is to provide the necessary technical background for interested microbiologists to choose the appropriate super-resolution method for their biological systems, and to introduce the practical considerations required for designing and analysing superresolution imaging experiments.

0.776652222,24047875,Use of kernel-based Bayesian models to predict late osteolysis after hip replacement,"We studied the relationship between osteolysis and polyethylene wear, age at surgery, body mass index and height in 463 subjects (180 osteolysis and 283 controls) after cemented Charnley total hip arthroplasty (THA), in order to develop a kernel-based Bayesian model to quantitate risk of osteolysis. Such tools may be integrated into decision-making algorithms to help personalize clinical decision-making. A predictive model was constructed, and the estimated posterior probability of the implant failure calculated. Annual wear provided the greatest discriminatory information. Age at surgery provided additional predictive information and was added to the model. Body mass index and height did not contain valuable discriminatory information over the range in which observations were densely sampled. The robustness and misclassification rate of the predictive model was evaluated by a five-times cross-validation method. This yielded a 70% correct predictive classification of subjects into osteolysis versus non-osteolysis groups at a mean of 11 years after THA. Finally, the data were divided into male and female subsets to further explore the relationship between wear rate, age at surgery and incidence of osteolysis. The correct classification rate using age and wear rate in the model was approximately 66% for males and 74% for females.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",CS
0.464632727,25158932,The recording of adverse events from psychological treatments in clinical trials: evidence from a review of NIHR-funded trials,"Background There is a concern in the literature that harm from interventions is insufficiently documented in clinical trials in general, and in those assessing psychological treatments in particular. A recent decision by a trial steering committee to stop recruitment into a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a psychological intervention for personality disorder led to an investigation of the recording of harm in trials funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). Methods The protocols and final reports of all 82 NIHR trials funded between 1995 and 2013 were examined for the reporting of adverse events. These were subdivided by category of intervention. Results None of the psychological intervention trials mentioned the occurrence of an adverse event in their final report. Trials of drug treatments were more likely to mention adverse events in their protocols compared with those using psychological treatments. When adverse events were mentioned, the protocols of psychological interventions relied heavily on severe adverse events guidelines from the National Research Ethics Service (NRES), which were developed for drug rather than psychological interventions and so may not be appropriate for the latter. Conclusions This survey supported the belief that the reporting of adverse events in psychological treatments is weak and the criteria used may not be appropriate. Recommendations are made as to how current practice might be improved.",Trials,CLINIC
0.334655214,14697001,Exchange of Disfluency With Age From Function Words to Content Words in Spanish Speakers Who Stutter," The main purpose of the present study was to examine whether the developmental change in loci of disfluency from mainly function words to mainly content words, observed for English speakers who stutter ( P. Howell, J. Au-Yeung, & S. Sackin, 1999 ), also occurs for comparable Spanish speakers who stutter. The participants were divided into 5 age groups. There were 7 participants in Group 1, from 3 to 5 years old; 11 in Group 2, from 6 to 9 years old; 10 in Group 3, from 10 to 11 years old; 9 in Group 4, from 12 to 16 years old; and 9 in Group 5, from 20 to 68 years old. Across all groups, 36 of the 46 participants were male. The study method involved segmenting speech into phonological words (PWs) that consist of an obligatory content word with optional function words that precede and follow it. The initial function words in the PWs were examined to establish whether they have a higher disfluency rate than the final ones ( J. Au-Yeung, P. Howell, & L. Pilgrim, 1998 ). Disfluency on function words in a PW was higher when the word occurred before a content word rather than after a content word for all age groups. Disfluencies on function and content words were then examined to determine whether they change over age groups in the same way as for English speakers who stutter ( Howell et al., 1999 ). The rate of disfluency on function words was higher than that on content words, particularly in the youngest speakers. Function word disfluency rate dropped off and content word disfluency rate increased across age groups. These patterns are similar to those reported for English. Possible explanations for these similarities across the two languages are discussed. ","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",PSYCH
0.828213601,27777741,Livestock guardian dogs as surrogate top predators? How Maremma sheepdogs affect a wildlife community,"Abstract Use of livestock guardian dogs ( LGD s) to reduce predation on livestock is increasing. However, how these dogs influence the activity of wildlife, including predators, is not well understood. We used pellet counts and remote cameras to investigate the effects of free ranging LGD s on four large herbivores (eastern gray kangaroo, common wombat, swamp wallaby, and sambar deer) and one mesopredator (red fox) in Victoria, Australia. Generalized mixed models and one‚Äê and two‚Äêspecies detection models were used to assess the influence of the presence of LGD s on detection of the other species. We found avoidance of LGD s in four species. Swamp wallabies and sambar deer were excluded from areas occupied by LGD s; gray kangaroos showed strong spatial and temporal avoidance of LGD areas; foxes showed moderately strong spatial and temporal avoidance of LGD areas. The effect of LGD s on wombats was unclear. Avoidance of areas with LGD s by large herbivores can benefit livestock production by reducing competition for pasture and disease transmission from wildlife to livestock, and providing managers with better control over grazing pressure. Suppression of mesopredators could benefit the small prey of those species. Synthesis and applications: In pastoral areas, LGD s can function as a surrogate top‚Äêorder predator, controlling the local distribution and affecting behavior of large herbivores and mesopredators. LGD s may provide similar ecological functions to those that in many areas have been lost with the extirpation of native large carnivores.",Ecology and evolution,ECO
0.930363557,23084779,Wavelet Analysis of DNA Walks on the Human and Chimpanzee MAGE/CSAG-palindromes,"The palindrome is one class of symmetrical duplications with reverse complementary characters, which is widely distributed in many organisms. Graphical representation of DNA sequence provides a simple way of viewing and comparing various genomic structures. Through 3-D DNA walk analysis, the similarity and differences in nucleotide composition, as well as the evolutionary relationship between human and chimpanzee MAGE/CSAG-palindromes, can be clearly revealed. Further wavelet analysis indicated that duplicated segments have irregular patterns compared to their surrounding sequences. However, sequence similarity analysis suggests that there is possible common ancestor between human and chimpanzee MAGE/CSAG-palindromes. Based on the specific distribution and orientation of the repeated sequences, a simple possible evolutionary model of the palindromes is suggested, which may help us to better understand the evolutionary course of the genes and the symmetrical sequences.","Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",CS
0.716035125,31164879,Diversity and Functional Properties of Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated From Wild Fruits and Flowers Present in Northern Argentina,"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are capable of converting carbohydrate substrates into organic acids (mainly lactic acid) and producing a wide range of metabolites. Due to their interesting beneficial properties, LAB are widely used as starter cultures, as probiotics, and as microbial cell factories. Exploring LAB present in unknown niches may lead to the isolation of unique species or strains with relevant technological properties. Autochthonous rather than allochthonous starter cultures are preferred in the current industry of fermented food products, due to better adaptation and performance of autochthonous strains to the matrix they originate from. In this work, the lactic microbiota of eight different wild tropical types of fruits and four types of flowers were studied. The ability of the isolated strains to produce metabolites of interest to the food industry was evaluated. The presence of 21 species belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Fructobacillus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc , and Weissella was evidenced by using culture-dependent techniques. The isolated LAB corresponded to 95 genotypically differentiated strains by applying rep-PCR and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene; subsequently, representative strains of the different isolated species were studied for technological properties, such as fast growth rate and acidifying capacity; pectinolytic and cinnamoyl esterase activities, and absence of biogenic amine biosynthesis. Additionally, the strains' capacity to produce ethyl esters as well as mannitol was evaluated. The isolated fruit- and flower-origin LAB displayed functional properties that validate their potential use in the manufacture of fermented fruit-based products setting the background for the design of novel functional foods.",Frontiers in microbiology,ANIMAL

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of two polymorphisms (rs2026458 and rs9349379) of the PHACTR1 gene in the susceptibility to the risk of developing premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in the Mexican population. The genotype analysis was performed using 5‚Äôexonuclease TaqMan genotyping assays in a group of 994 patients with premature CAD and 703 controls. A similar genotype distribution of rs2026458 was observed in both groups; however, under an additive model adjusted by age, body mass index, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, the rs9349379 G allele was associated with a higher risk for developing premature CAD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03‚Äì1.46, p -value ( p ) = 0.024). The two PHACTR1 polymorphisms were not in linkage disequilibrium.

The ‚ÄúGELFrEE‚Äù (i.e., gel-eluted liquid fraction entrapment electrophoresis) approach is implemented by use of Tris-glycine and Tris-tricine gel systems applied to human cytosolic and nuclear extracts from HeLa S3 cells, to achieve a MW-based fractionation of proteins from 5 to >100 kDa in 1 h. For top-down tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS) of the low-mass proteome (5‚Äì25 kDa), between 5 and 8 gel-elution (GE) fractions are sampled by nanocapillary-LC-MS/MS with 12 or 14.5 tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers. Single injections give about 40 detectable proteins, about half of which yield automated ProSight identifications. Reproducibility metrics of the system are presented, along with comparative analysis of protein targets in mitotic versus asynchronous cells. We forward this basic 2D approach to facilitate wider implementation of top-down mass spectrometry and a variety of other protein separation and/or characterization approaches.

0.421011892,30240113,Spectrally and spatially resolved laser‚Äêinduced photobleaching of endogenous flavin fluorescence in cardiac myocytes,"Abstract Naturally occurring endogenous fluorescence of flavins, arising in response to excitation by visible light, offers broad opportunity to investigate mitochondrial metabolic state directly in living cells and tissues, including in clinical settings. However, photobleaching, the loss of the autofluorescence intensity following prolonged exposure to light is an inherent phenomenon occurring during the fluorescence acquisition, which can have a negative impact on the recorded data, particularly in the context of measurement of metabolic modulations in pathophysiological conditions. In the presented study, we present a detailed analysis of endogenous flavins fluorescence photobleaching arising in living cardiac cells during spectrally‚Äêresolved confocal imaging. We demonstrate significant nonuniform photobleaching related to different bleaching rates of individual flavin components, resolved by linear spectral unmixing of the recorded signals. Induced photodamage was without effect on the cell morphology, but lead to significant modifications of the cell responsiveness to metabolic modulators and its contractility, suggesting functional metabolic alterations in the recorded cells. These findings point to the necessity of inducing limited photobleaching during metabolic screening in all studies involving visible light excitation and fluorescence acquisition in living cells. ¬© 2018 The Authors Cytometry Part A published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Society for Advancement of Cytometry",Cytometry.

0.829565877,28146230,A Framework to Improve Surgeon Communication in High-Stakes Surgical Decisions: Best Case/Worst Case,"  Importance  Although many older adults prefer to avoid burdensome interventions with limited ability to preserve their functional status, aggressive treatments, including surgery, are common near the end of life. Shared decision making is critical to achieve value-concordant treatment decisions and minimize unwanted care. However, communication in the acute inpatient setting is challenging.    Objective  To evaluate the proof of concept of an intervention to teach surgeons to use the Best Case/Worst Case framework as a strategy to change surgeon communication and promote shared decision making during high-stakes surgical decisions.    Design, Setting, and Participants  Our prospective pre-post study was conducted from June 2014 to August 2015 and data were analyzed using a mixed methods approach. The data were drawn from decision-making conversations between 32 older inpatients with an acute nonemergent surgical problem, 30 family members, and 25 surgeons at 1 tertiary care hospital in Madison, Wisconsin.    Intervention  A 2-hour training session to teach each study-enrolled surgeon to use the Best Case/Worst Case communication framework.    Main Outcome and Measures  We scored conversation transcripts using OPTION 5, an observer measure of shared decision making, and used qualitative content analysis to characterize patterns in conversation structure, description of outcomes and deliberation over treatment alternatives.    Results  The study participants were patients aged 68 to 95 years (n=32), 44% of whom had 5 or more comorbid conditions; family members of patients (n=30); and surgeons (n=17). The median OPTION 5 score improved from 41 pre-intervention (interquartile range 26‚Äì66) to 74 after Best Case/Worst Case training (interquartile range 60‚Äì81). Before training, surgeons described the patient‚Äôs problem in conjunction with an operative solution, directed deliberation over options, listed discrete procedural risks and did not integrate preferences into a treatment recommendation. After training, surgeons using Best Case/Worst Case clearly presented a choice between treatments, described a range of postoperative trajectories including functional decline and involved patients and families in deliberation.    Conclusions and Relevance  Using the Best Case/Worst Case framework changed surgeon communication by shifting the focus of decision-making conversations from an isolated surgical problem to a discussion about treatment alternatives and outcomes. This intervention can help surgeons structure challenging conversations to promote shared decision making in the acute setting.  ",JAMA surgery,CLINIC
0.128556562,20852893,Rare variation at the  TNFAIP3  locus and susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted using commercial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays have proven to be a powerful tool for the detection of common disease susceptibility variants. However, their utility for the detection of lower frequency variants is yet to be practically investigated. Here we describe the application of a rare variant collapsing method to a large genome-wide SNP dataset, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium rheumatoid arthritis (RA) GWAS. We partitioned the data into gene-centric bins and collapsed genotypes of low frequency variants (defined here as MAF ‚â§0.05) into a single count coupled with univariate analysis. We then prioritised gene regions for further investigation in an independent cohort of 3,355 cases and 2,427 controls based on rare variant signal p value and prior evidence to support involvement in RA. A total of 14,536 gene bins were investigated in the primary analysis and signals mapping to the TNFAIP3 and chr17q24 loci were selected for further investigation. We detected replicating association to low frequency variants in the TNFAIP3 gene (combined p =¬†6.6¬†√ó¬†10 ‚àí6 ). Even though rare variants are not well-represented and can be difficult to genotype in GWAS, our study supports the application of low frequency variant collapsing methods to genome-wide SNP datasets as a means of exploiting data that are routinely ignored.

Here, we provide an in silico proof-of-concept by extracting novel information from a high-quality mRNA expression dataset, originally published in 2001, using state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches. Methods: The dataset consists of histologically defined cases of lung adenocarcinoma (AD), squamous (SQ) cell carcinoma, small-cell lung cancer, carcinoid, metastasis (breast and colon AD), and normal lung specimens (203 samples in total). A battery of statistical tests was used for identifying differential gene expressions, diagnostic and prognostic genes, enriched gene ontologies, and signaling pathways. Results: Our results showed that gene expressions faithfully recapitulate immunohistochemical subtype markers, as chromogranin A in carcinoids, cytokeratin 5, p63 in SQ, and TTF1 in non-squamous types. Moreover, biological information with putative clinical relevance was revealed as potentially novel diagnostic genes for each subtype with specificity 93‚Äì100% (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.93‚Äì1.00). Cancer subtypes were characterized by (a) differential expression of treatment target genes as TYMS , HER2 , and HER3 and (b) overrepresentation of treatment-related pathways like cell cycle, DNA repair, and ERBB pathways. The vascular smooth muscle contraction, leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, and actin cytoskeleton pathways were overexpressed in normal tissue. Conclusion: Reanalysis of this public dataset displayed the known biological features of lung cancer subtypes and revealed novel pathways of potentially clinical importance. The findings also support our hypothesis that even old omics data of high quality can be a source of significant biological information when appropriate bioinformatics methods are used.",Frontiers in oncology,ONCO

This catalyst had high acid density as characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDX) and Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) method analyses. It was further used to catalyze the esterification of oleic acid and one-step conversion of non-pretreated Jatropha oil to biodiesel. The effects of catalyst loading, reaction temperature and oil-to-methanol molar ratio, on the catalytic activity of the esterification were investigated. Results The highest catalytic activity was achieved with a 96.1% esterification rate, and the catalyst can be reused three times with little deactivation under optimized conditions. Biodiesel production from Jatropha oil was studied under such conditions. It was found that 96.3% biodiesel yield from non-pretreated Jatropha oil with high-acid value (12.7 mg KOH/g) could be achieved. Conclusions The catalyst can be easily separated for reuse. This single-step process could be a potential route for biodiesel production from high-acid value oil by simplifying the procedure and reducing costs.",Biotechnology for biofuels,ENG

Here, we introduce an ultrathin, compliant skin-like sensor/actuator technology that can pliably laminate onto the epidermis to provide continuous, accurate thermal characterizations that are unavailable with other methods. Examples include non-invasive spatial mapping of skin temperature with millikelvin precision, and simultaneous quantitative assessment of tissue thermal conductivity.

Nonlinear principal components analysis was undertaken to identify dimensions that might represent latent variables. Correlations between latent variables and EPDS >12 were assessed by logistic regression. A five-dimension solution was identified, which accounted for 51% of the variance among the items studied. The five dimensions identified were maternal responsiveness, social exclusion, infant behavior, migrant social isolation, and family size. In addition, the variable maternal expectation contributed significantly to total variance and was included in the regression analysis. Regression on EPDS >12 was predictive for all variables except for maternal responsiveness, which was considered an outcome variable.

Fifty-two undergraduate males were tested for a minor, fictitious medical condition (‚ÄòTAA deficiency‚Äô) in a paradigm that was developed to examine the thoughts and behaviours of individuals who have just received unfavourable medical news. In a variation on the classic paradigm, all participants were told that they had ‚ÄòTAA deficiency,‚Äô after which they rated the seriousness and prevalence of that condition as well as 19 other actual conditions. Higher testosterone levels were significantly correlated with lower estimates of both the seriousness and prevalence of TAA deficiency as well as lower median seriousness and prevalence estimates of the 19 actual conditions. Findings are discussed in light of current research in the field of behavioural endocrinology. This study provides preliminary evidence that individual differences in assessments of threatening health information may be associated with neurobiological characteristics.

We observed 147 consultations by 34 GPs (17 trainers and 17 trainees). EBM behaviour was rarely visible in GPs‚Äô decision-making. When interviewing the GPs, we found that aspects of EBM that played a role in decision-making were not discussed with the patient. Explicit consideration of all aspects of EBM would make EBM measurable and GPs more aware of the foundations of their decisions. EBM behaviour is difficult to observe during GP consultations and therefore cannot be assessed through observations alone.",Perspectives on medical education,CLINIC
0.648540518,30804973,"Iron and Phosphate Deficiency Regulators Concertedly Control Coumarin Profiles in  Arabidopsis thaliana  Roots During Iron, Phosphate, and Combined Deficiencies","Plants face varying nutrient conditions, to which they have to adapt to. Adaptive responses are nutrient-specific and strategies to ensure supply and homeostasis for one nutrient might be opposite to another one, as shown for phosphate (P i ) and iron (Fe) deficiency responses, where many genes are regulated in an opposing manner. This was also observed on the metabolite levels. Whereas root and exudate levels of catechol-type coumarins, phenylpropanoid-derived 2-benzopyranones, which facilitate Fe acquisition, are elevated after Fe deficiency, they are decreased after P i deficiency. Exposing plants to combined P i and Fe deficiency showed that the generation of coumarin profiles in Arabidopsis thaliana roots by P i deficiency considerably depends on the availability of Fe. Similarly, the effect of Fe deficiency on coumarin profiles is different at low compared to high P i availability. These findings suggest a fine-tuning of coumarin profiles, which depends on Fe and P i availability. T-DNA insertion lines exhibiting aberrant expression of genes involved in the regulation of P i starvation responses ( PHO1, PHR1, bHLH32, PHL1, SPX1 ) and Fe starvation responses ( BRUTUS, PYE, bHLH104, FIT ) were used to analyze the regulation of the generation of coumarin profiles in Arabidopsis thaliana roots by P i , Fe, and combined P i and Fe deficiency. The analysis revealed a role of several Fe-deficiency response regulators in the regulation of Fe and of P i deficiency-induced coumarin profiles as well as for P i deficiency response regulators in the regulation of P i and of Fe deficiency-induced coumarin profiles. Additionally, the regulation of Fe deficiency-induced coumarin profiles by Fe deficiency response regulators is influenced by P i availability. Conversely, regulation of P i deficiency-induced coumarin profiles by P i deficiency response regulators is modified by Fe availability.",Frontiers in plant science,ANIMAL

The 2D nature of interfaces present unique challenges and opportunities: coupling between the 2D films and the bulk fluids complicates the measurement of surface dynamic properties, but allows the interfacial microstructure to be directly visualized during deformation. Here we present a novel technique that combines active microrheology with fluorescence microscopy to visualize fluid interfaces as they deform under applied stress, allowing structure and rheology to be correlated on the micron-scale in monolayer films. We show that even simple, single-component lipid monolayers can exhibit viscoelasticity, history dependence, a yield stress and hours-long time scales for elastic recoil and aging. Simultaneous visualization of the monolayer under stress shows that the rich dynamical response results from the cooperative dynamics and deformation of liquid-crystalline domains and their boundaries. Two-dimensional fluid interfaces are ubiquitous, but studying their surface dynamic properties is difficult because of coupling between the film and bulk fluid.

0.273757429,23387352,Mixtures of Supported and Hybrid Lipid Membranes on Heterogeneously Modified Silica Nanoparticles," Simple supported lipid bilayers do not accurately reflect the complex heterogeneity of cellular membranes; however, surface modification makes it possible to tune membrane properties to better mimic biological systems. Here, 3-[2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethylamino]propyl-trimethoxysilane (DETAS), a silica modifier, facilitated formation of supported lipid bilayers on silica nanoparticles. Evidence for a stable supported bilayer came from the successful entrapment of a soluble fluorophore within an interstitial water layer. A fluorescence-quenching assay that utilized a pore-forming peptide was used to demonstrate the existence of two separate lipid leaflets. In this assay, fluorescence was quenched by dithionite in roughly equal proportions prior to and after addition of melittin. When a hydrophobic modifier, octadecyltriethoxysilane, was co-deposited on the nanoparticles with DETAS, there was a decrease in the amount of supported bilayer on the nanoparticles and an increase in the quantity of hybrid membrane. This allowed for a controlled mixture of two distinct types of membranes on a single substrate, one separated by a water cushion and the other anchored directly on the surface, thereby providing a new mimic of cellular membranes.

0.935346868,27596486,EMBalance - validation of a decision support system in the early diagnostic evaluation and management plan formulation of balance disorders in primary care: study protocol of a feasibility randomised controlled trial,"Background Balance problems are caused by multiple factors and often lead to falls and related fractures, bringing large socio-economic costs. The complexity of balance control mechanisms, the lack of medical expertise, and the absence of specialised equipment contribute to the delayed or incorrect diagnosis and management ofthese patients. Advances in computer science have allowed the development of computer systems that support clinical diagnosis and treatment decisions based on individualised patient data. The aim of the EMBalance decision support system (DSS) is to support doctors facing this clinical challenge, to make a definitive diagnosis and implement an effective management plan. The EMBalance study will determine the accuracy of this supportive tool when used by non-specialist doctors. This study is funded by the European Union‚Äôs Seventh Framework Programme. Methods/design EMBalance is a proof-of-concept study designed as a non-commercial, international, multi-centre, single-blind, parallel-group randomised controlled trial to be carried out at four clinical sites in the United Kingdom, Germany, Greece and Belgium. The study is comprised of three stages: internal pilot, phase I (diagnosis) and stage II (management). For this purpose, 200 patients presenting with persistent dizziness (>3 months‚Äô duration) to primary care services will be randomised to either the intervention group (diagnostic assessment with the DSS) or a control group (diagnostic assessment without the DSS). Patients allocated to the intervention group will be assessed by a doctor with the support of the EMBalance DSS, while patients allocated to the control group will receive a visit as per standard practice. Ultimately, all patients‚Äô diagnoses and management plans will be certified by a consultant in neuro-otology. Discussion EMBalance is the first trial to test the accuracy of a DSS in both the diagnosis of and the management plan for vestibular disorders across the healthcare systems of four different countries. The EMBalance study is the result of a combined effort of engineers and physicians to develop an accurate tool to support non-specialist doctors, with no risk for the patient. This trial will provide reliable information about the benefits of implementing DSSs in primary care while supporting the feasibility of testing the EMBalance algorithms in further research.

0.067953448,30367621,Sorafenib and docosahexaenoic acid act in synergy to suppress cancer cell viability: a role of heme oxygenase 1,"Background Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that has anticancer activity. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is a potential therapeutic target due to its cytoprotective activity in cancer cells. We recently reported that DHA induces HO-1 gene transcription in human cancer cells by augmenting the degradation of Bach1 protein, which functions as a negative regulator of HO-1. Since the degradation of Bach1 protein relies on protein phosphorylation, we hypothesized that DHA-induced HO-1 gene transcription could be attenuated by kinase inhibitors, resulting in an enhanced cytotoxicity. Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was first applied to test our hypothesis. Methods Human cancer cell lines and a xenograft nude mouse model were applied to test our hypothesis. Gene expression was analyzed by western blot analysis and reporter gene assay. Cell viability was analyzed using a colorimetric assay. Isobologram was applied to analyze drug action. Results Pretreatment of cancer cells with Sorafenib significantly attenuated DHA-induced degradation of Bach1 protein. Consequently, DHA-induced HO-1 gene transcription was reversed by Sorafenib as evidenced by western blot and reporter gene analysis. Sorafenib acted synergistically with DHA to suppress cancer cell viability in various human cancer cell lines and suppressed tumor xenograft growth in mice fed a fish oil enriched diet (high n-3/DHA), as compared to mice fed a corn oil (high n-6) diet. Screening of the NCI-Oncology Drug Set IV identified a group of anticancer compounds, including Sorafenib, which enhanced DHA‚Äôs cytotoxicity, as well as a set of compounds that attenuated DHA‚Äôs cytotoxicity. Conclusions We demonstrate that sorafenib attenuates DHA-induced HO-1 expression and acts in synergy with DHA to suppress cancer cell viability and tumor growth. Considering the known health benefits of DHA and the clinical effectiveness of Sorafenib, their combination is an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer.",BMC cancer,ONCO
0.649873753,21599885,No evidence for association between  SLC11A1  and visceral leishmaniasis in India,"Background SLC11A1 has pleiotropic effects on macrophage function and remains a strong candidate for infectious disease susceptibility. 5' and/or 3' polymorphisms have been associated with tuberculosis, leprosy, and visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Most studies undertaken to date were under-powered, and none has been replicated within a population. Association with tuberculosis has replicated variably across populations. Here we investigate SLC11A1 and VL in India. Methods Nine polymorphisms (rs34448891, rs7573065, rs2276631, rs3731865, rs17221959, rs2279015, rs17235409, rs17235416, rs17229009) that tag linkage disequilibrium blocks across SLC11A1 were genotyped in primary family-based (313 cases; 176 families) and replication (941 cases; 992 controls) samples. Family- and population-based analyses were performed to look for association between SLC11A1 variants and VL. Quantitative RT/PCR was used to compare SLC11A1 expression in mRNA from paired splenic aspirates taken before and after treatment from 24 VL patients carrying different genotypes at the functional promoter GT n polymorphism (rs34448891). Results No associations were observed between VL and polymorphisms at SLC11A1 that were either robust to correction for multiple testing or replicated across primary and replication samples. No differences in expression of SLC11A1 were observed when comparing pre- and post-treatment samples, or between individuals carrying different genotypes at the GT n repeat. Conclusions This is the first well-powered study of SLC11A1 as a candidate for VL, which we conclude does not have a major role in regulating VL susceptibility in India.",BMC medical genetics,POPGENE
0.410454348,16525047,Novel Subcellular Distribution Pattern of A-Type K +  Channels on Neuronal Surface," Potassium channels comprise the most diverse family of ion channels. In nerve cells, their critical roles in synaptic integration and output generation have been demonstrated. Here, we provide evidence for a distribution that predicts a novel role of K + channels in the CNS. Our experiments revealed a highly selective clustering of the Kv4.3 A-type K + channel subunits at specialized junctions between climbing fibers and cerebellar GABAergic interneurons. High-resolution ultrastructural and immunohistochemical experiments demonstrated that these junctions are distinct from known chemical and electrical (gap junctions) synapses and also from puncta adherentia. Each cerebellar interneuron contains many such K + channel-rich specializations, which seem to be distributed throughout the somatodendritic surface. We also show that such K + channel-rich specializations are not only present in the cerebellum but are widespread in the rat CNS. For example, mitral cells of the main olfactory bulb establish Kv4.2subunit-positive specializations with each other. At these specializations, both apposing membranes have a high density of K + channels, indicating bidirectional signaling. Similar specializations with pronounced coclustering of the Kv4.2 and 4.3 subunits were observed between nerve cells in the medial nucleus of the habenula. Based on our results and on the known properties of A-type K + channels, we propose that strategically clustered K + channels at unique membrane specializations could mediate a novel type of communication between nerve cells.

Studies were carried out on Tianfu ducks on days 24 and 27 of embryogenesis (E24 and E27) along with days 20, 70, and 200 of postnatal development (P20, P70, and P200). Results showed that the percentage of G 0 /G 1 bursa cells significantly increased between E24 and P200 while the percentage of cells in the S phase or G 2 + M phase as well as the proliferating index obviously decreased during the same period. Proliferation cell nuclear antigen was detected in lymphocyte and interfollicular epithelium. The proliferative lymphocyte density tended to decrease from E24 to P200. Apoptotic bodies in macrophages, free apoptotic bodies, or nuclei with condensed chromatin in lymphocytes in follicles were identified by transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling. Both flow cytometry and microscopic analysis reveal that the proportion of apoptotic cells and apoptotic lymphocyte density increased from E24 to P20, fell on P70, then rose again on P200.

0.009700614,27670607,Mechanistic and Evolutionary Insights from Comparative Enzymology of Phosphomonoesterases and Phosphodiesterases across the Alkaline Phosphatase Superfamily,"Naively one might have expected an early division between phosphate monoesterases and diesterases of the alkaline phosphatase (AP) superfamily. On the contrary, prior results and our structural and biochemical analyses of phosphate monoesterase PafA, from Chryseobacterium meningosepticum , indicate similarities to a superfamily phosphate diesterase [ Xanthomonas citri nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP)] and distinct differences from the three metal ion AP superfamily monoesterase, from Escherichia coli AP ( Ec AP). We carried out a series of experiments to map out and learn from the differences and similarities between these enzymes. First, we asked why there would be independent instances of monoesterases in the AP superfamily? PafA has a much weaker product inhibition and slightly higher activity relative to Ec AP, suggesting that different metabolic evolutionary pressures favored distinct active-site architectures. Next, we addressed the preferential phosphate monoester and diester catalysis of PafA and NPP, respectively. We asked whether the >80% sequence differences throughout these scaffolds provide functional specialization for each enzyme‚Äôs cognate reaction. In contrast to expectations from this model, PafA and NPP mutants with the common subset of active-site groups embedded in each native scaffold had the same monoesterase:diesterase specificities; thus, the >10 7 -fold difference in native specificities appears to arise from distinct interactions at a single phosphoryl substituent. We also uncovered striking mechanistic similarities between the PafA and Ec AP monoesterases, including evidence for ground-state destabilization and functional active-site networks that involve different active-site groups but may play analogous catalytic roles. Discovering common network functions may reveal active-site architectural connections that are critical for function, and identifying regions of functional modularity may facilitate the design of new enzymes from existing promiscuous templates. More generally, comparative enzymology and analysis of catalytic promiscuity can provide mechanistic and evolutionary insights.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,CHEM
0.932786133,31114523,Improving Self-Perceived Emotional Intelligence in Occupational Therapy Students Through Practical Training,"Background: In the field of healthcare, higher skills in emotional intelligence (EI) have been proven to have a positive impact on healthcare professionals in general and occupational therapists in particular and also on teamwork and patient care. The purpose of this research was to determine whether performing practical work included in the undergraduate Occupational Therapy program improves students' self-perceived EI, and whether there are any differences in the latter depending on the area in which this practical training is performed. Methods: It was conducted a multicenter, quasi-experimental, pre-post study with Occupational Therapy undergraduate students in the 2016‚Äì2017 academic year. A total of 184 students met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 10 (5.40%) declined to participate; therefore, the participation rate was 94.60% and the initial sample comprised 174 students. Mean age was 21.34 years ( SD = 2.54) and 84.50% ( n = 147) were women. Students' self-perceived EI was measured with the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24). This measure was completed in the two weeks prior to the start of the practical training period and one week after the end of it. McNemar-Bowker and McNemar tests were used to analyze the differences in self-perceived EI between these two points in time. Results: After the practical training, an improvement in self-perceived EI was observed in women (Emotional Attention, Emotional Clarity, and Emotional Regulation dimensions). Regarding areas of practical training, results showed an improvement in EI in women who had received practical training in the areas of Physical Rehabilitation, Mental Health and Geriatrics and Gerontology. Conclusions: The findings contribute to a better understanding of the relation between practical training and an improvement in self-perceived EI. This insight can help make changes in the teaching methodology to enhance the emotional skills needed for a better professional performance.",Frontiers in psychology,PSYCH
0.987494059,31481029,Multi-trait meta-analyses reveal 25 quantitative trait loci for economically important traits in Brown Swiss cattle,"Background Little is known about the genetic architecture of economically important traits in Brown Swiss cattle because only few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been carried out in this breed. Moreover, most GWAS have been performed for single traits, thus not providing detailed insights into potentially existing pleiotropic effects of trait-associated loci. Results To compile a comprehensive catalogue of large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) segregating in Brown Swiss cattle, we carried out association tests between partially imputed genotypes at 598,016 SNPs and daughter-derived phenotypes for more than 50 economically important traits, including milk production, growth and carcass quality, body conformation, reproduction and calving traits in 4578 artificial insemination bulls from two cohorts of Brown Swiss cattle (Austrian-German and Swiss populations). Across-cohort multi-trait meta-analyses of the results from the single-trait GWAS revealed 25 quantitative trait loci (QTL; P <‚Äâ8.36‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10 ‚àí‚Äâ8 ) for economically relevant traits on 17 Bos taurus autosomes (BTA). Evidence of pleiotropy was detected at five QTL located on BTA5, 6, 17, 21 and 25. Of these, two QTL at BTA6:90,486,780 and BTA25:1,455,150 affect a diverse range of economically important traits, including traits related to body conformation, calving, longevity and milking speed. Furthermore, the QTL at BTA6:90,486,780 seems to be a target of ongoing selection as evidenced by an integrated haplotype score of 2.49 and significant changes in allele frequency over the past 25‚Äâyears, whereas either no or only weak evidence of selection was detected at all other QTL. Conclusions Our findings provide a comprehensive overview of QTL segregating in Brown Swiss cattle. Detected QTL explain between 2 and 10% of the variation in the estimated breeding values and thus may be considered as the most important QTL segregating in the Brown Swiss cattle breed. Multi-trait association testing boosts the power to detect pleiotropic QTL and assesses the full spectrum of phenotypes that are affected by trait-associated variants.

Methods  We compared skeletal muscle ultrasound images from adults with AMD (n=10) to other myopathies (n=81) and, in AMD, compared qualitative (Heckmatt) and quantitative (backscatter) ultrasound measurements with strength and function.    Results  Qualitative ultrasound was abnormal in at least one muscle in all AMD subjects. Ultrasound patterns specific for AMD compared to other myopathies were: normal triceps brachii despite abnormalities in elbow flexors (89 vs. 17%, p<0.0001), focal abnormalities affecting deep more than superficial biceps brachii (40 vs. 4%, p=0.002), and more severe involvement of vastus intermedius than rectus femoris (40 vs. 11%, p=0.03). In AMD, both qualitative (Heckmatt) and quantitative (backscatter) ultrasound measures increased with decreasing strength and function.

0.971917124,28982551,A cell-based high throughput screening assay for the discovery of cGAS-STING pathway agonists," Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein that serves as a molecular hub for activation of interferon and inflammatory cytokine response by multiple cellular DNA sensors. Not surprisingly, STING has been demonstrated to play an important role in host defense against microorganisms and pharmacologic activation of STING is considered as an attractive strategy to treat viral diseases and boost antitumor immunity. In light of this we established a HepAD38-derived reporter cell line that expresses firefly luciferase in response to the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway for high throughput screening (HTS) of small molecular human STING agonists. This cell-based reporter assay required only 4 h treatment with a reference STING agonist to induce a robust luciferase signal and was demonstrated to have an excellent performance in HTS format. By screening 16,000 compounds, a dispiro diketopiperzine (DSDP) compound was identified to induce proinflammatory cytokine response in a manner dependent on the expression of functional human STING, but not mouse STING. Moreover, we showed that DSDP induced an interferon-dominant cytokine response in human skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which in turn potently suppressed the replication of yellow fever virus, dengue virus and Zika virus. We have thus established a robust cell-based assay system suitable for rapid discovery and mechanistic analyses of cGAS-STING pathway agonists. Identification of DSDP as a human STING agonist enriches the pipelines of STING-targeting drug development for treatment of viral infections and cancers. ",Antiviral research,IMMUN

Methylation of BAF155 at R1064 was found to be an independent prognostic biomarker for cancer recurrence and to regulate breast cancer cell migration and metastasis. Furthermore, CARM1-mediated BAF155 methylation affects gene expression by directing methylated BAF155 to unique chromatin regions (e.g., c-Myc pathway genes).

0.644255275,29944343,Adsorption of PFOA at the Air-Water Interface during Transport in Unsaturated Porous Media," Miscible-displacement experiments are conducted with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to determine the contribution of adsorption at the air-water interface to retention during transport in water-unsaturated porous media.. Column experiments were conducted with two sands of different diameter; at different PFOA input concentrations, water saturations, and pore-water velocities to evaluate the impact of system variables on retardation. The breakthrough curves for unsaturated conditions exhibited greater retardation than those obtained for saturated conditions, demonstrating the significant impact of air-water interfacial adsorption on PFOA retention. Retardation was greater for lower water saturations and smaller grain diameter, consistent with the impact of system conditions on the magnitude of air-water interfacial area in porous media. Retardation was greater for lower input concentrations of PFOA for a given water saturation, consistent with the nonlinear nature of surfactant fluid-fluid interfacial adsorption. Retardation factors predicted using independently determined parameter values compared very well to the measured values. The results showed that adsorption at the air-water interface is a significant source of retention for PFOA, contributing approximately 50 to 75% of total retention, for the test systems. The significant magnitude of air-water interfacial adsorption measured in this work has ramifications for accurate determination of PFAS migration potential in vadose zones.

Attempts to delineate precise genetic contributions have met with limited success. There is an ongoing search for intermediate cognitive brain markers (endophenotypes) that may help clarify genetic contributions. The aim was to assess inhibitory control processes in unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients for the first time with objective tests.    Method:  The Intradimensional/Extradimensional Shift, Stop-Signal, and Cambridge Gamble tasks were administered to 20 unaffected first-degree relatives, 20 OCD patient probands with washing/checking symptoms, and 20 healthy matched comparison subjects without a family history of OCD.    Results:  Unaffected first-degree relatives and OCD patient probands showed cognitive inflexibility (extradimensional set shifting) and motor impulsivity (stop-signal reaction times). Decision making (Cambridge Gamble task) was intact.    Conclusions:  Deficits in cognitive flexibility and motor inhibition may represent cognitive endophenotypes for OCD. Such measures will play a key role in understanding genotype/phenotype associations for OCD and related spectrum conditions.  ",The American journal of psychiatry,PSYCH
0.127958398,28865310,Dynamic Range of Frontoparietal Functional Modulation is Associated with Working Memory Capacity Limitations in Older Adults," Older adults tend to over-activate regions throughout frontoparietal cortices and exhibit a reduced range of functional modulation during WM task performance compared to younger adults. While recent evidence suggests that reduced functional modulation is associated with poorer task performance, it remains unclear whether reduced range of modulation is indicative of general WM capacity-limitations. In the current study, we examined whether the range of functional modulation observed over multiple levels of WM task difficulty (N-Back) predicts in-scanner task performance and out-of-scanner psychometric estimates of WM capacity. Within our sample (60‚Äì77 years of age), age was negatively associated with frontoparietal modulation range. Individuals with greater modulation range exhibited more accurate N-Back performance. In addition, despite a lack of significant relationships between N-Back and complex span task performance, range of frontoparietal modulation during the N-Back significantly predicted domain-general estimates of WM capacity. Consistent with previous cross-sectional findings, older individuals with less modulation range exhibited greater activation at the lowest level of task difficulty but less activation at the highest levels of task difficulty. Our results are largely consistent with existing theories of neurocognitive aging (e.g. CRUNCH) but focus attention on dynamic range of functional modulation as a novel marker of WM capacity-limitations in older adults.

To further explore this relationship, 16S rDNA tag pyrosequencing was applied to samples taken at four time points from a styrene-degrading biofilter undergoing variable operating conditions. Changes in microbial structure were observed between different stages of biofilter operation, and the level of styrene concentration was revealed to be a critical factor affecting these changes. Bacterial genera Azoarcus and Pseudomonas were among the dominant classified genera in the biofilter. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and correlation analysis revealed that the genera Brevundimonas , Hydrogenophaga , and Achromobacter may play important roles in styrene degradation under increasing styrene concentrations. No significant correlations ( P >‚Äâ0.05) could be detected between biofilter operational/functional parameters and biodiversity measurements, although biological heterogeneity within biofilms and/or technical variability within pyrosequencing may have considerably affected these results. Percentages of selected bacterial taxonomic groups detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were compared to results from pyrosequencing in order to assess the effectiveness and limitations of each method for identifying each microbial taxon. Comparison of results revealed discrepancies between the two methods in the detected percentages of numerous taxonomic groups. Biases and technical limitations of both FISH and pyrosequencing, such as the binding of FISH probes to non-target microbial groups and lack of classification of sequences for defined taxonomic groups from pyrosequencing, may partially explain some differences between the two methods.

0.216384506,28028535,"Kinematics and dynamics of the East Pacific Rise linked to a stable, deep-mantle upwelling","Longitudinal stability of East Pacific Rise reflects coupling of deep-mantle buoyancy, mantle-wide flow, and seafloor spreading. Earth‚Äôs tectonic plates are generally considered to be driven largely by negative buoyancy associated with subduction of oceanic lithosphere. In this context, mid-ocean ridges (MORs) are passive plate boundaries whose divergence accommodates flow driven by subduction of oceanic slabs at trenches. We show that over the past 80 million years (My), the East Pacific Rise (EPR), Earth‚Äôs dominant MOR, has been characterized by limited ridge-perpendicular migration and persistent, asymmetric ridge accretion that are anomalous relative to other MORs. We reconstruct the subduction-related buoyancy fluxes of plates on either side of the EPR. The general expectation is that greater slab pull should correlate with faster plate motion and faster spreading at the EPR. Moreover, asymmetry in slab pull on either side of the EPR should correlate with either ridge migration or enhanced plate velocity in the direction of greater slab pull. Based on our analysis, none of the expected correlations are evident. This implies that other forces significantly contribute to EPR behavior. We explain these observations using mantle flow calculations based on globally integrated buoyancy distributions that require core-mantle boundary heat flux of up to 20 TW. The time-dependent mantle flow predictions yield a long-lived deep-seated upwelling that has its highest radial velocity under the EPR and is inferred to control its observed kinematics. The mantle-wide upwelling beneath the EPR drives horizontal components of asthenospheric flows beneath the plates that are similarly asymmetric but faster than the overlying surface plates, thereby contributing to plate motions through viscous tractions in the Pacific region.",Science advances,ENVIRON
0.317304135,26379688,Molecular dissection of  Phaseolus vulgaris  polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein 2 reveals the presence of hold/release domains affecting protein trafficking toward the cell wall,"The plant endomembrane system is massively involved in the synthesis, transport and secretion of cell wall polysaccharides and proteins; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying trafficking toward the apoplast are largely unknown. Besides constitutive, the existence of a regulated secretory pathway has been proposed. A polygalacturonase inhibitor protein (PGIP2), known to move as soluble cargo and reach the cell wall through a mechanism distinguishable from default, was dissected in its main functional domains (A, B, C, D), and C sub-fragments (C1‚Äì10), to identify signals essential for its regulated targeting. The secretion patterns of the fluorescent chimeras obtained by fusing different PGIP2 domains to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were analyzed. PGIP2 N -terminal and leucine-rich repeat domains (B and C, respectively) seem to operate as holding/releasing signals, respectively, during PGIP2 transit through the Golgi. The B domain slows down PGIP2 secretion by transiently interacting with Golgi membranes. Its depletion leads, in fact, to the secretion via default (Sp2-susceptible) of the ACD-GFP chimera faster than PGIP2. Depending on its length (at least the first 5 leucine-rich repeats are required), the C domain modulates B interaction with Golgi membranes allowing the release of chimeras and their extracellular secretion through a Sp2 independent pathway. The addition of the vacuolar sorting determinant Chi to PGIP2 diverts the path of the protein from cell wall to vacuole, suggesting that C domain is a releasing rather than a cell wall sorting signal.",Frontiers in plant science,ANIMAL
0.858525779,24305876,FGFR1-WNT-TGF-Œ≤ signaling in prostate cancer mouse models recapitulates human reactive stroma," The reactive stroma surrounding tumor lesions performs critical roles ranging from supporting tumor cell proliferation to inducing tumorigenesis and metastasis. Therefore, it is critical to understand the cellular components and signaling control mechanisms that underlay the etiology of reactive stroma. Previous studies have individually implicated fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and canonical WNT/Œ≤-catenin signaling in prostate cancer progression and the initiation and maintenance of a reactive stroma; however, both pathways are frequently found co-activated in cancer tissue. Using autochthonous transgenic mouse models for inducible FGFR1 (JOCK1) and prostate-specific and ubiquitously expressed inducible Œ≤-catenin (Pro-Cat and Ubi-Cat, respectively) and bigenic crosses between these lines (Pro-Cat √ó JOCK1 and Ubi-Cat √ó JOCK1), we describe WNT-induced synergistic acceleration of FGFR1-driven adenocarcinoma, associated with a pronounced fibroblastic reactive stroma activation surrounding prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) lesions found both in situ and reconstitution assays. Both mouse and human reactive stroma exhibited increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Œ≤) signaling adjacent to pathologic lesions likely contributing to invasion. Furthermore, elevated stromal TGF-Œ≤ signaling was associated with higher Gleason scores in archived human biopsies, mirroring murine patterns. Our findings establish the importance of the FGFR1-WNT-TGF-Œ≤ signaling axes as driving forces behind reactive stroma in aggressive prostate adenocarcinomas, deepening their relevance as therapeutic targets.

In B-deficient areas, B is often supplied as fertilizer, but excess B can be toxic to both plants and animals. Generation of B deficiency-tolerant plants could reduce B fertilizer use. Improved fertility under B-limiting conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana by overexpression of BOR1, a B transporter, has been reported, but the root growth was not improved by the BOR1 overexpression. In this study, we report that enhanced expression of NIP5;1 , a boric acid channel for efficient B uptake, resulted in improved root elongation under B-limiting conditions in A. thaliana . An NIP5;1 activation tag line, which has a T-DNA insertion with enhancer sequences near the NIP5;1 gene, showed improved root elongation under B limitation. We generated a construct which mimics the tag line: the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA promoter was inserted at 1,357‚Äâbp upstream of the NIP5;1 transcription initiation site. Introduction of this construct into the nip5;1-1 mutant and the BOR1 overexpresser resulted in enhanced expression of NIP5;1 and improved root elongation under low B supply.

Although botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) products are common treatments for various disorders, there is only one commercial BoNT/B product, whose low potency, likely stemming from low affinity toward its human receptor synaptotagmin 2 (hSyt2), has limited its therapeutic usefulness. We express and characterize two full-length recombinant BoNT/B1 proteins containing designed mutations E1191M/S1199Y (rBoNT/B1 MY ) and E1191Q/S1199W (rBoNT/B1 QW ) that enhance binding to hSyt2. In preclinical models including human-induced pluripotent stem cell neurons and a humanized transgenic mouse, this increased hSyt2 affinity results in high potency, comparable to that of BoNT/A. Last, we solve the cocrystal structure of rBoNT/B1 MY in complex with peptides of hSyt2 and its homolog hSyt1. We demonstrate that neuronal surface receptor binding limits the clinical efficacy of unmodified BoNT/B and that modified BoNT/B proteins have promising clinical potential.",Science advances,ENG

Methods: Eighteen patients with MCI and 20 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were scanned twice while performing an event-related verbal episodic encoding task. MCI participants were scanned before treatment and after approximately 3‚Äâmonths on donepezil; HC were untreated but rescanned at the same interval. Voxel-level analyses assessed treatment effects on activation profiles in MCI patients relative to retest changes in non-treated HC. Changes in task-related connectivity in medial temporal circuitry were also evaluated, as were associations between brain activation, task-related functional connectivity, task performance, and clinical measures of cognition. Results: At baseline, the MCI group showed reduced activation during encoding relative to HC in the right medial temporal lobe (MTL; hippocampal/parahippocampal) and additional regions, as well as attenuated task-related deactivation, relative to rest, in a medial parietal lobe cluster. After treatment, the MCI group showed normalized MTL activation and improved parietal deactivation. These changes were associated with cognitive performance. After treatment, the MCI group also demonstrated increased task-related functional connectivity from the right MTL cluster seed region to a network of other sites including the basal nucleus/caudate and bilateral frontal lobes. Increased functional connectivity was associated with improved task performance. Conclusion: Pharmacologic enhancement of cholinergic function in amnestic MCI is associated with changes in brain activation and functional connectivity during episodic memory processing which are in turn related to increased cognitive performance. fMRI is a promising biomarker for assessing treatment related changes in brain function.",Frontiers in psychiatry,NEURO

Here we report a study of cancer proteins in an extensive human protein-protein interaction network constructed by computational methods.    Results  We show that human proteins translated from known cancer genes exhibit a network topology that is different from that of proteins not documented as being mutated in cancer. In particular, cancer proteins show an increase in the number of proteins they interact with. They also appear to participate in central hubs rather than peripheral ones, mirroring their greater centrality and participation in networks that form the backbone of the proteome. Moreover, we show that cancer proteins contain a high ratio of highly promiscuous structural domains, i.e., domains with a high propensity for mediating protein interactions. These observations indicate an underlying evolutionary distinction between the two groups of proteins, reflecting the central roles of proteins, whose mutations lead to cancer.

However, limited drug loading (DL) and insufficient drug release at the tumor site remain the main obstacles in developing macrophage-based delivery systems. In this study, we constructed a biomimetic delivery system (BDS) by loading doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into a mouse macrophage-like cell line (RAW264.7), hoping that the newly constructed BDS could perfectly combine the tumor-tropic ability of macrophages and the photothermal property of rGO. Results At the same DOX concentration, the macrophages could absorb more DOX/PEG-BPEI-rGO than free DOX. The tumor-tropic capacity of RAW264.7 cells towards RM-1 mouse prostate cancer cells did not undergo significant change after drug loading in vitro and in vivo. PEG-BPEI-rGO encapsulated in the macrophages could effectively convert the absorbed near-infrared light into heat energy, causing rapid release of DOX. The BDS showed excellent anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. Conclusions The BDS that we developed in this study had the following characteristic features: active targeting of tumor cells, stimuli-release triggered by near-infrared laser (NIR), and effective combination of chemotherapy and photothermotherapy. Using the photothermal effect produced by PEG-BPEI-rGO and DOX released from the macrophages upon NIR irradiation, MAs-DOX/PEG-BPEI-rGO exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth.",Journal of nanobiotechnology,ENG
0.586138326,17618127,Leptin Promotes Rapid Dynamic Changes in Hippocampal Dendritic Morphology," Recent studies have implicated the hormone leptin in synaptic plasticity associated with neuronal development and learning and memory. Indeed, leptin facilitates hippocampal long-term potentiation and leptin-insensitive rodents display impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity suggesting a role for endogenous leptin. Structural changes are also thought to underlie activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and this may be regulated by specific growth factors. As leptin is reported to have neurotrophic actions, we have examined the effects of leptin on the morphology and filopodial outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. Here, we demonstrate that leptin rapidly enhances the motility and density of dendritic filopodia, and subsequently increases the density of hippocampal synapses. This process is dependent on the synaptic activation of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors and is mediated by the MAPK (ERK) signaling pathway. As dendritic morphogenesis is associated with activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength, the rapid structural remodeling of dendrites by leptin has important implications for its role in regulating hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neuronal development.

A new modeling approach using different diastole and systole zero-load geometries was introduced to handle the changing zero-load geometries for more accurate stress/strain calculations. Echo image data were acquired from 5 patients with infarction (Infarct Group) and 10 without (Non-Infarcted Group). Echo-based computational two-layer left ventricle models using one zero-load geometry (1G) and two zero-load geometries (2G) were constructed. Material parameter values in Mooney-Rivlin models were adjusted to match echo volume data. Effective Young‚Äôs moduli (YM) were calculated for easy comparison. For diastole phase, begin-filling (BF) mean YM value in the fiber direction (YM f ) was 738% higher than its end-diastole (ED) value (645.39 kPa vs. 76.97 kPa, p=3.38E-06). For systole phase, end-systole (ES) YM f was 903% higher than its begin-ejection (BE) value (1025.10 kPa vs. 102.11 kPa, p=6.10E-05). Comparing systolic and diastolic material properties, ES YM f was 59% higher than its BF value (1025.10 kPa vs. 645.39 kPa. p=0.0002). BE mean stress value was 514% higher than its ED value (299.69 kPa vs. 48.81 kPa, p=3.39E-06), while BE mean strain value was 31.5% higher than its ED value (0.9417 vs. 0.7162, p=0.004). Similarly, ES mean stress value was 562% higher than its BF value (19.74 kPa vs. 2.98 kPa, p=6.22E-05), and ES mean strain value was 264% higher than its BF value (0.1985 vs. 0.0546, p=3.42E-06). 2G models improved over 1G model limitations and may provide better material parameter estimation and stress/strain calculations.

0.459525369,18951449,Assessment of Functional Effects of Unclassified Genetic Variants," Inherited predisposition to disease is often linked to reduced activity of a disease associated gene product. Thus, quantitation of the influence of inherited variants on gene function can potentially be used to predict the disease relevance of these variants. While many disease genes have been extensively characterized at the functional level, few assays based on functional properties of the encoded proteins have been established for the purpose of predicting the contribution of rare inherited variants to disease. Much of the difficulty in establishing predictive functional assays stems from the technical complexity of the assays. However, perhaps the most challenging aspect of functional assay development for clinical testing purposes is the absolute requirement for validation of the sensitivity and specificity of the assays and the determination of positive predictive and negative predictive values of the assays relative to a ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù measure of disease predisposition. In this commentary we provide examples of some of the functional assays under development for several cancer predisposition genes [ BRCA1, BRCA2 , CDKN2A, and mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , and PMS2 ] and present a detailed review of the issues associated with functional assay development. We conclude that validation is paramount for all assays that will be used for clinical interpretation of inherited variants of any gene, but note that in certain circumstances information derived from incompletely validated assays may be valuable for classification of variants for clinical purposes when used to supplement data derived from other sources.

0.00135529,24997479,In vivo  degradation of 14C-labeled porcine dermis biologic scaffold," Biologic scaffold materials are used for repair and reconstruction of injured or missing tissues. Such materials are often composed of allogeneic or xenogeneic extracellular matrix (ECM) manufactured by decellularization of source tissue, such as dermis. Dermal ECM (D-ECM) has been observed to degrade and remodel in vivo more slowly than other biologic scaffold materials, such as small intestinal submucosa (SIS-ECM). Histologic examination is a common method for evaluating material degradation, but it lacks sensitivity and is subject to observer bias. Utilization of 14 C-proline labeled ECM is a quantitative alternative for measuring degradation of ECM scaffolds. Using both methods, the amount of degradation of D-ECM and SIS-ECM was determined at 2, 4, and 24 weeks post-implantation in a rodent model. Results utilizing 14 C liquid scintillation counting (LSC) analysis showed distinct differences in degradation at the three time points. D-ECM material in situ stayed the same at 76% remaining from 2 to 4 weeks post-implantation, and then decreased to 44% remaining at 24 weeks. In the same time period, implanted SIS-ECM material decreased from 72% to 13% to 0%.

Previous evidence and current clinical guidelines tell us that, if a closed reduction of a dorsally displaced fracture is possible, Kirschner wires (K-wires) are the preferred form of surgical fixation. However, the question remains whether there is any need to perform surgical fixation following a successful closed reduction, or is a simple plaster cast as effective? This is the protocol for a randomised controlled trial of manipulation and surgical fixation with K-wires versus manipulation and casting in the treatment of dorsally displaced distal radius fractures. Methods and analysis Adult patients with an acute dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius are potentially eligible to take part.

We used data for the Red Siskin ( Spinus cucullatus ), a critically endangered bird and ground truthing to examine anthropogenic habitat change as a source of SDM inaccuracy. We aimed to estimate: (1) the Red Siskin's historic distribution in Venezuela; (2) the portion of this historic distribution lost to vegetation degradation; and (3) the location of key habitats or areas with both, a high probability of historic occurrence and a low probability of vegetation degradation. We ground‚Äêtruthed 191 locations and used expert opinion as well as landscape characteristics to classify species' habitat suitability as excellent, good, acceptable, or poor. We fit a Random Forest model ( RF ) and Enhanced Vegetation Index ( EVI ) time series to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the expert categorization of habitat suitability. We estimated the probability of historic occurrence by fitting a MaxLike model using 88 presence records (1960‚Äì2013) and data on forest cover and aridity index. Of the entire study area, 23% (20,696¬†km 2 ) had a historic probability of Red Siskin occurrence over 0.743.

0.25616415,17356686,Imitating expressions: emotion-specific neural substrates in facial mimicry," Intentionally adopting a discrete emotional facial expression can modulate the subjective feelings corresponding to that emotion; however, the underlying neural mechanism is poorly understood. We therefore used functional brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to examine brain activity during intentional mimicry of emotional and non-emotional facial expressions and relate regional responses to the magnitude of expression-induced facial movement. Eighteen healthy subjects were scanned while imitating video clips depicting three emotional (sad, angry, happy), and two ‚Äòingestive‚Äô (chewing and licking) facial expressions. Simultaneously, facial movement was monitored from displacement of fiducial markers (highly reflective dots) on each subject‚Äôs face. Imitating emotional expressions enhanced activity within right inferior prefrontal cortex. This pattern was absent during passive viewing conditions. Moreover, the magnitude of facial movement during emotion-imitation predicted responses within right insula and motor/premotor cortices. Enhanced activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and frontal pole was observed during imitation of anger, in ventromedial prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate during imitation of sadness and in striatal, amygdala and occipitotemporal during imitation of happiness. Our findings suggest a central role for right inferior frontal gyrus in the intentional imitation of emotional expressions. Further, by entering metrics for facial muscular change into analysis of brain imaging data, we highlight shared and discrete neural substrates supporting affective, action and social consequences of somatomotor emotional expression.

0.033577725,29659607,Phenotypic plasticity of pre-adult egg maturation in a parasitoid: Effects of host-starvation and brood size,"Larvae of parasitoid wasps develop on a single arthropod host, and often face resource limitation that induces a tradeoff between egg maturation and somatic growth. Part of the variation in the growth-reproduction allocation was shown to be heritable, but how the larval developmental environment affects this allocation is not well-known. Detection of life history tradeoffs is often facilitated under stress conditions. We therefore exposed developing female larvae of the polyembryonic parasitoid Copidosoma koehleri (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) to laboratory manipulations aimed to restrict host resources (either host-starvation or high larval density). We compared the females‚Äô body sizes and egg loads shortly after adult emergence (<24 h) to those of closely related control females, which developed at a lower larval density within non-starved hosts. Host-starvation reduced the females‚Äô body sizes but not their initial egg loads. Females that experienced high larval density produced more eggs but were similar in body size to the low-density controls. Thus, the relative allocation to reproduction increased in response to both manipulations of host condition. Developmental duration and longevity were similar in all treatments. The negative correlation between body size and reproductive allocation, observed in the host-starvation treatment, is compatible with previous evidence from other parasitoids. In the high larval density treatment, however, reproductive allocation increased while body size was maintained, suggesting that the higher density increased rather than limited host resources per developing parasitoid female. The additional host resources that were diverted into egg production possibly resulted from increased feeding and body mass gain by hosts parasitized by large broods of wasps. Our results demonstrate phenotypic plasticity in resource allocation between growth and reproduction in a developing parasitoid. This plasticity may contribute to an adaptive balance between longevity and mobility vs. fecundity during the adult stage.",PloS one,ANIMAL
0.891203259,24516368,Gust Mitigation of Micro Air Vehicles Using Passive Articulated Wings,"Birds and insects naturally use passive flexing of their wings to augment their stability in uncertain aerodynamic environments.

The result is a class of articulated micro air vehicles where artificial passive joints are designed into the lifting surfaces. In order to analyze how passive articulation affects performance of micro air vehicles in gusty environments, an efficient 8 degree-of-freedom model is developed. Experimental validation of the proposed mathematical model was accomplished using flight test data of an articulated micro air vehicle obtained from a high resolution indoor tracking facility. Analytical investigation of the gust alleviation properties of the articulated micro air vehicle model was carried out using simulations with varying crosswind gust magnitudes. Simulations show that passive articulation in micro air vehicles can increase their robustness to gusts within a range of joint compliance. It is also shown that if articulation joints are made too compliant that gust mitigation performance is degraded when compared to a rigid system.",TheScientificWorldJournal,ENG

We used microbial community profiling (terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism, T-RFLP) and clone library sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to compare the diversity and community structure of dominant archaeal and bacterial communities associating with the mucus of three common reef-building coral species ( Porites astreoides , Siderastrea siderea and Orbicella annularis ) over different spatial scales on a Caribbean fringing reef. Sampling locations included three reef sites, three reef patches within each site and two depths. Reference sediment samples and ambient water were also taken for each of the 18 sampling locations resulting in a total of 239 samples. While only 41% of the bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) characterized by T-RFLP were shared between mucus and the ambient water or sediment, for archaeal OTUs this percentage was 2-fold higher (78%). About half of the mucus-associated OTUs (44% and 58% of bacterial and archaeal OTUs, respectively) were shared between the three coral species. Our multivariate statistical analysis (ANOSIM, PERMANOVA and CCA) showed that while the bacterial community composition was determined by habitat (mucus, sediment or seawater), host coral species, location and spatial distance, the archaeal community composition was solely determined by the habitat. This study highlights that mucus-associated archaeal and bacterial communities differ in their degree of community turnover over reefs and in their host-specificity.",PloS one,ANIMAL
0.332329304,30541027,A robust pipeline with high replication rate for detection of somatic variants in the adaptive immune system as a source of common genetic variation in autoimmune disease,"Abstract The role of somatic variants in diseases beyond cancer is increasingly being recognized, with potential roles in autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, as mutation rates and allele fractions are lower, studies in these diseases are substantially less tolerant of false positives, and bio-informatics algorithms require high replication rates. We developed a pipeline combining two variant callers, MuTect2 and VarScan2, with technical filtering and prioritization. Our pipeline detects somatic variants with allele fractions as low as 0.5% and achieves a replication rate of >55%. Validation in an independent data set demonstrates excellent performance (sensitivity¬†>¬†57%, specificity¬†>¬†98%, replication rate¬†>¬†80%). We applied this pipeline to the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS) as a proof-of-principle. We demonstrate that 60% of MS patients carry 2‚Äì10 exonic somatic variants in their peripheral blood T and B cells, with the vast majority (80%) occurring in T cells and variants persisting over time. Synonymous variants significantly co-occur with non-synonymous variants. Systematic characterization indicates somatic variants are enriched for being novel or very rare in public databases of germline variants and trend towards being more damaging and conserved, as reflected by higher phred-scaled combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) and genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) scores. Our pipeline and proof-of-principle now warrant further investigation of common somatic genetic variation on top of inherited genetic variation in the context of autoimmune disease, where it may offer subtle survival advantages to immune cells and contribute to the capacity of these cells to participate in the autoimmune reaction.",Human molecular genetics,POPGENE
0.918864261,26082887,The feasibility of white matter volume reduction analysis using SPM8 plus DARTEL for the diagnosis of patients with clinically diagnosed corticobasal syndrome and Richardson‚Äôs syndrome,"Purpose Diagnosing corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is often difficult due to the wide variety of symptoms and overlaps in the similar clinical courses and neurological findings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of white matter (WM) atrophy for the diagnosis of patients with clinically diagnosed CBD (corticobasal syndrome, CBS) and PSP (Richardson‚Äôs syndrome, RS). Methods We randomly divided the 3D T1-weighted MR images of 18 CBS patients, 33 RS patients, and 32 age-matched controls into two groups. We obtained segmented WM images in the first group using Voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (VSRAD) based on statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 8 plus diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated Lie algebra. A target volume of interest (VOI) for disease-specific atrophy was subsequently determined in this group using SPM8 group analyses of WM atrophy between patients groups and controls. We then evaluated the utility of these VOIs for diagnosing CBS and RS patients in the second group. Z score values in these VOIs were used as the determinant in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Results Specific target VOIs were determined in the bilateral frontal subcortical WM for CBS and in the midbrain tegmentum for RS. In ROC analyses, the target VOIs of CBS and RS compared to those of controls exhibited an area under curve (AUC) of 0.99 and 0.84, respectively, which indicated an adequate diagnostic power. The VOI of CBS revealed a higher AUC than that of RS for differentiating between CBS and RS (AUC, 0.75 vs 0.53). Conclusions Bilateral frontal WM volume reduction demonstrated a higher power for differentiating CBS from RS. This VOI analysis is useful for clinically diagnosing CBS and RS.

NPs find applications in numerous products and agriculture sector, and gaining importance in recent years. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were biosynthesized from silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) by green synthesis approach using Aloe vera extract. Mustard ( Brassica sp.) seedlings were grown hydroponically and toxicity of both AgNP and AgNO 3 (as ionic Ag + ) was assessed at various concentrations (1 and 3 mM) by analyzing shoot and root length, fresh mass, protein content, photosynthetic pigments and performance, cell viability, oxidative damage, DNA degradation and enzyme activities. The results revealed that both AgNPs and AgNO 3 declined growth of Brassica seedlings due to enhanced accumulation of AgNPs and AgNO 3 that subsequently caused severe inhibition in photosynthesis. Further, the results showed that both AgNPs and AgNO 3 induced oxidative stress as indicated by histochemical staining of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide that was manifested in terms of DNA degradation and cell death. Activities of antioxidants, i.e., ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT) were inhibited by AgNPs and AgNO 3. Interestingly, damaging impact of AgNPs was lesser than AgNO 3 on Brassica seedlings which was due to lesser accumulation of AgNPs and better activities of APX and CAT, which resulted in lesser oxidative stress, DNA degradation and cell death. The results of the present study showed differential impact of AgNPs and AgNO 3 on Brassica seedlings, their mode of action, and reasons for their differential impact. The results of the present study could be implied in toxicological research for designing strategies to reduce adverse impact of AgNPs and AgNO 3 on crop plants.",Frontiers in plant science,ANIMAL
0.669275896,23727009,Olfactory Bulb Monoamine Concentrations Vary with Time of Day," The olfactory bulb (OB) has been recently identified as a circadian oscillator capable of operating independently of the master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. OB oscillations manifest as rhythms in clock genes, electrical activity, and odor sensitivity. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin have been shown to modulate olfactory information processing by the OB and may be part of the mechanism that underlies diurnal changes in olfactory sensitivity. Rhythmic release of these neurotransmitters could generate OB rhythms in electrical activity and olfactory sensitivity. We hypothesized that these monoamines were rhythmically released in the OB. To test our hypotheses, we examined monoamine levels in the OB, over the course of a day, by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection. We observed that dopamine and its metabolite, DOPAC, rhythmically fluctuate over the day. In contrast, norepinephrine is arrhythmic. Serotonin and its metabolite HIAA appear to rhythmically fluctuate. Each of these monoamines has been shown to alter OB circuit behavior and influence odor processing. Rhythmic release of serotonin may be a mechanism by which the suprachiasmatic nuclei communicate, indirectly, with the OB. ",Neuroscience,NEURO

The prevalence of ASD in many South Asian countries is still unknown. The aim of this study was to systematically review available epidemiological studies of ASD in this region to identify gaps in our current knowledge. Methods We searched, collected and evaluated articles published between January 1962 and July 2016 which reported the prevalence of ASD in eight South Asian countries. The search was conducted in line with the PRISMA guidelines. Results We identified six articles from Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka which met our predefined inclusion criteria. The reported prevalence of ASD in South Asia ranged from 0.09% in India to 1.07% in Sri Lanka that indicates up to one in 93 children have ASD in this region. Alarmingly high prevalence (3%) was reported in Dhaka city. Study sample sizes ranged from 374 in Sri Lanka to 18,480 in India. The age range varied between 1 and 30¬†years. No studies were found which reported the prevalence of ASD in Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Afghanistan. This review identifies methodological differences in case definition, screening instruments and diagnostic criteria among reported three countries which make it very difficult to compare the studies. Conclusions Our study is an attempt at understanding the scale of the problem and scarcity of information regarding ASD in the South Asia. This study will contribute to the evidence base needed to design further research and make policy decisions on addressing this issue in this region.

0.072721378,29693672,‚ÄúDip-and-read‚Äù paper-based analytical devices using distance-based detection with color screening," An improved paper-based analytical device (PAD) using color screening to enhance device performance is described. Current detection methods for PADs relying on the distance-based signalling motif can be slow due to the assay time being limited by capillary flow rates that wick fluid through the detection zone. For traditional distance-based detection motifs, analysis can take up to 45 min for a channel length of 5 cm. By using a color screening method, quantitation using distance-based PAD can be achieved in minutes using a ‚Äúdip-and-read‚Äù approach. A colorimetric indicator line deposited onto a paper substrate using inkjet-printing undergoes a concentration-dependent colorimetric response for a given analyte. This color intensity-based response has been converted to a distance-based signal by overlaying a color filter with a continuous color intensity gradient matching the color of the developed indicator line. As a proof-of-concept, Ni quantification in welding fume was performed as a model assay. The results of multiple independent user testing gave the mean absolute percentage error and average relative standard deviations of 10.5% and 11.2% respectively, which were an improvement upon analysis based on simple visual color comparison with a read guide (12.2%, 14.9%). In addition to the analytical performance comparison, an interference study and a shelf life investigation were performed to further demonstrate practical utility. The developed system demonstrates an alternative detection approach for distance-based PADs enabling fast (~ 10 min), quantitative, and straightforward assays. ",Lab on a chip,ENG

This work aims to investigate the relationship between the cooling rate and morphology of TiAl 3 . The microstructure and composition of master alloys at different cooling rates were characterized and analyzed by optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and SEM with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The results showed that various morphologies of TiAl 3 particles in the Al‚Äì4Ti master alloy could be acquired at different cooling rates. Petal-like, blocky, and flake-like TiAl 3 particles in the Al‚Äì4Ti master alloy were respectively acquired at the cooling rates of 3.36 K/s, 2.57 K/s, and 0.31 K/s. It was also found that the morphology of TiAl 3 particles in the prepared master alloy changed from petal-like to blocky, then finally to flake-like, with the decrease of cooling rate. In addition, the morphology of the TiAl 3 particles has no effect on the phase inversion temperature of Al‚Äì4Ti master alloy.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",CHEM

0.495347725,28793484,Study on Welding Mechanism Based on Modification of Polypropylene for Improving the Laser Transmission Weldability to PA66,"Polypropylene and PA66 are widely used in our daily life, but they cannot be welded by laser transmission welding (LTW) because of polar differences and poor compatibility. In this paper, grafting modification technology is used to improve the welding performance between polypropylene and PA66. Firstly, the strong reactive and polar maleic-anhydride (MAH) is grafted to polypropylene and infrared spectrometer is used to prove that MAH has been grafted to polypropylene. At the same time, the mechanical and thermal properties of the graft modified polypropylene (TGMPP) are tested. The results prove that the grafting modification has little influence on them. Also, the optical properties of TGMPP are measured. Then, the high welding strength between TGMPP and PA66 is found and the mechanism of the weldability is researched, which shows that there are two reasons for the high welding strength. By observing the micro morphology of the welding zone, one reason found is that the modification of polypropylene can improve the compatibility between polypropylene and PA66 and make them easy to diffuse mutually, which causes many locking structures formed in the welding region. The other reason is that there are chemical reactions between TGMPP and PA66 proved by the X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",CHEM
0.619707846,24839400,"Estimating the cost-effectiveness of nutrition supplementation for malnourished, HIV-infected adults starting antiretroviral therapy in a resource-constrained setting","Background Low body mass index (BMI) individuals starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa have high rates of death and loss to follow-up in the first 6 months of treatment. Nutritional supplementation may improve health outcomes in this population, but the anticipated benefit of any intervention should be commensurate with the cost given resource limitations and the need to expand access to ART in the region. Methods We used Markov models incorporating historical data and program-wide estimates of treatment costs and health benefits from the Zambian national ART program to estimate the improvements in 6-month survival and program retention among malnourished adults necessary for a combined nutrition support and ART treatment program to maintain cost-effectiveness parity with ART treatment alone. Patients were stratified according to World Health Organization criteria for severe (BMI <16.0 kg/m 2 ), moderate (16.00-16.99 kg/m 2 ), and mild (17.00-18.49 kg/m 2 ) malnutrition categories. Results 19,247 patients contributed data between May 2004 and October 2010. Quarterly survival and retention were lowest in the BMI <16.0 kg/m 2 category compared to higher BMI levels, and there was less variation in both measures across BMI strata after 180 days. ART treatment was estimated to cost $556 per year and averted 7.3 disability-adjusted life years. To maintain cost-effectiveness parity with ART alone, a supplement needed to cost $10.99 per quarter and confer a 20% reduction in both 6-month mortality and loss to follow-up among BMI <16.0 kg/m 2 patients. Among BMI 17.00-18.49 kg/m 2 patients, supplement costs accompanying a 20% reduction in mortality and loss to follow-up could not exceed $5.18 per quarter. In sensitivity analyses, the maximum permitted supplement cost increased if the ART program cost rose, and fell if patients classified as lost to follow-up at 6 months subsequently returned to care. Conclusions Low BMI adults starting ART in sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk of early mortality and loss to follow-up. The expense of providing nutrition supplementation would require only modest improvements in survival and program retention to be cost-effective for the most severely malnourished individuals starting ART, but interventions are unlikely to be cost-effective among those in higher BMI strata.",Cost effectiveness and resource allocation : C/E,EPIDEM

Total number of differences in genetic variants between 96,464 human pairs has been calculated. The distributions of these differences for individuals within European, Asian, or African origin were characterized by narrow unimodal peaks with mean values of 3.8, 3.5, and 5.1 million, respectively, and standard deviations of 0.1‚Äì0.03 million. The total numbers of genomic differences between pairs of all known relatives were found to be significantly lower than their respective population means and in reverse proportion to the distance of their consanguinity. By counting the total number of genomic differences it is possible to infer familial relations for people that share down to 6% of common loci identical-by-descent. Detection of familial relations can be radically improved when only very rare genetic variants are taken into account. Counting of total number of shared very rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from whole-genome sequences allows establishing distant familial relations for persons with eighth and ninth degrees of relationship. Using this analysis we predicted 271 distant familial pairwise relations among 1,092 individuals that have not been declared by 1000 Genomes Project. Particularly, among 89 British and 97 Chinese individuals we found three British‚ÄìChinese pairs with distant genetic relationships. Individuals from these pairs share identical-by-descent DNA fragments that represent 0.001%, 0.004%, and 0.01% of their genomes. With affordable whole-genome sequencing techniques, very rare SNPs should become important genetic markers for familial relationships and population stratification.",Genome biology and evolution,POPGENE
0.484835765,29650019,The effect of North Carolina free clinics on hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions among the uninsured,"Background Free clinics are volunteer based organizations that provide health care services to low-income individuals for free or minimal cost. Communities served by a free clinic can provide ambulatory care services for uninsured individuals, reducing reliance on costly hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. This study examines whether free clinics in North Carolina reduce hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions for uninsured adults. Methods The study used North Carolina hospital discharge data from 2003 to 2007, restricted to uninsured adults residing in North Carolina ( N =‚Äâ270,325). Prevention Quality Indicators identified hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. The entry of new free clinics in some counties during this time period in conjunction with county-level and year fixed effects allows the logistic regression analysis to simulate a pre/post study design. Results Discharges for ambulatory care sensitive conditions constituted 12.6% of the sample. Despite the limited coverage provided by free clinics, which serve 5.5% of the uninsured in North Carolina, uninsured adults in counties served by a free clinic had an 8.0% reduced odds of a hospitalization being for an ambulatory care sensitive condition. When the model is limited to ambulatory care sensitive conditions related to chronic conditions, the odds of a hospitalization of an uninsured adult for an ambulatory care sensitive condition in counties served by a free clinic is reduced by 9.0%. Conclusion Free clinics are effective providers of primary care services for uninsured individuals, particularly for those with chronic conditions. To enhance this impact by increasing free clinics‚Äô reach, state and local policy makers should support and encourage development of free clinics in high need areas.

0.651779589,23197413,Losing sight of the future: Impaired semantic prospection following medial temporal lobe lesions," The ability to imagine the future (prospection) relies on many of the same brain regions that support memory for the past. To date, scientific research has primarily focused on the neural substrates of episodic forms of prospection (mental simulation of spatiotemporally specific future events) whereas little is known about the neural substrates of semantic prospection (mental simulation of future nonpersonal facts). Of particular interest is the role of the medial temporal lobes, and specifically the hippocampus. While the hippocampus has been proposed to play a key role in episodic prospection, recent evidence suggests that it may not play a similar role in semantic prospection. To examine this possibility, amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions were asked to imagine future issues occurring in the public domain. The results showed that patients could list general semantic facts about the future, but when probed to elaborate, patients produced impoverished descriptions that lacked semantic detail. This impairment occurred despite intact performance on standard neuropsychological tests of semantic processing, and did not simply reflect deficits in narrative construction. The performance of a patient with damage limited to the hippocampus was similar to that of the remaining MTL patients and amnesic patients‚Äô impaired elaboration of the semantic future correlated with their impaired elaboration of the semantic past. Together, these results provide novel evidence from MTL amnesia that memory and prospection are linked in the semantic domain and reveal that the medial temporal lobes play a critical role in the construction of detailed, multi-element semantic simulations.

0.688962326,24954713,Prefrontal cortical recordings with biomorphic MEAs reveal complex columnar-laminar microcircuits for BCI/BMI implementation," The mammalian prefrontal cortex known as the seat of high brain functions uses a six layer distribution of minicolumnar neurons to coordinate the integration of sensory information and the selection of relevant signals for goal driven behavior. To reveal the complex functionality of these columnar microcircuits we employed simultaneous recordings with several configurations of biomorphic microelectrode arrays (MEAs) within cortical layers in adjacent minicolumns, in four nohuman primates (NHPs) performing a delayed match-to-sample (DMS) visual discrimination task. We examined: 1) the functionality of inter-laminar, and inter-columnar interactions between pairs of cells in the same or different minicolumns by use of normalized cross-correlation histograms (CCH), 2) the modulation of Glutamate concentration in layer 2/3, and 3) the potential interactions within these microcircuits. The results demonstrate that neurons in both infra-granular and supra-granular layers interact through inter-laminar loops, as well as through intra-laminar to produce behavioral response signals. These results provide new insights into the manner in which prefrontal cortical microcircuitry integrates sensory stimuli used to provide behaviorally relevant signals that may be implemented in brain computer/machine interfaces (BCI/BMIs) during performance of the task.

In this study, we describe the individual subject variability in probe-mediated texture perception, and compare similarities and differences of texture perception between direct touch and indirect touch. The results show variability among subjects, as individual subjects may choose to rely on different degrees of three texture dimensions and do so at different scanning velocities. Despite this variability between scanning conditions within each subject, the subjects make consistently reliable discriminations of textures and subjective magnitude estimates along texture continua when indirectly exploring texture surfaces with a probe.

0.870054303,21228169,Phase advancement and nucleus-specific timing of thalamocortical activity during slow cortical oscillation," The exact timing of cortical afferent activity is instrumental for the correct coding and retrieval of internal and external stimuli. Thalamocortical inputs represent the most significant subcortical pathway to the cortex, but the precise timing and temporal variability of thalamocortical activity is not known. To examine this question, we studied the phase of thalamic action potentials relative to cortical oscillations and established correlations among phase, the nuclear location of the thalamocortical neurons and the frequency of cortical activity.  The phase of thalamic action potentials depended on the exact frequency of the slow cortical oscillation both on long (minutes) and short (single wave) time scales. Faster waves were accompanied by phase advancement in both cases. Thalamocortical neurons located in different nuclei fired at significantly different phases of the slow waves but were active at similar phase of spindle oscillations. Different thalamic nuclei displayed distinct burst patterns. Bursts with higher number of action potentials displayed progressive phase advancement in a nucleus-specific manner. Thalamic neurons located along nuclear borders were characterized by mixed burst and phase properties.  Our data demonstrate that the temporal relationship between cortical and thalamic activity is not fixed but displays dynamic changes during oscillatory activity. The timing depends on the precise location and exact activity of thalamocortical cells and the ongoing cortical network pattern. This variability of thalamic output and its coupling to cortical activity can enable thalamocortical neurons to actively participate in the coding and retrieval of complex cortical signals.

0.330555442,23550141,Involvement of MLPK Pathway in Intraspecies Unilateral Incompatibility Regulated by a Single Locus With Stigma and Pollen Factors,"Plants have evolved many systems to prevent undesirable fertilization. Among these, incompatibility is a well-organized system in which pollen germination or pollen tube growth is inhibited in pistils. We previously found that a novel one-way pollen‚Äìstigma incompatibility response [unilateral incompatibility (UI)] occurred between two self-incompatible Brassica rapa plants, a Turkish line, and a Japanese cultivated hybrid variety, ‚ÄúOsome.‚Äù Pollen from the Turkish line is rejected on the stigma of the Osome line, but the reverse cross is compatible; such a UI phenotype closely resembles self-incompatibility (SI). The pollen factor of this UI has been genetically explained by a single locus which is different from the S -locus. In this study, we performed further genetic analyses of this intraspecies UI and showed that the stigma factor was also controlled by a single locus, and we named the loci corresponding to the stigma and pollen factors of the intraspecies UI, stigmatic unilateral incompatibility ( SUI ), and pollen unilateral incompatibility ( PUI ) loci, respectively. Interestingly, segregation analyses of SUI and PUI indicated that they are closely linked to each other and behave as a single unit. To investigate the effect of an SI-related gene, MLPK in this UI, we produced segregation lines for SUI and mlpk . A distorted segregation ratio of SUI phenotype in an mlpk background indicated involvement of MLPK in SUI, suggesting the existence of an MLPK-dependent novel pollen‚Äìstigma recognition mechanism.","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",ANIMAL

Often, thermal fluctuations, modelled as stochastic noise, are present in the system and the phase segregation process occurs on a surface. In this work, the segregation process is modelled via the Cahn‚ÄìHilliard‚ÄìCook model, which is a fourth-order parabolic stochastic system. Coarsening is analysed on two sample surfaces: a unit sphere and a dumbbell. On both surfaces, a statistical analysis of the growth rate is performed, and the influence of noise level and mobility is also investigated. For the spherical interface, it is also shown that a lognormal distribution fits the growth rate well.",Royal Society open science,CS

This indicates that less commonly measured functional traits may more clearly elucidate trait‚Äìperformance relationships. Despite the potential importance of leaf vein traits, which are expected to be related to resource delivery rates and photosynthetic capacity, there are few studies, which examine associations between these traits and demographic performance in communities. Here, we examined the associations between species traits including leaf venation traits and demographic rates (Relative Growth Rate, RGR and mortality) as well as the spatial distributions of traits along soil environment for 54 co‚Äêoccurring species in a subtropical forest. Size‚Äêrelated changes in demographic rates were estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. Next, Kendall's rank correlations were quantified between traits and estimated demographic rates at a given size and between traits and species‚Äêaverage soil environment. Species with denser venation, smaller areoles, less succulent, or thinner leaves showed higher RGR for a wide range of size classes. Species with leaves of denser veins, larger area, cheaper construction costs or thinner, or low‚Äêdensity wood were associated with high mortality rates only in small size classes. Lastly, contrary to our expectations, acquisitive traits were not related to resource‚Äêrich edaphic conditions. This study shows that leaf vein traits are weakly, but significantly related to tree demographic performance together with other species traits. Because leaf traits associated with an acquisitive strategy such as denser venation, less succulence, and thinner leaves showed higher growth rate, but similar leaf traits were not associated with mortality, different pathways may shape species growth and survival. This study suggests that we are still not measuring some of key traits related to resource‚Äêuse strategies, which dictate the demography and distributions of species.",Ecology and evolution,ECO

In women of Ashkenazi Jewish ascendance, up to 30% of breast and ovarian carcinomas may be attributable to mutations in these genes, where 3 founder mutations, c.68_69del (185delAG) and c.5266dup (5382insC) in BRCA1 and c.5946del (6174delT) in BRCA2 , are commonly encountered. It has been suggested by some authors that screening for founder mutations should be undertaken in all Brazilian women with breast cancer. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of three founder mutations, commonly identified in Ashkenazi individuals in a sample of non-Ashkenazi cancer-affected Brazilian women with clearly defined risk factors for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Among 137 unrelated Brazilian women from HBOC families, the BRCA1 c.5266dup mutation was identified in seven individuals (5%). This prevalence is similar to that encountered in non-Ashkenazi HBOC families in other populations. However, among patients with bilateral breast cancer, the frequency of c.5266dup was significantly higher when compared to patients with unilateral breast tumors (12.1% vs 1.2%, p = 0.023). The BRCA1 c.68_69del and BRCA2 c.5946del mutations did not occur in this sample. We conclude that screening non-Ashkenazi breast cancer-affected women from the ethnically heterogeneous Brazilian populations for the BRCA1 c.68_69del and BRCA2 c.5946del is not justified, and that screening for BRCA1 c.5266dup should be considered in high risk patients, given its prevalence as a single mutation. In high-risk patients, a negative screening result should always be followed by comprehensive BRCA gene testing. The finding of a significantly higher frequency of BRCA1 c.5266dup in women with bilateral breast cancer, as well as existence of other as yet unidentified founder mutations in this population, should be further assessed in a larger well characterized high-risk cohort.",Hereditary cancer in clinical practice,POPGENE

Given the potential benefits of the dengue vaccines and the need for copayment by the private sector, this study aims to evaluate the willingness to pay (WTP) for the dengue vaccines in patients with DF in Northern Vietnam. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 330 in-and-out patients with DF admitted to the Bach Mai Hospital. We used the contingent valuation method to evaluate the WTP for dengue vaccines. Socioeconomic and clinical characteristics were also investigated. Multivariate interval and logistic regression models were used to estimate the average amount of WTP and identify the factors associated with the WTP. Results Around 77.3% patients were willing to pay an average amount of US$ 67.4 (95% CI=57.4‚Äì77.4) for the vaccine. People of higher ages, those having health insurance, those traveling in the past 15 days or suffering from anxiety/depression were less likely to be willing to pay for the dengue vaccine. However, people having a longer duration of DF or having problems with mobility were positively associated with WTP for the dengue vaccine. Patients educated to more than high school levels (Coeff.=31.31; 95% CI=3.26‚Äì59.35), those in the richest quintile (Coeff.=62.76; 95% CI=25.40; 100.13), or those having a longer duration of the disease (Coeff.=6.18; 95% CI=0.72‚Äì11.63) were willing to pay a higher amount. Conclusion This study highlights a relatively high rate and amount of WTP for the dengue vaccine among patients with DF. Psychological counseling services as well as educational campaigns should be undertaken to improve the WTP for the vaccine. Moreover, government subsidies should be given to increase the coverage of the vaccine in the future, especially for the poor.",Patient preference and adherence,EPIDEM

Methods  We develop a general computational approach along with an efficient estimation procedure in the widely used generalized linear model (GLM) framework to characterize such nonstationary dynamics in spiking response and spatiotemporal characteristics of a neuron at the level of individual trials. The model employs a set of modulatory components, which nonlinearly interact with other stimulus-related signals to reproduce such nonstationary effects.    Results  The model is tested for its ability to predict the responses of neurons in the middle temporal cortex of macaque monkeys during an eye movement task. The fitted model proves successful in capturing the fast temporal modulations in the response, reproducing the spike response temporal statistics, and accurately accounting for the neurons‚Äô dynamic spatiotemporal sensitivities, during eye movements.    Conclusion  The nonstationary GLM framework developed in this study can be used in cases where a time-varying behavioral or cognitive component makes GLM-based models insufficient to describe the dependencies of neural responses on the stimulus-related covariates.

As part of the U.S. Tox21 Phase I effort, we profiled the CYP activity of approximately three thousand compounds, primarily those of environmental concern, against human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 isoforms in a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) format. In order to evaluate the extent to which computational models built from a drug-like library screened in these five CYP assays under the same conditions can accurately predict the outcome of an environmental compound library, five support vector machines (SVM) models built from over 17,000 drug-like compounds were challenged to predict the CYP activities of the Tox21 compound collection. Although a large fraction of the test compounds fall outside of the applicability domain (AD) of the models, as measured by k -nearest neighbor ( k -NN) similarities, the predictions were largely accurate for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 ioszymes with area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC-ROC) ranging between 0.82 and 0.84. The lower predictive power of the CYP2C19 model (AUC-ROC = 0.76) is caused by experimental errors and that of the CYP2D6 model (AUC-ROC = 0.76) can be rescued by rebalancing the training data. Our results demonstrate that decomposing molecules into atom types enhanced the coverage of the AD and that computational models built from drug-like molecules can be used to predict the ability of non-drug like compounds to interact with these CYPs.

Participants viewed photographs of faces whose gaze was directed ahead, to the left or to the right. Target letters then appeared unpredictably to the left or right. As expected, targets in the location indicated by gaze were detected more rapidly. In nonanxious volunteers the effects of fearful gaze did not differ from neutral gaze, but fearful expression had a more powerful influence in a selected high anxious group. Attention is thus more likely to be guided by the direction of fearful than neutral gaze, but only in anxiety-prone individuals. ",Visual cognition,PSYCH
0.377227331,28213947,Select noxious stimuli induce changes on corneal nerve morphology," The surface of the cornea contains the highest density of nociceptive nerves of any tissue in the body. These nerves are responsive to a variety of modalities of noxious stimuli and can signal pain even when activated by low threshold stimulation. Injury of corneal nerves can lead to altered nerve morphology, including neuropathic changes which can be associated with chronic pain. Emerging technologies that allow imaging of corneal nerves in vivo are spawning questions regarding the relationship between corneal nerve density, morphology and function. We tested whether noxious stimulation of the corneal surface can alter nerve morphology and neurochemistry. We used concentrations of menthol, capsaicin, and hypertonic saline that evoked comparable levels of nocifensive eye wipe behaviors when applied to the ocular surface of an awake rat. Animals were sacrificed and corneal nerves were examined using immunocytochemistry and three-dimensional volumetric analyses. We found that menthol and capsaicin both caused a significant reduction in corneal nerve density as detected with Œ≤-tubulin immunoreactivity two hours after stimulation. Hypertonic saline did not reduce nerve density, but did cause qualitative changes in nerves including enlarged varicosities that were also seen following capsaicin and menthol stimulation. All three types of noxious stimuli caused a depletion of CGRP from corneal nerves, indicating that all modalities of noxious stimuli evoked peptide release. Our findings suggest that studies aimed at understanding the relationship between corneal nerve morphology and chronic disease may also need to consider the effects of acute stimulation on corneal nerve morphology.   Graphical Abstract  Using immunocytochemistry combined with confocal microscopy and advanced imaging techniques, the authors show that a single topical application of noxious stimuli to the cornea affects corneal nerve morphology and neuropeptide content. This study examines the vulnerability of these nerves to acute noxious stimulation that may have long term implications.    ",The Journal of comparative neurology,NEURO

Dynamic joint motion recording combined with CT-based 3D bone and joint surface data is accepted as a helpful and precise tool to analyse joint. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of these techniques for quantitative motion analysis of the interphalangeal joint in 3D. Materials and Method . High resolution motion data was combined with an accurate 3D model of a cadaveric index finger. Three light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used to record dynamic data, and a CT scan of the finger was done for 3D joint surface geometry. The data allowed performing quantitative evaluations such as finite helical axis (FHA) analysis, coordinate system optimization, and measurement of the joint distances in 3D. Results . The FHA varies by 4.9 ¬± 1.7¬∞ on average. On average, the rotation in adduction/abduction and internal/external rotation were 0.3 ¬± 0.91¬∞ and 0.1 ¬± 0.97¬∞, respectively. During flexion, a translational motion between 0.06‚Äâmm and 0.73‚Äâmm was observed. Conclusions .

0.432774583,23468175,Identification of genetic variation that determines human trehalase activity and its association with type 2 diabetes,"A prior linkage scan in Pima Indians identified a putative locus for type two diabetes (T2D) and body mass index (BMI) on chromosome 11q23-25. Association mapping across this region identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the trehalase gene ( TREH ) that were associated with T2D. To assess the putative connection between trehalase activity and T2D, we performed a linkage study for trehalase activity in 570 Pima Indians who had measures of trehalase activity. Strong evidence of linkage of plasma trehalase activity (LOD¬†=¬†7.0) was observed in the TREH locus. Four tag SNPs in TREH were genotyped in these subjects and plasma trehalase activity was highly associated with three SNPs: rs2276064, rs117619140 and rs558907 ( p =¬†2.2¬†√ó¬†10 ‚àí11 ‚Äì1.4¬†√ó¬†10 ‚àí23 ), and the fourth SNP, rs10790256, was associated conditionally on these three ( p =¬†2.9¬†√ó¬†10 ‚àí7 ). Together, the four tag SNPs explained 51¬†% of the variance in plasma trehalase activity and 79¬†% of the variance attributed to the linked locus. These four tag SNPs were further genotyped in 828 subjects used for association mapping of T2D, and rs558907 was associated with T2D (odds ratio (OR) 1.94, p =¬†0.002). To assess replication of the T2D association, all four tag SNPs were additionally genotyped in two non-overlapping samples of Native Americans. Rs558907 was reproducibly associated with T2D in 2,942 full-heritage Pima Indians (OR 1.27 p =¬†0.03) and 3,897 ‚Äúmixed‚Äù heritage Native Americans (OR 1.21, p =¬†0.03), and the strongest evidence for association came from combining all samples (OR 1.27 p =¬†1.6¬†√ó¬†10 ‚àí4 , n =¬†7,667). However, among 320 longitudinally studied subjects, measures of trehalase activity from a non-diabetic exam did not predict those who would eventually develop diabetes versus those who would remain non-diabetic (hazard ratio 0.94 per SD of trehalase activity, p =¬†0.29). We conclude that variants in TREH control trehalase activity, and although one of these variants is also reproducibly associated with T2D, it is likely that the effect of the SNP on risk of T2D occurs by a mechanism different than affecting trehalase activity. Alternatively, TREH variants may be tagging a nearby T2D locus.

Coupling with depolymerized lignin camelina protein exhibited increased hydrophobicity.

Recent advances in influenza surveillance in US swine populations allow for timely epidemiological, phylogenetic, and virological analyses that monitor emergence of novel viruses and assess changes in viral population dynamics. Methods To better understand IAV in the North American swine population, we undertook a phylogenetic analysis of 1075 HA , 1049 NA , and 1040 m sequences of IAV isolated from US swine during 2009‚Äì2012 through voluntary and anonymous submissions to the US Department of Agriculture IAV swine surveillance system. Results Analyses revealed changes in population dynamics among multiple clades of A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and A/H1N2 cocirculating in US swine populations during 2009‚Äì2012. Viral isolates were categorized into one of seven genetically and antigenically distinct hemagglutinin lineages: H1Œ±, H1Œ≤, H1Œ≥, H1Œ¥1, H1Œ¥2, H1pdm09, and H3 cluster IV . There was an increase in occurrence of H1Œ¥1 in samples submitted, with a concurrent decrease in H1pdm09. H3 cluster IV exhibited increasing diversification, warranting a re‚Äêevaluation of phylogenetic nomenclature criteria. Although H3N2 represented 25% of identified viruses, this subtype was reported in increasing proportion of sequenced isolates since late 2011. Conclusions Surveillance and reporting of IAV in US swine have increased since 2009, and we demonstrate a period of expanded viral diversity.

M√∂ssbauer and EPR studies have shown that the all-ferrous cluster has a ground state spin S = 4 and an effective 3:1 site symmetry in the spin structure and 57 Fe quadrupole interactions. Recently Deng and Holm reported the synthesis of [Fe 4 S 4 (Pr i 2 NHCMe 2 ) 4 ], 2  1 , (Pr i 2 NHCMe 2 = 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene) and showed that the all-ferrous carbene-coordinated cluster is amenable to physico‚Äìchemical studies. M√∂ssbauer and EPR studies of 1 , reported here, reveal that the electronic structure of this complex is strikingly similar to that of the protein-bound cluster, suggesting that the ground state spin and the 3:1 site ratio are consequences of spontaneous distortions of the cluster core. To gain insight into the origin of the peculiar ground state of the all-ferrous clusters in 1 and Av 2, we have studied a theoretical model that is based on a Heisenberg‚ÄìDirac‚ÄìVan Vleck Hamiltonian whose exchange-coupling constants are a function of the Fe‚ÄìFe distances. By combining the exchange energies with the elastic deformation energies in the harmonic approximation, we obtain for a T 2 distortion a minimum with spin S = 4 and a C 3v core structure in which one iron is unique and three irons are equivalent. This minimum has all the spectroscopic and structural characteristics of the all-ferrous clusters of 1 and Av 2.

0.835927824,27447730,Inference for Stochastic Chemical Kinetics Using Moment Equations and System Size Expansion,"Quantitative mechanistic models are valuable tools for disentangling biochemical pathways and for achieving a comprehensive understanding of biological systems. However, to be quantitative the parameters of these models have to be estimated from experimental data. In the presence of significant stochastic fluctuations this is a challenging task as stochastic simulations are usually too time-consuming and a macroscopic description using reaction rate equations (RREs) is no longer accurate. In this manuscript, we therefore consider moment-closure approximation (MA) and the system size expansion (SSE), which approximate the statistical moments of stochastic processes and tend to be more precise than macroscopic descriptions. We introduce gradient-based parameter optimization methods and uncertainty analysis methods for MA and SSE. Efficiency and reliability of the methods are assessed using simulation examples as well as by an application to data for Epo-induced JAK/STAT signaling. The application revealed that even if merely population-average data are available, MA and SSE improve parameter identifiability in comparison to RRE. Furthermore, the simulation examples revealed that the resulting estimates are more reliable for an intermediate volume regime. In this regime the estimation error is reduced and we propose methods to determine the regime boundaries. These results illustrate that inference using MA and SSE is feasible and possesses a high sensitivity. Author Summary In this manuscript, we introduce efficient methods for parameter estimation for stochastic processes. The stochasticity of chemical reactions can influence the average behavior of the considered system. For some biological systems, a microscopic, stochastic description is computationally intractable but a macroscopic, deterministic description too inaccurate. This inaccuracy manifests itself in an error in parameter estimates, which impede the predictive power of the proposed model. Until now, no rigorous analysis on the magnitude of the estimation error exists. We show by means of two simulation examples that using mesoscopic descriptions based on the system size expansions and moment-closure approximations can reduce this estimation error compared to inference using a macroscopic description. This reduction is most pronounced in an intermediate volume regime where the influence of stochasticity on the average behavior is moderately strong. For the JAK/STAT pathway where experimental data is available, we show that one parameter that was not structurally identifiable when using a macroscopic description becomes structurally identifiable when using a mesoscopic description for parameter estimation.",PLoS computational biology,CS

Methods Six hundred and twenty-one breast cancer patients were invited for a face-to-face interview in Qingdao Municipal Hospital, China. EQ-5D-5L was scored using tariffs from China, Japan, Korea, and the UK. The null hypothesis of normal distribution of the EQ-5D-5L utility score was tested by the Shapiro‚ÄìWilk test. Nonparametric Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to determine the difference among the four tariffs. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland‚ÄìAltman plots were used to study the agreement among the four EQ-5D-5L scores. Known-groups validity was studied using a regression framework. Results There were 608 participants in the final analysis, with a mean ¬± standard deviation (SD) age of 48.0¬±9.6 years. EQ-5D-5L utility scores were non-normally distributed. The means (median) ¬± SD of EQ-5D-5L utilities derived from Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and UK tariffs were 0.828 (0.879) ¬±0.184, 0.802 (0.823) ¬±0.164, 0.831 (0.829) ¬±0.137, and 0.838 (0.866) ¬±0.154, respectively. Among pairwise comparisons, the difference of median EQ-5D-5L utility scores was only insignificant between Chinese and UK tariffs. Excellent agreements (with ICCs >0.9) were found among the four tariffs albeit the limits of agreement between each pair of tariffs were wide. Known-groups validity was supported. Conclusion Although four country-specific EQ-5D-5L tariffs have shown an overall high level of correlation and agreement, none of them could be regarded as interchangeable. The higher correlation and agreement between Chinese and UK tariffs may be due to the similar functions that were used in the tariff development. In the absence of Chinese-specific tariff, the UK tariff is the second-best option to be applied in the Chinese population. Results of this study further contribute to the explanation of variations among country-specific tariffs.",Patient preference and adherence,EPIDEM

0.135999405,29028941,Dysregulation of Cortical Neuron DNA Methylation Profile in Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Abstract Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome whose etiology includes genetic and environmental components. Since epigenetic marks are sensitive to environmental insult, they may be involved in the development of ASD. Initial brain studies have suggested a dysregulation of epigenetic marks in ASD. However, due to cellular heterogeneity in the brain, these studies have not determined if there is a true change in the neuronal epigenetic signature. Here, we report a genome-wide methylation study on fluorescence-activated cell sorting-sorted neuronal nuclei from the frontal cortex of 16 male ASD and 15 male control subjects. Using the 450 K BeadArray, we identified 58 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that included loci associated to GABAergic system genes, particularly ABAT and GABBR1 , and brain-specific MicroRNAs. Selected DMRs were validated by targeted Next Generation Bisulfite Sequencing. Weighted gene correlation network analysis detected 3 co-methylation modules which are significantly correlated to ASD that were enriched for genomic regions underlying neuronal, GABAergic, and immune system genes.

0.997920561,27090442,Protection against  Schistosoma mansoni  infection using a  Fasciola hepatica -derived fatty acid binding protein from different delivery systems,"Background Schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease afflicting over 261 million people in many areas of the developing countries with high morbidity and mortality. The control relies mainly on treatment with praziquantel. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) have demonstrated high levels of immune-protection against trematode infections. This study reports the immunoprotection induced by cross-reacting Fasciola hepatica FABP, native (nFh12) and recombinantly expressed using two different expression systems Escherichia coli (rFh15) and baculovirus (rFh15b) against Schistosoma mansoni infection. Methods BALB/c mice were vaccinated with native nFh12 or recombinant rFh15 and rFh15 FABP from F. hepatica formulated in adjuvant adaptation (ADAD) system with natural or chemical synthesised immunomodulators (PAL and AA0029) and then challenged with 150 cercariae of S. mansoni . Parasite burden, hepatic lesions and antibody response were studied in vaccination trials. Furthermore differences between rFh15 and rFh15b immunological responses (cytokine production, splenocyte population and antibody levels) were studied. Results Vaccination with nFh12 induced significant reductions in worm burden (83¬†%), eggs in tissues (82‚Äì92¬†%) and hepatic lesions (85¬†%) compared to infected controls using PAL. Vaccination with rFh15 showed lower total worm burden (56‚Äì64¬†%), eggs in the liver (21‚Äì61¬†%), eggs in the gut (30‚Äì77¬†%) and hepatic damage (67‚Äì69¬†%) using PAL and AA0029 as immunomodulators. In contrast, mice vaccinated with rFh15b showed only reductions in eggs trapped in the liver and intestine (53 and 60¬†%, respectively), and hepatic lesions (45¬†%). We observed a significant rise in TNFŒ±, IL-6, IL-2, IL-4 and high antibody response (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgM and IgE) in mice immunised with either rFh15 or rFh15b. Moreover, mice immunised with rFh15b showed an increase in IFNŒ≥ and a decrease in B220 cells compared to untreated mice, and less production of IgG1 and IgM than in mice immunised by rFh15. Conclusions Higher level of protection is obtained by using Fasciola hepatica -derived FABP protein against Schistosoma mansoni infection. Native FABP is more effective than both recombinant systems. It could be due to post-translational modifications or FABP isoform or changes in the recombinant proteins.

0.249313396,30538734,Ecological significance of dorsal polymorphism in a Batesian mimic snake,"Abstract Batesian mimicry is the process in which harmless species adopt the appearance of a dangerous, aposematic species. In some prey species, both Batesian mimetic and non-Batesian morphs coexist, presupposing that both morphs have to be evolutionarily advantageous. The viperine snake, Natrix maura , exhibits a zigzag dorsal pattern and antipredatory behavior that mimics European vipers. This snake also has a striped dorsal pattern that coexists with the zigzag pattern. We have examined whether individuals belonging to different geographically structured clades were more likely to exhibit a certain dorsal pattern, and whether the zigzag pattern has a protective function by exposing artificial snakes to predation in natural environments, in addition to comparing antipredatory behavior between zigzag and striped snakes also in natural environments. Our results indicate that the striped pattern was not geographically structured, but habitat-dependent. Aerial predators less frequently attacked zigzag plasticine models than striped or unpatterned models. We detected a shift in antipredator behavior between the 2 morphs, as Batesian mimicking N. maura responded to an approaching potential predator by remaining immobile or fleeing at shorter distances than did striped ones. We conclude that Batesian mimics maintain the cryptic and aposematic value by resembling vipers, whereas in open habitats the non-Batesian mimic has altered its antipredator behavior to maintain its fitness.",Current zoology,ANIMAL
0.715764247,29755373,"Bidirectional Causal Connectivity in the Cortico-Limbic-Cerebellar Circuit Related to Structural Alterations in First-Episode, Drug-Naive Somatization Disorder","Background: Anatomical and functional deficits in the cortico-limbic-cerebellar circuit are involved in the neurobiology of somatization disorder (SD). The present study was performed to examine causal connectivity of the cortico-limbic-cerebellar circuit related to structural deficits in first-episode, drug-naive patients with SD at rest. Methods: A total of 25 first-episode, drug-naive patients with SD and 28 healthy controls underwent structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry and Granger causality analysis (GCA) were used to analyze the data. Results: Results showed that patients with SD exhibited decreased gray matter volume (GMV) in the right cerebellum Crus I, and increased GMV in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and left angular gyrus. Causal connectivity of the cortico-limbic-cerebellar circuit was partly affected by structural alterations in the patients. Patients with SD showed bidirectional cortico-limbic connectivity abnormalities and bidirectional cortico-cerebellar and limbic-cerebellar connectivity abnormalities. The mean GMV of the right MFG was negatively correlated with the scores of the somatization subscale of the symptom checklist-90 and persistent error response of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) in the patients. A negative correlation was observed between increased driving connectivity from the right MFG to the right fusiform gyrus/cerebellum IV, V and the scores of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire extraversion subscale. The mean GMV of the left ACC was negatively correlated with the WCST number of errors and persistent error response. Negative correlation was found between the causal effect from the left ACC to the right middle temporal gyrus and the scores of WCST number of categories achieved. Conclusions: Our findings show the partial effects of structural alterations on the cortico-limbic-cerebellar circuit in first-episode, drug-naive patients with SD. Correlations are observed between anatomical alterations or causal effects and clinical variables in patients with SD, and bear clinical significance. The present study emphasizes the importance of the cortico-limbic-cerebellar circuit in the neurobiology of SD.",Frontiers in psychiatry,NEURO
0.166795895,26975603,Characterization of long-range functional connectivity in epileptic networks by neuronal spike-triggered local field potentials,"  Objective  Quantifying the relationship between microelectrode-recorded multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFPs) in distinct brain regions can provide detailed information on the extent of functional connectivity in spatially widespread networks. These methods are common in studies of cognition using non-human animal models, but are rare in humans. Here we applied a neuronal spike-triggered impulse response to electrophysiological recordings from the human epileptic brain for the first time, and we evaluate functional connectivity in relation to brain areas supporting the generation of seizures.    Approach  Broadband interictal electrophysiological data were recorded from microwires adapted to clinical depth electrodes that were implanted bilaterally using stereotactic techniques in six presurgical patients with medically refractory epilepsy. MUA and LFPs were isolated in each microwire, and we calculated the impulse response between the MUA on one microwire and the LFPs on a second microwire for all possible MUA/LFP pairs. Results were compared to clinical seizure localization, including sites of seizure onset and interictal epileptiform discharges.    Main results  We detected significant interictal long-range functional connections in each subject, in some cases across hemispheres. Results were consistent between two independent datasets, and the timing and location of significant impulse responses reflected anatomical connectivity. However, within individual subjects, the spatial distribution of impulse responses was unique. In two subjects with clear seizure localization and successful surgery, the epileptogenic zone was associated with significant impulse responses.    Significance  The results suggest that the spike-triggered impulse response can provide valuable information about the neuronal networks that contribute to seizures using only interictal data. This technique will enable testing of specific hypotheses regarding functional connectivity in epilepsy and the relationship between functional properties and imaging findings. Beyond epilepsy, we expect that the impulse response could be more broadly applied as a measure of long-range functional connectivity in studies of cognition.  ",Journal of neural engineering,NEURO
0.308164473,31533612,Automatic discovery of 100-miRNA signature for cancer classification using ensemble feature selection,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules heavily involved in human tumors, in which few of them circulating the human body. Finding a tumor-associated signature of miRNA, that is, the minimum miRNA entities to be measured for discriminating both different types of cancer and normal tissues, is of utmost importance. Feature selection techniques applied in machine learning can help however they often provide naive or biased results. Results An ensemble feature selection strategy for miRNA signatures is proposed. miRNAs are chosen based on consensus on feature relevance from high-accuracy classifiers of different typologies. This methodology aims to identify signatures that are considerably more robust and reliable when used in clinically relevant prediction tasks. Using the proposed method, a 100-miRNA signature is identified in a dataset of 8023 samples, extracted from TCGA. When running eight-state-of-the-art classifiers along with the 100-miRNA signature against the original 1046 features, it could be detected that global accuracy differs only by 1.4%. Importantly, this 100-miRNA signature is sufficient to distinguish between tumor and normal tissues. The approach is then compared against other feature selection methods, such as UFS, RFE, EN, LASSO, Genetic Algorithms, and EFS-CLA. The proposed approach provides better accuracy when tested on a 10-fold cross-validation with different classifiers and it is applied to several GEO datasets across different platforms with some classifiers showing more than 90% classification accuracy, which proves its cross-platform applicability. Conclusions The 100-miRNA signature is sufficiently stable to provide almost the same classification accuracy as the complete TCGA dataset, and it is further validated on several GEO datasets, across different types of cancer and platforms. Furthermore, a bibliographic analysis confirms that 77 out of the 100 miRNAs in the signature appear in lists of circulating miRNAs used in cancer studies, in stem-loop or mature-sequence form. The remaining 23 miRNAs offer potentially promising avenues for future research.

0.175992058,24372758,Patient‚Äìphysician communication about early stage prostate cancer: analysis of overall visit structure,"  Background  We know little about patient‚Äìphysician communication during visits to discuss diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.    Objective  To examine the overall visit structure and how patients and physicians transition between communication activities during visits in which patients received new prostate cancer diagnoses.    Participants  Forty veterans and 18 urologists at one VA medical centre.    Methods  We coded 40 transcripts to identify major communication activities during visits and used empiric discourse analysis to analyse transitions between activities.    Results  We identified five communication activities that occurred in the following typical sequence: ‚Äòdiagnosis delivery‚Äô, ‚Äòrisk classification‚Äô, ‚Äòoptions talk‚Äô, ‚Äòdecision talk‚Äô and ‚Äònext steps‚Äô. The first two activities were typically brief and involved minimal patient participation. Options talk was typically the longest activity; physicians explicitly announced the beginning of options talk and framed it as their professional responsibility. Some patients were unsure of the purpose of visit and/or who should make treatment decisions.    Conclusion  Visits to deliver the diagnosis of early stage prostate cancer follow a regular sequence of communication activities. Physicians focus on discussing treatment options and devote comparatively little time and attention to discussing the new cancer diagnosis. Towards the goal of promoting patient-centred communication, physicians should consider eliciting patient reactions after diagnosis delivery and explaining the decision-making process before describing treatment options.

This study estimated the quantitative relationship between median TDE and median overall survival (OS) in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Methods Studies (excluding allogeneic transplantation) published from 1970 to 2011 were systematically searched (PubMed). The nonparametric Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient measured the association between median TDE and OS. The quantitative relationship between TDEs and OS was estimated with a two-step approach to a simultaneous Tobit model. Results We identified 153 studies: 230 treatment arms, 22,696 patients and mean study duration of 3.8¬†years. Mean of median TDEs was 22.5¬†months and median OS was 39.1¬†months. Correlation coefficients of median TTP, PFS, and EFS with median OS were 0.51 (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003), 0.75 (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001), and 0.84 (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001), respectively. We estimate a 2.5¬†month (95% confidence interval, 1.7‚Äì3.2) increase in median OS for each additional month reported for median TDEs. There was no evidence that this relationship differed by type of surrogate. Conclusion TDEs predict OS in MM patients; this relationship may be valuable in clinical trial design, drug comparisons, and economic evaluation.",BMC cancer,NEURO
0.204454144,30517864,CMV Primes Functional Alternative Signaling in Adaptive Œîg NK Cells but Is Subverted by Lentivirus Infection in Rhesus Macaques,"SUMMARY Despite burgeoning evidence demonstrating the adaptive properties of natural killer (NK) cells, mechanistic data explaining these phenomena are lacking. Following antibody sensitization, NK cells lacking the Fc receptor (FcR) signaling chain (Œîg) acquire adaptive features, including robust proliferation, multi-functionality, rapid killing, and mobilization to sites of virus exposure. Using the rhesus macaque model, we demonstrate the systemic distribution of Œîg NK cells expressing memory features, including downregulated Helios and Eomes. Furthermore, we find that Œîg NK cells abandon typical Œ≥-chain/Syk in lieu of CD3Œ∂-Zap70 signaling. FCŒ≥RIIIa (CD16) density, mucosal homing, and function are all coupled to this alternate signaling, which in itself requires priming by rhesus cytomegalovirus (rhCMV). Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections further expand gut-homing adaptive NK cells but result in pathogenic suppression of CD3Œ∂-Zap70 signaling and function. Herein, we provide a mechanism of virus-dependent alternative signaling that may explain the acquisition of adaptive features by primate NK cells and could be targeted for future vaccine or curative therapies. Graphical Abstract In Brief Gamma-chain-deficient adaptive NK cells are robust mediators of antiviral immunity via ADCC. Shah et al. demonstrate using macaque models that acquisition of these features requires previous priming with CMV infection and involves alternative signaling via CD3zeta but is actively suppressed by lentivirus infection.",Cell reports,IMMUN

We compared genotype resistance testing in patients with virologic failure, by amplification of HIV pol gene, followed by ‚Äúin-house‚Äù sequencing and commercial sequencing.    Methods  Remnant plasma samples from adults and children failing second-line ART were amplified and sequenced using in-house and commercial di-deoxysequencing, and analyzed in Harare, Zimbabwe and at Stanford, U.S.A, respectively. HIV drug resistance mutations were determined using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database.    Results  Twenty-six of 28 samples were amplified and 25 were successfully genotyped. Comparison of average percent nucleotide and amino acid identities between 23 pairs sequenced in both laboratories were 99.51 (¬±0.56) and 99.11 (¬±0.95), respectively. All pairs clustered together in phylogenetic analysis. Sequencing analysis identified 6/23 pairs with mutation discordances resulting in differences in phenotype, but these did not impact future regimens.    Conclusions  The results demonstrate our ability to produce good quality drug resistance data in-house. Despite discordant mutations in some sequence pairs, the phenotypic predictions were not clinically significant.  ",Journal of virological methods,IMMUN
0.742802055,17339967,The Kuleshov Effect: the influence of contextual framing on emotional attributions," Filmmakers have long recognized the importance of editing techniques to guide the audiences' perceptions and enhance the impact of a scene. We demonstrate behaviorally that pairing identical faces with either neutral or emotionally salient contextual movies, an editing technique referred to as the 'Kuleshov Effect', results in both altered attributions of facial expression and mental-state. Using functional neuroimaging (fMRI), we show that faces paired with emotional movies enhance BOLD responses in the bilateral temporal pole, anterior cingulate cortices, amygdala and bilateral superior temporal sulcus relative to identical faces juxtaposed with neutral movies. An interaction was observed in the right amygdala when subtle happy and fear faces were juxtaposed with positive and negative movies, respectively. An interaction between happy faces and negative context was also observed in bilateral amygdala suggesting that the amygdala may act to prime or tag affective value to faces. A parametric modulation of BOLD signal by attribution ratings indicated a dissociation between ventrolateral and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex for negative and positive contextually evoked attributions, respectively. These prefrontal regions may act to guide appropriate choices across altering contexts. Together, these findings offer a neurobiological basis for contextual framing effects on social attributions.

0.246760071,19322589,Analysis of  FTO  Gene Variants with Measures of Obesity and Glucose Homeostasis in the IRAS Family Study," Multiple studies have identified FTO gene variants associated with measures of adiposity in European-derived populations. The study objective was to determine whether FTO variants were associated with adiposity, including visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT; SAT), and glucose homeostasis measures in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Family Study (IRASFS). A total of 27 SNPs in FTO intron 1, including SNPs prominent in the literature (rs9939609, rs8050136, rs1121980, rs17817449, rs1421085, and rs3751812), were genotyped in 1,424 Hispanic Americans and 604 African Americans. Multiple SNPs were associated with BMI and SAT ( p-values ranging from 0.001 to 0.033), and trending or associated with waist circumference ( p-values ranging from 0.008 to 0.099) in the Hispanic Americans. No association was observed with VAT, illustrating that FTO variants are associated with overall fat mass instead of specific fat depots. For the glucose homeostasis measures, variants were associated with fasting insulin but, consistent with other studies, after BMI adjustment, no evidence of association remained. The lack of association of FTO SNPs with insulin sensitivity is consistent with the lack of association with VAT, since these traits are strongly correlated. In the African Americans, only rs8050136 and rs9939609 were associated with BMI and WAIST ( p-values of 0.011 and 0.034), and associated or trending towards association with SAT ( p-values of 0.038 and 0.058). These results confirm that FTO variants are associated with adiposity measures, predisposing individuals to obesity by increasing overall fat mass in Hispanic Americans and to a lesser degree in African Americans.

In order to identify transcripts involved in snail-schistosome interactions, subtractive cDNA libraries were prepared, using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) between a parasite-exposed schistosome-resistant and a susceptible strain of B. glabrata , and also between schistosome-exposed and unexposed snails from the resistant snail line. Separate libraries were made from both haemocytes and the haemopoietic organ. Subtraction was performed in both directions enriching for cDNAs differentially expressed between parasite-exposed resistant and susceptible samples and up or down-regulated in the resistant line after challenge. The resulting eight libraries were screened and eight genes, differentially expressed between the haemocytes of resistant and susceptible snail strains, were identified and confirmed with reverse transcriptase PCR, including two transcripts expected to be involved in the stress response mechanism for regulating the damaging oxidative burst pathways involved in cytotoxic killing of the parasite: the iron-storage and immunoregulatory molecule, ferritin, and HtrA2, a serine protease involved in the cellular stress response. Transcripts with elevated levels in the resistant strain, had the same expression patterns in the subtracted libraries and unsubtracted controls; higher levels in exposed resistant snails compared to susceptible ones and down-regulated in exposed compared with unexposed resistant snails. Differential expression of two of the transcripts with no known function from the susceptible strain, was independently confirmed in a repeat exposure experiment.

0.975788849,27438863,Flexible Molybdenum Electrodes towards Designing Affinity Based Protein Biosensors,Molybdenum electrode based flexible biosensor on porous polyamide substrates has been fabricated and tested for its functionality as a protein affinity based biosensor. The biosensor performance was evaluated using a key cardiac biomarker; cardiac Troponin-I (cTnI). Molybdenum is a transition metal and demonstrates electrochemical behavior upon interaction with an electrolyte. We have leveraged this property of molybdenum for designing an affinity based biosensor using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We have evaluated the feasibility of detection of cTnI in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and human serum (HS) by measuring impedance changes over a frequency window from 100 mHz to 1 MHz. Increasing changes to the measured impedance was correlated to the increased dose of cTnI molecules binding to the cTnI antibody functionalized molybdenum surface. We achieved cTnI detection limit of 10 pg/mL in PBS and 1 ng/mL in HS medium. The use of flexible substrates for designing the biosensor demonstrates promise for integration with a large-scale batch manufacturing process.,Biosensors,ENG
0.275372926,20582544,Routine Ultrasound and Limited Computed Tomography for the Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis,"Background Acute appendicitis continues to be a challenging diagnosis. Preoperative radiological imaging using ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) has gained popularity as it may offer a more accurate diagnosis than classic clinical evaluation. The optimal implementation of these diagnostic modalities has yet to be established. The aim of the present study was to investigate a diagnostic pathway that uses routine US, limited CT, and clinical re-evaluation for patients with acute appendicitis. Methods A prospective analysis was performed of all patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the emergency department from June 2005 until July 2006 using a structured diagnosis and management flowchart. Daily practice was mimicked, while ensuring a valid assessment of clinical and radiological diagnostic accuracies and the effect they had on patient management. Results A total of 802 patients were included in this analysis. Additional radiological imaging was performed in 96.3% of patients with suspected appendicitis ( n =¬†164). Use of CT was kept to a minimum (17.9%), with a US:CT ratio of approximately 6:1. Positive and negative predictive values for the clinical diagnosis of appendicitis were 63 and 98%, respectively; for US 94 and 97%, respectively; and for CT 100 and 100%, respectively. The negative appendicitis rate was 3.3%, the perforation rate was 23.5%, and the missed perforated appendicitis rate was 3.4%. No (diagnostic) laparoscopies were performed. Conclusions A diagnostic pathway using routine US, limited CT, and clinical re-evaluation for patients with acute abdominal pain can provide excellent results for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.",World journal of surgery,CLINIC

This study investigated the evolution from intra- to interspecific phylogeny in the island subspecies Reticulitermes lucifugus corsicus and threw new light on this phenomenon. An integrative approach based on microsatellites and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences was used to analyze samples taken from a wide area around the Tyrrhenian sea and showed how the subspecies evolved from its origins to its most recent form on continental coasts. Results According to mitochondrial phylogeny and molecular clock calculations, island and continental taxa diverged significantly by vicariance in the Pleistocene glacial period. However, more recently, numerous migrations, certainly human-mediated, affected the structure of the populations. This study provided evidence of direct hybridization and multiple introgressions which occurred in several hybrid areas. Analysis using STRUCTURE based on microsatellite data identified a population in Provence (France) which differed considerably (Fst = 0.477) from populations on the island of Corsica and in Tuscany in the Italian peninsula. This new population, principally distributed in urban areas, is highly heterogeneous especially within the ITS2 regions where homogenization by concerted evolution does not appear to have been completed. Conclusion This study provides an unusual picture of genetic interaction between termite populations in the Tyrrhenian area and suggests that more attention should be paid to the role of introgression and human impact on the recent evolution of European termites.",BMC evolutionary biology,ECO

TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB) is a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF TIR1/AFB and acts as an auxin co-receptor for nuclear auxin signaling. The SCF TIR1/AFB -proteasome machinery plays a central regulatory role in development-related gene transcription. Populus trichocarpa , as a model tree, has a unique fast-growth trait to which auxin signaling may contribute. However, no systematic analyses of the genome organization, gene structure, and expression of TIR1-like genes have been undertaken in this woody model plant. In this study, we identified a total of eight TIR1 genes in the Populus genome that are phylogenetically clustered into four subgroups, PtrFBL1/PtrFBL2, PtrFBL3/PtrFBL4, PtrFBL5/PtrFBL6 , and PtrFBL7/PtrFBL8 , representing four paralogous pairs.

Different sets of PtrFBLs were strongly expressed in the leaves, stems, roots, cambial zones, and immature xylem of Populus . Interestingly, PtrFBL1 and 7 were expressed mainly in vascular and cambial tissues, respectively, indicating their potential but different roles in wood formation. Furthermore, Populus FBLs responded differentially upon exposure to various stresses. Finally, over-expression studies indicated a role of FBL1 in poplar stem growth and response to drought stress.

0.989773973,17651426,GABAergic currents in RT and VB thalamic nuclei follow kinetic pattern of Œ±3- and Œ±1-subunit-containing GABA A  receptors," Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) of the thalamic reticular (RT) nucleus are dramatically slower than in the neighboring ventrobasal (VB) neurons. It has been suggested that Œ±3-subunit-containing receptors underlie slow IPSCs in RT neurons, while rapid synaptic currents in the VB nucleus are due to Œ≥-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABA A Rs), including the Œ±1-subunit. In our recent study [ Barberis et al ., 2007 ] we have found that profound differences in kinetics of currents mediated by Œ±3Œ≤2Œ≥2 and Œ±1Œ≤2Œ≥3 receptors resulted from distinct binding and desensitization properties. However, a direct comparison between kinetics of neuronal GABA A Rs from RT and VB neurons and Œ±3- and Œ±1-subunit-containing receptors has not been made. For this purpose, current responses to ultrafast GABA applications were recorded from patches excised from neurons in VB and RT areas. Deactivation kinetics determined for RT and VB neurons closely resembled that in currents mediated by Œ±3Œ≤2Œ≥2 and Œ±1Œ≤2Œ≥2 receptors. In RT neurons, currents elicited by non-saturating [GABA] had a remarkably slow onset, a hallmark of Œ±3-subunit-containing receptors. In VB and RT neurons, single-channel currents elicited by brief GABA pulses had similar characteristics to those of Œ±1Œ≤2Œ≥2 and Œ±3Œ≤2Œ≥2 receptors. However, in stationary conditions, similarity between single-channel currents in neurons and respective recombinant receptors was less apparent. We propose that the non-stationary kinetics of GABAergic currents in VB and RT nuclei mimic that of currents mediated by Œ±1- and Œ±3-subunit-containing receptors. The dissimilarity between stationary kinetics of neuronal and recombinant receptors probably reflects differences between GABA A Rs mediating phasic and tonic currents in these neurons.

Diabetes mellitus including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a suspected risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer and nearly 45% of the pancreatic cancer cases are likely to present as new onset diabetes cases; however, the nature of association between T2D and pancreatic cancer is still controversial. In this meta-analysis, we examined the association specifically of T2D with pancreatic cancer and the influence of insulin therapy. PubMed, EMBASE, Scholar, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched to identify clinical and patient oriented studies that examined the incidence of diabetes in pancreatic cancer patients and vice versa, over the last 10 years. All the authors independently screened the articles, and a collective decision was reached about the studies included in the meta-analysis. Parameters analyzed included, the Incidence of diabetes in pancreatic cancer patients; duration history of T2D in pancreatic cancer patients; influence of insulin therapy in T2D patients on pancreatic cancer incidence. Eleven studies with a total of 14,399 patients, of whom 4,080 were T2D-positive and 9,721 were non-diabetic were included in this meta-analysis. T2D duration history was significantly related to pancreatic cancer incidence and insulin therapy effects.

The gutless females (and in one species also the males) have a unique root system that penetrates the bone and nourishes them via endosymbiotic bacteria. Emerging from the bone is a cylindrical trunk, which is enclosed in a transparent tube, that generally gives rise to a plume of four palps (or tentacles). In most Osedax species, dwarf males gather in harems along the female‚Äôs trunk and the nervous system of these microscopic forms has been described in detail. Here, the nervous system of bone-eating Osedax forms are described for the first time, allowing for hypotheses on how the abberant ventral brain and nervous system of Siboglinidae may have evolved from a ganglionated nervous system with a dorsal brain, as seen in most extant annelids. Results The intraepidermal nervous systems of four female Osedax spp. and the bone-eating O. priapus male were reconstructed in detail by a combination of immunocytochemistry, CLSM, histology and TEM. They all showed a simple nervous system composed of an anterior ventral brain, connected with anteriorly directed paired palp and gonoduct nerves, and four main pairs of posteriorly directed longitudinal nerves (2 ventral, 2 ventrolateral, 2 sets of dorso-lateral, 2 dorsal). Transverse peripheral nerves surround the trunk, ovisac and root system. The nervous system of Osedax resembles that of other siboglinids, though possibly presenting additional lateral and dorsal longitudinal nerves. It differs from most Sedentaria in the presence of an intraepidermal ventral brain, rather than a subepidermal dorsal brain, and by having an intraepidermal nerve cord with several plexi and up to three main commissures along the elongated trunk, which may comprise two indistinct segments. Conclusions Osedax shows closer neuroarchitectural resemblance to Vestimentifera‚Äâ+ Sclerolinum (= Monilifera) than to Frenulata. The intraepidermal nervous system with widely separated nerve cords, double brain commissures, double palp nerves and other traits found in Osedax can all be traced to represent ancestral states of Siboglinidae. A broader comparison of the nervous system and body regions across Osedax and other siboglinids allows for a reinterpretation of the anterior body region in the group.",BMC evolutionary biology,ECO
0.741867766,25871441,Evaluation of CADD Scores in Curated Mismatch Repair Gene Variants Yields a Model for Clinical Validation and Prioritization,"ABSTRACT Next‚Äêgeneration sequencing in clinical diagnostics is providing valuable genomic variant data, which can be used to support healthcare decisions. In silico tools to predict pathogenicity are crucial to assess such variants and we have evaluated a new tool, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), and its classification of gene variants in Lynch syndrome by using a set of 2,210 DNA mismatch repair gene variants. These had already been classified by experts from InSiGHT's Variant Interpretation Committee. Overall, we found CADD scores do predict pathogenicity (Spearman's œÅ = 0.595, P < 0.001). However, we discovered 31 major discrepancies between the InSiGHT classification and the CADD scores; these were explained in favor of the expert classification using population allele frequencies, cosegregation analyses, disease association studies, or a second‚Äêtier test. Of 751 variants that could not be clinically classified by InSiGHT, CADD indicated that 47 variants were worth further study to confirm their putative pathogenicity. We demonstrate CADD is valuable in prioritizing variants in clinically relevant genes for further assessment by expert classification teams.",Human mutation,POPGENE

Here we use isobaric labeling multiplexed proteomics to analyze protein co-regulation and show that this allows the identification of protein-protein associations with high accuracy. We apply this ‚Äòinteractome mapping by high-throughput quantitative proteome analysis‚Äô (IMAHP) method to a panel of 41 breast cancer cell lines and show that deviations of the observed protein co-regulations in specific cell lines from the consensus network impacts to cellular fitness. Furthermore, these aberrant interactions serve as biomarkers predicting drug sensitivity of cell lines in screens across 195 drugs. We expect that IMAHP can be broadly used to gain insight into how changing landscapes of protein-protein associations affect the phenotype of biological systems. ",Nature biotechnology,ENG
0.243709956,20158307,Clustering of Trauma and Associations with Single and Co-Occurring Depression and Panic Attack over Twenty Years," I ndividuals who experience one type of trauma often experience other types, yet few studies have examined the clustering of trauma. This study examines the clustering of traumatic events and associations of trauma with risk for single and co-occurring major depressive disorder (MDD) and panic attack for 20 years after first trauma. Lifetime histories of MDD, panic attack, and traumatic events were obtained from participants in an Australian twin sample. Latent class analysis was used to derive trauma classes based on each respondent‚Äôs trauma history. Associations of the resulting classes and of parental alcohol problems and familial effects with risk for a first onset of single and co-occurring MDD and panic attack were examined from the year of first trauma to 20 years later. Traumatic events clustered into three distinct classes characterized by endorsement of little or no trauma, primarily nonassaultive, and primarily assaultive events. Individuals in the assaultive class were characterized by a younger age at first trauma, a greater number of traumatic events, and high rates of parental alcohol problems. Members of the assaultive trauma class had the strongest and most enduring risk for single and co-occurring lifetime MDD and panic attack. Assaultive trauma outweighed associations of familial effects and nonassaultive trauma with risk for 10 years following first trauma.

0.282894164,26038508,Multiple introductions of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses into Bangladesh,"Highly pathogenic H5N1 and low pathogenic H9N2 influenza viruses are endemic to poultry markets in Bangladesh and have cocirculated since 2008. H9N2 influenza viruses circulated constantly in the poultry markets, whereas highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses occurred sporadically, with peaks of activity in cooler months. Thirty highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from poultry were characterized by antigenic, molecular, and phylogenetic analyses. Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses from clades 2.2.2 and 2.3.2.1 were isolated from live bird markets only. Phylogenetic analysis of the 30 H5N1 isolates revealed multiple introductions of H5N1 influenza viruses in Bangladesh. There was no reassortment between the local H9N2 influenza viruses and H5N1 genotype, despite their prolonged cocirculation. However, we detected two reassortant H5N1 viruses, carrying the M gene from the Chinese H9N2 lineage, which briefly circulated in the Bangladesh poultry markets and then disappeared. On the other hand, interclade reassortment occurred within H5N1 lineages and played a role in the genesis of the currently dominant H5N1 viruses in Bangladesh. Few ‚Äòhuman-like' mutations in H5N1 may account for the limited number of human cases. Antigenically, clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 viruses in Bangladesh have evolved since their introduction and are currently mainly homogenous, and show evidence of recent antigenic drift. Although reassortants containing H9N2 genes were detected in live poultry markets in Bangladesh, these reassortants failed to supplant the dominant H5N1 lineage.",Emerging microbes & infections,IMMUN

Methods The authors assessed the performance of a histidine-rich protein 2-based malaria rapid diagnostic test used by community health workers in the context of an integrated approach to diagnosis and treatment for malaria and pneumonia. A total of 525 children below 5¬†years of age were recruited into the study. Children with fever/history of fever within the last 24¬†h were tested with the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a blood smear was obtained for delayed reading. Results Overall, the FirstSign‚Ñ¢ Malaria Pf (Unimed International Inc, South San Francisco, USA) has shown a high sensitivity profile of 97.9% (95% CI 96.3‚Äì98.8), but a low specificity of 53.4% (95% CI 49.1‚Äì57.7). The specificity was significantly lower during the high transmission season at 25.4% (95% CI 20.5‚Äì31.0) compared to 63.7% (95% CI 57.6‚Äì69.4%) at the low transmission season. The negative predictive value (NPV) was 95.4% (95% CI 93.2‚Äì96.9) and positive predictive value was 71.7% (95% CI 67.7‚Äì75.4). The NPV was significantly higher during the low transmission season at 98.2% (95% CI 95.7‚Äì99.3) than compared to 80.0% (95% CI 74.7‚Äì84.4) at the high transmission season.

Traditional NO 2 gas sensors with highly operated temperatures (200‚Äì600 ¬∞C) and limited reversibility are mainly constructed from semiconducting oxide-deposited ceramic tubes or inter-finger probes. Herein, we report the functionalized graphene network film sensors assembled on an electrospun three-dimensional (3D) nanonetwork skeleton for ultrasensitive NO 2 sensing. The functional 3D scaffold was prepared by electrospinning interconnected polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers onto a nylon window screen to provide a 3D nanonetwork skeleton. Then, the sulfophenyl-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (SFRGO) was assembled on the electrospun 3D nanonetwork skeleton to form SFRGO network films. The assembled functionalized graphene network film sensors exhibit excellent NO 2 sensing performance (10 ppb to 20 ppm) at room temperature, reliable reversibility, good selectivity, and better sensing cycle stability. These improvements can be ascribed to the functionalization of graphene with electron-withdrawing sulfophenyl groups, the high surface-to-volume ratio, and the effective sensing channels from SFRGO wrapping onto the interconnected 3D scaffold. The SFRGO network-sensing film has the advantages of simple preparation, low cost, good processability, and ultrasensitive NO 2 sensing, all advantages that can be utilized for potential integration into smart windows and wearable electronic devices for real-time household gas sensors.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",ENG

However, previous investigations did not distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from a similar oxidative form with opposite functions, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we measured blood DNA global 5mC and 5hmC by ELISA and used adjusted mixed-effects regression models to evaluate the effects of ambient PM 10 and personal PM 2.5 and its elemental components‚Äîblack carbon (BC), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and zinc (Zn)‚Äîon blood global 5mC and 5hmC levels. The study was conducted in 60 truck drivers and 60 office workers in Beijing, China from The Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study at 2 exams separated by one to 2 weeks. Blood 5hmC level (0.08%) was ‚àº83-fold lower than 5mC (6.61%). An inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in same-day PM 10 was associated with increases in 5hmC of 26.1% in office workers ( P = 0.004), 20.2% in truck drivers ( P = 0.014), and 21.9% in all participants combined ( P < 0.001). PM 10 effects on 5hmC were increasingly stronger when averaged over 4, 7, and 14 d preceding assessment (up to 132.6% for the 14-d average in all participants, P < 0.001). PM 10 effects were also significant after controlling for multiple testing (family-wise error rate; FWER < 0.05). 5hmC was not correlated with personal measures of PM 2.5 and elemental components (FWER > 0.05). 5mC showed no correlations with PM 10 , PM 2.5 , and elemental components measures (FWER > 0.05). Our study suggests that exposure to ambient PM 10 affects 5hmC over time, but not 5mC.

0.258054235,27357169,Local versus global biological network alignment,"Motivation: Network alignment (NA) aims to find regions of similarities between species‚Äô molecular networks. There exist two NA categories: local (LNA) and global (GNA). LNA finds small highly conserved network regions and produces a many-to-many node mapping. GNA finds large conserved regions and produces a one-to-one node mapping. Given the different outputs of LNA and GNA, when a new NA method is proposed, it is compared against existing methods from the same category. However, both NA categories have the same goal: to allow for transferring functional knowledge from well- to poorly-studied species between conserved network regions. So, which one to choose, LNA or GNA? To answer this, we introduce the first systematic evaluation of the two NA categories. Results: We introduce new measures of alignment quality that allow for fair comparison of the different LNA and GNA outputs, as such measures do not exist. We provide user-friendly software for efficient alignment evaluation that implements the new and existing measures. We evaluate prominent LNA and GNA methods on synthetic and real-world biological networks. We study the effect on alignment quality of using different interaction types and confidence levels. We find that the superiority of one NA category over the other is context-dependent. Further, when we contrast LNA and GNA in the application of learning novel protein functional knowledge, the two produce very different predictions, indicating their complementarity. Our results and software provide guidelines for future NA method development and evaluation.

We used a nonhuman primate (NHP) model with a synthetic swarm of sequence-tagged variants of SIVmac239 (‚ÄúSIVmac239X‚Äù) and scheduled necropsy during primary infection (days 3 to 14 after challenge) to study viral dynamics and host responses to the establishment and dissemination of infection following vaginal challenge. We demonstrate that local replication was initiated at multiple sites within the female genital tract (FGT), with each site having multiple viral variants. Local replication and spread in the FGT preceded lymphatic dissemination. Innate viral restriction factors were observed but appeared to follow viral replication and were ineffective at blocking initial viral establishment and dissemination. However, major delays were observed in time to dissemination in animals and among different viral variants within the same animal. It will be important to assess how phenotypic differences affect early viral dynamics.",Science advances,IMMUN
0.115519521,27110093,Entropy  vs.  Energy Waveform Processing: A Comparison Based on the Heat Equation," Virtually all modern imaging devices collect electromagnetic or acoustic waves and use the energy carried by these waves to determine pixel values to create what is basically an ‚Äúenergy‚Äù picture. However, waves also carry ‚Äúinformation‚Äù, as quantified by some form of entropy, and this may also be used to produce an ‚Äúinformation‚Äù image. Numerous published studies have demonstrated the advantages of entropy, or ‚Äúinformation imaging‚Äù, over conventional methods. The most sensitive information measure appears to be the joint entropy of the collected wave and a reference signal. The sensitivity of repeated experimental observations of a slowly-changing quantity may be defined as the mean variation ( i.e. , observed change) divided by mean variance ( i.e. , noise). Wiener integration permits computation of the required mean values and variances as solutions to the heat equation, permitting estimation of their relative magnitudes. There always exists a reference, such that joint entropy has larger variation and smaller variance than the corresponding quantities for signal energy, matching observations of several studies. Moreover, a general prescription for finding an ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù reference for the joint entropy emerges, which also has been validated in several studies. ","Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)",CS

0.379118417,20049121,"Exposure to Hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) via Dust Ingestion, but Not Diet, Correlates with Concentrations in Human Serum: Preliminary Results","Background Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is a high-production-volume chemical used as flame retardant in polystyrene insulation and textiles. Because it is not chemically bound to the polymer, HBCD can migrate into the environment, contaminating indoor dust and foodstuff. Objectives We examined for the first time the relationship between combined exposure to three HBCD isomers (‚àëHBCDs) via ingestion of food (duplicate diets) and indoor dust and HBCD concentrations in serum for 16 Belgian adults (20‚Äì25 years of age). We also determined the chiral signatures of HBCDs to advance understanding of source-to-human enantioselective degradation and/or metabolism. Methods Concentrations and chiral signatures of Œ±-, Œ≤-, and Œ≥-HBCD in duplicate diets, dust, and serum were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Results Dietary intakes of ‚àëHBCDs were 1.2‚Äì20 ng/day (average, 7.2 ng/day), whereas those estimated under average (20 mg dust/day) and high (50 mg dust/day) dust ingestion scenarios were 1.1‚Äì15 ng/day (average intake, 3.2 ng/day) and 2.8‚Äì38 ng/day (average intake, 8.0 ng/day), respectively. Concentrations of ‚àëHBCDs measured in blood serum were < 0.5 to 11 ng/g lipid weight (lw) (average, 2.9 ng/g lw). Œ≥-HBCD dominated in food, whereas Œ±-HBCD dominated in dust and was the sole isomer in serum. Although exposure via dust ingestion correlated significantly ( p < 0.01) with concentrations in serum, no such correlation was evident with dietary exposure ( p > 0.1). Although no enantioselective enrichment was detected in either dust or diet, substantial enrichment of (‚àí)Œ±-HBCD was observed in serum. Conclusions Serum concentrations of HBCDs were correlated with the exposure via dust, but not via dietary ingestion. The enrichment of the (‚àí)Œ±-HBCD enantiomer in humans appears to be due to in vivo enantioselective metabolism/excretion rather than ingestion of dust or diet.",Environmental health perspectives,ENVIRON

Methods: Whole-exome sequencing ( n = 9), targeted resequencing ( n = 4), and haplotyping were performed. Immunohistochemistry of sex-specific markers was performed on patients' gonads. The consequences of mutation were investigated using luciferase assays, localization studies, and RNA-seq. Results: We identified a novel heterozygous NR5A1 mutation, c.274C>T p.(Arg92Trp), in three unrelated patients. The Arg92 residue is highly conserved and located in the Ftz-F1 region, probably involved in DNA-binding specificity and stability. There were no consistent changes in transcriptional activation or subcellular localization. Transcriptomics in patient-derived lymphocytes showed upregulation of MAMLD1 , a direct NR5A1 target previously associated with 46,XY DSD. In gonads of affected individuals, ovarian FOXL2 and testicular SRY -independent SOX9 expression observed. Conclusions: We propose NR5A1 , previously associated with 46,XY DSD and 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency, as a novel gene for 46,XX (ovo)testicular DSD. We hypothesize that p.(Arg92Trp) results in decreased inhibition of the male developmental pathway through downregulation of female antitestis genes, thereby tipping the balance toward testicular differentiation in 46,XX individuals.

0.690678996,22072970,The Pore-Forming Toxin Listeriolysin O Mediates a Novel Entry Pathway of  L. monocytogenes  into Human Hepatocytes,"Intracellular pathogens have evolved diverse strategies to invade and survive within host cells. Among the most studied facultative intracellular pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes is known to express two invasins-InlA and InlB-that induce bacterial internalization into nonphagocytic cells. The pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) facilitates bacterial escape from the internalization vesicle into the cytoplasm, where bacteria divide and undergo cell-to-cell spreading via actin-based motility. In the present study we demonstrate that in addition to InlA and InlB, LLO is required for efficient internalization of L. monocytogenes into human hepatocytes (HepG2). Surprisingly, LLO is an invasion factor sufficient to induce the internalization of noninvasive Listeria innocua or polystyrene beads into host cells in a dose-dependent fashion and at the concentrations produced by L. monocytogenes . To elucidate the mechanisms underlying LLO-induced bacterial entry, we constructed novel LLO derivatives locked at different stages of the toxin assembly on host membranes. We found that LLO-induced bacterial or bead entry only occurs upon LLO pore formation. Scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy studies show that LLO-coated beads stimulate the formation of membrane extensions that ingest the beads into an early endosomal compartment. This LLO-induced internalization pathway is dynamin-and F-actin-dependent, and clathrin-independent. Interestingly, further linking pore formation to bacteria/bead uptake, LLO induces F-actin polymerization in a tyrosine kinase-and pore-dependent fashion. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that a bacterial pathogen perforates the host cell plasma membrane as a strategy to activate the endocytic machinery and gain entry into the host cell. Author Summary  Listeria monocytogenes is responsible for the severe foodborne disease listeriosis. During pathogenesis, invasion of nonphagocytic cells by L. monocytogenes is crucial for crossing the host epithelial barriers and colonization of multiple organs including the liver. In this study, we investigated the role of the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) in L. monocytogenes entry into human hepatocytes. LLO belongs to the largest family of bacterial pore-forming toxins called the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins and is a major virulence factor of L. monocytogenes . We observed that LLO is required for efficient entry of L. monocytogenes into hepatocytes and shed light on the molecular processes involved in this activity. Using different experimental approaches, we provide the first evidence that LLO is sufficient to induce bacterial internalization into host cells by a pore-dependent mechanism. LLO induces tyrosine kinase(s)-, dynamin-, and F-actin-dependent formation of an internalization vesicle. Similar to LLO, the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin regulates bacterial entry into host cells. Together, these findings indicate that host membrane perforation by a pore-forming toxin can be used as an invasion strategy by L. monocytogenes and raise the hypothesis that other bacteria may use a similar entry pathway.",PLoS pathogens,IMMUN
0.471896302,29559981,Gene Profiling in Patients with Systemic Sclerosis Reveals the Presence of Oncogenic Gene Signatures,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by three pathogenetic hallmarks: vasculopathy, dysregulation of the immune system, and fibrosis. A particular feature of SSc is the increased frequency of some types of malignancies, namely breast, lung, and hematological malignancies. Moreover, SSc may also be a paraneoplastic disease, again indicating a strong link between cancer and scleroderma. The reason of this association is still unknown; therefore, we aimed at investigating whether particular genetic or epigenetic factors may play a role in promoting cancer development in patients with SSc and whether some features are shared by the two conditions. We therefore performed a gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from patients with limited and diffuse SSc, showing that the various classes of genes potentially linked to the pathogenesis of SSc (such as apoptosis, endothelial cell activation, extracellular matrix remodeling, immune response, and inflammation) include genes that directly participate in the development of malignancies or that are involved in pathways known to be associated with carcinogenesis. The transcriptional analysis was then complemented by a complex network analysis of modulated genes which further confirmed the presence of signaling pathways associated with carcinogenesis. Since epigenetic mechanisms, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), are believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of SSc, we also evaluated whether specific cancer-related miRNAs could be deregulated in the serum of SSc patients. We focused our attention on miRNAs already found upregulated in SSc such as miR-21-5p, miR-92a-3p, and on miR-155-5p, miR 126-3p and miR-16-5p known to be deregulated in malignancies associated to SSc, i.e., breast, lung, and hematological malignancies. miR-21-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-155-5p, and miR-16-5p expression was significantly higher in SSc sera compared to healthy controls. Our findings indicate the presence of modulated genes and miRNAs that can play a predisposing role in the development of malignancies in SSc and are important for a better risk stratification of patients and for the identification of a better individualized precision medicine strategy.",Frontiers in immunology,IMMUN
0.329288043,24779348,An Investigation of G-Quadruplex Structural Polymorphism in the Human Telomere Using a Combined Approach of Hydrodynamic Bead Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Simulation,"Guanine-rich oligonucleotides can adopt noncanonical tertiary structures known as G-quadruplexes, which can exist in different forms depending on experimental conditions. High-resolution structural methods, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, have been of limited usefulness in resolving the inherent structural polymorphism associated with G-quadruplex formation. The lack of, or the ambiguous nature of, currently available high-resolution structural data, in turn, has severely hindered investigations into the nature of these structures and their interactions with small-molecule inhibitors. We have used molecular dynamics in conjunction with hydrodynamic bead modeling to study the structures of the human telomeric G-quadruplex-forming sequences at the atomic level. We demonstrated that molecular dynamics can reproduce experimental hydrodynamic measurements and thus can be a powerful tool in the structural study of existing G-quadruplex sequences or in the prediction of new G-quadruplex structures.",The journal of physical chemistry.

0.546913138,22126325,Gray matter loss correlates with mesial temporal lobe neuronal hyperexcitability inside the human seizure onset zone," Summary   Purpose  Patient studies have not provided consistent evidence for interictal neuronal hyperexcitability inside the seizure onset zone (SOZ). We hypothesized that gray matter (GM) loss could have important effects on neuronal firing, and quantifying these effects would reveal significant differences in neuronal firing inside versus outside the SOZ.    Methods  MRI and computational unfolding of mesial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions was used to construct anatomical maps to compute GM loss in presurgical patients with medically intractable focal seizures in relation to control subjects. In patients, these same maps were used to locate the position of microelectrodes that recorded interictal neuronal activity. Single neuron firing and burst rates were evaluated in relation to GM loss and MTL subregions inside and outside the SOZ.    Key findings  MTL GM thickness was reduced inside and outside the SOZ in patients with respect to control subjects, yet GM loss was associated more strongly with firing and burst rates in several MTL subregions inside the SOZ. Adjusting single neuron firing and burst rates for the effects of GM loss revealed significantly higher firing rates in the subregion consisting of dentate gyrus and CA2 and CA3 (CA23DG), as well as CA1 and entorhinal cortex (EC) inside versus outside the SOZ where normalized MRI GM loss was ‚â•1.40 mm. Firing rates were higher in subicular cortex inside the SOZ at GM loss ‚â•1.97 mm, while burst rates were higher in CA23DG, CA1, and EC inside than outside the SOZ at similar levels of GM loss.    Significance  The correlation between GM loss and increased firing and burst rates suggests GM structural alterations in MTL subregions are associated with interictal neuronal hyperexcitability inside the SOZ. Significant differences in firing rates and bursting in areas with GM loss inside compared to outside the SOZ indicate that synaptic reorganization following cell loss could be associated with varying degrees of epileptogenicity in patients with intractable focal seizures.

0.718966526,21523828,Exclusion of the  GNAS  Locus in PHP-Ib Patients With Broad  GNAS  Methylation Changes: Evidence for an Autosomal Recessive Form of PHP-Ib?," Most patients with autosomal dominant pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (AD-PHP-Ib) carry maternally inherited microdeletions upstream of GNAS that are associated with loss of methylation restricted to GNAS exon A/B. Only few AD-PHP-Ib patients carry microdeletions within GNAS that are associated with loss of all maternal methylation imprints. These epigenetic changes are often indistinguishable from those observed in patients affected by an apparently sporadic PHP-Ib form that has not yet been defined genetically. We have now investigated six female patients affected by PHP-Ib (four unrelated and two sisters) with complete or almost complete loss of GNAS methylation, whose healthy children (11 in total) showed no epigenetic changes at this locus. Analysis of several microsatellite markers throughout the 20q13 region made it unlikely that PHP-Ib is caused in these patients by large deletions involving GNAS or by paternal uniparental isodisomy or heterodisomy of chromosome 20 (patUPD20). Microsatellite and single-nucleotide variation (SNV) data revealed that the two affected sisters share their maternally inherited GNAS alleles with unaffected relatives that lack evidence for abnormal GNAS methylation, thus excluding linkage to this locus. Consistent with these findings, healthy children of two unrelated sporadic PHP-Ib patients had inherited different maternal GNAS alleles, also arguing against linkage to this locus. Based on our data, it appears plausible that some forms of PHP-Ib are caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation(s) in an unknown gene involved in establishing or maintaining GNAS methylation.

0.185760665,30608583,Genome Sequence of  Jaltomata  Addresses Rapid Reproductive Trait Evolution and Enhances Comparative Genomics in the Hyper-Diverse Solanaceae,"Abstract Within the economically important plant family Solanaceae, Jaltomata is a rapidly evolving genus that has extensive diversity in flower size and shape, as well as fruit and nectar color, among its ‚àº80 species. Here, we report the whole-genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation, of one representative species ( Jaltomata sinuosa ) from this genus. Combining PacBio long reads (25√ó) and Illumina short reads (148√ó) achieved an assembly of ‚àº1.45‚ÄâGb, spanning ‚àº96% of the estimated genome. Ninety-six percent of curated single-copy orthologs in plants were detected in the assembly, supporting a high level of completeness of the genome. Similar to other Solanaceous species, repetitive elements made up a large fraction (‚àº80%) of the genome, with the most recently active element, Gypsy , expanding across the genome in the last 1‚Äì2 Myr. Computational gene prediction, in conjunction with a merged transcriptome data set from 11 tissues, identified 34,725 protein-coding genes. Comparative phylogenetic analyses with six other sequenced Solanaceae species determined that Jaltomata is most likely sister to Solanum , although a large fraction of gene trees supported a conflicting bipartition consistent with substantial introgression between Jaltomata and Capsicum after these species split. We also identified gene family dynamics specific to Jaltomata , including expansion of gene families potentially involved in novel reproductive trait development, and loss of gene families that accompanied the loss of self-incompatibility. This high-quality genome will facilitate studies of phenotypic diversification in this rapidly radiating group and provide a new point of comparison for broader analyses of genomic evolution across the Solanaceae.",Genome biology and evolution,ECO
0.251474064,21194225,An Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography ‚Äì Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method for Biomonitoring Cooked Meat Carcinogens and Their Metabolites in Human Urine," The cooked meat carcinogens 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5- b ]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5- f ]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and their principal metabolites produced by cytochrome P450 and/or uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases were simultaneously measured at the parts per trillion level in urine of omnivores, by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with a Michrom Advance CaptiveSpray ‚Ñ¢, source and a triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitation was performed in the selected reaction monitoring mode. The UPLC method is much more rapid and sensitive than our earlier capillary HPLC method: the duty cycle of the UPLC method is 19 minutes compared to 57 minutes for capillary HPLC. The performance of the UPLC assay was evaluated with urine samples from three subjects over 4 different days. The intraday and interday precisions of the estimates of PhIP, MeIQx, and their metabolites, reported as the coefficients of variation, were ‚â§10%. The limit of quantification (LOQ) values for PhIP and MeIQx were about 5 pg/mL, whereas the LOQ values of their metabolites ranged from 10 to 40 pg/mL. Furthermore, the identities of the analytes were corroborated by acquisition of full scan product ion spectra, employing between 0.5 and 5 pg of analyte for assay. ",Analytical chemistry,CHEM

0.986540637,29204911,Repeated shock stress facilitates basolateral amygdala synaptic plasticity through decreased cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase type IV (PDE4) expression," Previous studies have shown that exposure to stressful events can enhance fear-memory and anxiety-like behavior as well as increase synaptic plasticity in the rat basolateral amygdala (BLA). We have evidence that repeated unpredictable shock stress (USS) elicits a long-lasting increase in anxiety-like behavior in rats, but the cellular mechanisms mediating this response remain unclear. Evidence from recent morphological studies suggests that alterations in the dendritic arbor or spine density of BLA principal neurons may underlie stress-induced anxiety behavior. Recently, we have shown that the induction of long term potentiation (LTP) in BLA principal neurons is dependent on activation of postsynaptic D1 dopamine receptors and the subsequent activation of the cyclic adenosine 5‚Äô-monophosphate (cAMP) - protein kinase A (PKA) signaling cascade. Here, we have used in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recording from BLA principal neurons to investigate the long-term consequences of USS on their morphological properties and synaptic plasticity. We provided evidence that the enhanced anxiety-like behavior in response to USS was not associated with any significant change in the morphological properties of BLA principal neurons, but was associated with a changed frequency-dependence of synaptic plasticity, lowered LTP induction threshold, and reduced expression of phosphodiesterase type 4 enzymes (PDE4s). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PDE4 activity with rolipram mimics the effects of chronic stress on LTP induction threshold and baseline startle. Our results provide the first evidence that stress both enhances anxiety-like behavior and facilitates synaptic plasticity in the amygdala through a common mechanism of PDE4-mediated disinhibition of cAMP-PKA signaling.

0.472149765,29878747,High Throughput Screens to Identify Autophagy Inducers that Function by Disrupting Beclin 1/Bcl-2 Binding," Autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway, plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis, development, immunity, tumor suppression, metabolism, prevention of neurodegeneration and lifespan extension. Thus, pharmacological stimulation of autophagy may be an effective approach for preventing or treating certain human diseases and/or aging. We sought to establish a method for developing new chemical compounds that specifically induce autophagy. To do this, we developed two assays to identify compounds that target a key regulatory node of autophagy induction ‚Äì specifically, the binding of Bcl-2 (a negative regulator of autophagy) to Beclin 1 (an allosteric modulator of the Beclin 1/VPS34 lipid kinase complex that functions in autophagy initiation). These assays use either a split-luciferase assay to measure Beclin 1/Bcl-2 binding in cells or an AlphaLISA assay to directly measure direct Beclin 1/Bcl-2 binding in vitro . We screened two different chemical compound libraries, comprising ~300K compounds, to identify small molecules that disrupt Beclin 1/Bcl-2 binding and induce autophagy. Three novel compounds were identified that directly inhibit Beclin 1/Bcl-2 interaction with an IC 50 in the micromolar range and increase autophagic flux. These compounds do not demonstrate significant cytotoxicity and they exert selectivity for disruption of Bcl-2 binding to the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 compared to the BH3 domain of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bax and Bim. Thus, we have identified candidate molecules that serve as lead templates for developing potent and selective Beclin 1/Bcl-2 inhibitors that may be clinically useful as autophagy-inducing agents.

0.4344299,26190071,Mosquitoes use vision to associate odor plumes with thermal targets," Summary  All moving animals, including flies [ 1 ‚Äì 3 ], sharks [ 4 ], and humans [ 5 ], experience a dynamic sensory landscape that is a function of both their trajectory through space and the distribution of stimuli in the environment. This is particularly apparent for mosquitoes, which use a combination of olfactory, visual, and thermal cues to locate hosts [ 6 ‚Äì 10 ]. Mosquitoes are thought to detect suitable hosts by the presence of a sparse CO 2 plume, which they track by surging upwind and casting crosswind [ 11 ]. Upon approach, local cues such as heat and skin volatiles help them identify a landing site [ 12 ‚Äì 15 ]. Recent evidence suggests that thermal attraction is gated by the presence of CO 2 [ 6 ], although this conclusion was based experiments in which the actual flight trajectories of the animals were unknown and visual cues were not studied. Using a 3-dimensional tracking system we show that rather than gating heat sensing, the detection of CO 2 actually activates a strong attraction to visual features. This visual reflex guides the mosquitoes to potential hosts where they are close enough to detect thermal cues. By experimentally decoupling the olfactory, visual, and thermal cues, we show that the motor reactions to these stimuli are independently controlled. Given that humans become visible to mosquitoes at a distance of 5‚Äì15 m [ 16 ], visual cues play a critical intermediate role in host localization by coupling long-range plume tracking to behaviors that require short-range cues. Rather than direct neural coupling, the separate sensory-motor reflexes are linked as a result of the interaction between the animal‚Äôs reactions and the spatial structure of the stimuli in the environment.

In this investigation we sought to determine the sensitivity of imaging methods to detect macrostructural (volume) and microstructural (diffusivity) longitudinal change in HD. We used a 3T MRI scanner to acquire T 1 and diffusion weighted images at baseline and 18 months in 31 pre-HD, 31 symp-HD and 29 controls. Volume was measured across the whole brain, and volume and diffusion measures were ascertained for caudate and putamen. We observed a range of significant volumetric and, for the first time, diffusion changes over 18 months in both pre-HD and symp-HD, relative to controls, detectable at the brain-wide level (volume change in grey and white matter) and in caudate and putamen (volume and diffusivity change). Importantly, longitudinal volume change in the caudate was the only measure that discriminated between groups across all stages of disease: far from diagnosis (>15 years), close to diagnosis (<15 years) and after diagnosis. Of the two diffusion metrics (mean diffusivity, MD; fractional anisotropy, FA), only longitudinal FA change was sensitive to group differences, but only after diagnosis. These findings further confirm caudate atrophy as one of the most sensitive and early biomarkers of neurodegeneration in HD. They also highlight that different tissue properties have varying schedules in their ability to discriminate between groups along disease progression and may therefore inform biomarker selection for future therapeutic interventions.",PloS one,NEURO
0.550172156,16189711,Geography is a better determinant of human genetic differentiation than ethnicity," Individuals differ genetically in their susceptibility to particular diseases and their response to drugs. However, personalized treatments are difficult to develop, because disease susceptibility and drug response generally have poorly characterized genetic architecture. It is thus tempting to use the ethnicity of patients to capture some of the variation in allele frequencies at the genes underlying a clinical trait. The success of such a strategy depends on whether human populations can be accurately classified into discrete genetic ethnic groups. Despite the heated discussions and controversies surrounding this issue, there has been essentially no attempt so far to quantify the relative power of ethnic groups and geography at predicting the proportion of shared alleles between human populations. Here, we present the first such quantification using a dataset of 51 populations typed at 377 microsatellite markers, and show that pair-wise geographic distances across landmasses constitute a far better predictor than ethnicity. Allele sharing between human populations decays smoothly with increasing physical distance at a worldwide scale. We discuss the relevance of those patterns for the expected distribution of variants of medical interest. The distribution patterns for genes coding for simple traits are expected to be highly heterogeneous, as most such genes experienced strong natural selection. However variants involved in complex traits are expected to behave essentially neutrally and we expect them to fit closely our predictions based on microsatellites. We conclude that the use of ethnicity alone will often be inadequate as a basis for medical treatment. ",Human genetics,POPGENE

This study aimed to clarify this matter. [Participants and Methods] Seventy-one male patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aged 72.2 ¬± 4.5‚ÄÖyears) participated in this study. We compared physical activity levels (determined as daily steps), presence or absence of daily routine (e.g., housework or hobby), 6-minute walking distance, psychological factors (using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and health-related quality of life (Physical and Mental component summary of the 36-item short-form health survey) between patients in different stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [Results] When examined at each stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, physical activity levels correlated with the presence or absence of daily routine, 6-minute walking distance, and Physical component summary in all stages, but the scores in the anxiety and depression components of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Mental component summary correlated only with stage 4. [Conclusion] Physical functioning was related to physical activity levels at any stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although psychological functioning was related to the progress of disease severity.

0.887050115,28694999,"Fusion of a superfamily 1 helicase and an inactivated DNA polymerase is a signature of common evolutionary history of Polintons, polinton-like viruses, Tlr1 transposons and transpovirons","Abstract Polintons (polintoviruses), polinton-like viruses (PLVs) and virophages belong to a recently described major class of eukaryotic viruses that is characterized by a distinct virion morphogenetic protein module and, in many members, a protein-primed family B DNA polymerase (pDNAP). All Polintons, by definition, encode a pDNAP and a retrovirus-like integrase. Most of the PLV lack these genes and instead encode a large protein containing a superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase domain. We show here that the SF1 helicase domain-containing proteins of the PLV also contain an inactivated pDNAP domain. This unique helicase-pDNAP fusion is also encoded by transpovirons, enigmatic plasmid-like genetic elements that are associated with giant viruses of the family Mimiviridae . These findings indicate the directionality of evolution of different groups of viruses and mobile elements in the Polinton-centered class. We propose that the PLV evolved from a polinton via fusion of the pDNAP gene with a helicase gene that was accompanied by mutations in the pDNAP active site, likely resulting in inactivation of the polymerase activity. The transpovirons could have evolved from PLV via the loss of several genes including those encoding the morphogenetic module proteins. These findings reaffirm the central evolutionary position of the Polintons in the evolution of eukaryotic viruses and other mobile genetic elements.",Virus evolution,IMMUN

Results The algorithm to perform a skeleton search was based on a reciprocal distance function grid that was developed and implemented for the CAVER program. The program identifies and visualizes routes from the interior of the protein to the bulk solvent.

The fully functional program is available as a stand-alone version and as plug-in for the molecular modeling program PyMol. Additionally, selected functions are accessible in an online version. Conclusion The algorithm developed automatically finds the path from a starting point located within the interior of a protein. The algorithm is sufficiently rapid and robust to enable routine analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories containing thousands of snapshots.

This study aimed to assess RSV seasonality among children ‚â§24 months of age in Taiwan. We also assessed factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with RSV-associated hospitalization in preterm infants to confirm the appropriateness of the novel Taiwanese RSV prophylactic policy. Study Design From January 2000 to August 2010, 3572 children aged ‚â§24-months were admitted to Taipei Mackay Memorial Hospital due to RSV infection. The monthly RSV-associated hospitalization rate among children aged ‚â§24 months was retrospectively reviewed. Among these children, 378 were born preterm. The associations between GA, CA, and BPD and the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization in the preterm infants were assessed. Results In children aged ‚â§24 months, the monthly distribution of RSV-associated hospitalization rates revealed a prolonged RSV season with a duration of 10 months. Infants with GAs ‚â§32 weeks and those who had BPD had the highest rates of RSV hospitalization ( P <0.001). Preterm infants were most vulnerable to RSV infection within CA 9 months. Conclusions Given that Taiwan has a prolonged (10-month) RSV season, the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations for RSV prophylaxis are not directly applicable. The current Taiwanese guidelines for RSV prophylaxis, which specify palivizumab injection (a total six doses until CA 8‚Äì9 months) for preterm infants (those born before 28 6/7 weeks GA or before 35 6/7 weeks GA with BPD), are appropriate.

Here we have developed HIPMap, a high-precision, high-throughput, automated fluorescent in situ hybridization imaging pipeline, for mapping of the spatial location of genome regions at large scale. High-throughput imaging position mapping (HIPMap) enabled an unbiased siRNA screen for factors involved in genome organization in human cells. We identify 50 cellular factors required for proper positioning of a set of functionally diverse genomic loci. Positioning factors include chromatin remodelers, histone modifiers and nuclear envelope and pore proteins. Components of the replication and post-replication chromatin re-assembly machinery are prominently represented amongst positioning factors and timely progression of cells through replication, but not mitosis, is required for correct gene positioning. Our results establish a method for the large scale mapping of genome locations and have led to the identification of a compendium of cellular factors involved in spatial genome organization.

Torsional position of the eyes can impact perception of upright by changing orientation of the images on the retina relative to gravity. Here, we investigated the role of temporoparietal cortex in upright perception with respect to ocular torsion, by means of the inhibitory effect of continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We used a subjective visual vertical (SVV) paradigm to track changes in upright perception, and a custom video method to track ocular torsion simultaneously. Twelve participants were tested during a lateral head tilt of 20¬∞ to the left. TMS at the posterior aspect of the supramarginal gyrus (SMGp) resulted in an average SVV shift in the opposite direction of the head tilt compared to a sham stimulation (1.8¬∞). Ocular torsion following TMS at SMGp showed no significant change compared to the sham stimulation (‚àí0.1¬∞). Thus, changes in upright perception at SMGp were dissociated from ocular torsion. This finding suggests that perception of upright at SMGp is primarily related to sensory processing for spatial orientation, as opposed to subcortical regions that have direct influence on ocular torsion.",Frontiers in neurology,NEURO
0.198624467,15518209,Information Limits on Neural Identification of Colored Surfaces in Natural Scenes," If surfaces in a scene are to be distinguished by their color, their neural representation at some level should ideally vary little with the color of the illumination. Four possible neural codes were considered: von-Kries-scaled cone responses from single points in a scene, spatial ratios of cone responses produced by light reflected from pairs of points, and these quantities obtained with sharpened (opponent-cone) responses. The effectiveness of these codes in identifying surfaces was quantified by information-theoretic measures. Data were drawn from a sample of 25 rural and urban scenes imaged with a hyperspectral camera, which provided estimates of surface reflectance at 10-nm intervals at each of 1344 √ó 1024 pixels for each scene. In computer simulations, scenes were illuminated separately by daylights of correlated color temperatures 4000 K, 6500 K, and 25,000 K. Points were sampled randomly in each scene and identified according to each of the codes. It was found that the maximum information preserved under illuminant changes varied with the code, but for a particular code it was remarkably stable across the different scenes. The standard deviation over the 25 scenes was, on average, approximately 1 bit, suggesting that the neural coding of surface color can be optimized independent of location for any particular range of illuminants.

0.5659416,16305748,Do proxies reflect patients' health concerns about urinary incontinence and gait problems?,"Background While falls and urinary incontinence are prevalent among older patients, who sometimes rely on proxies to provide their health information, the validity of proxy reports of concern about falls and urinary incontinence remains unknown. Methods Telephone interviews with 43 consecutive patients with falls or fear of falling and/or bothersome urinary incontinence and their proxies chosen by patients as most knowledgeable about their health. The questionnaire included items derived from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12 (SF-12), a scale assessing concerns about urinary incontinence (UI), and a measure of fear of falling, the Falls Efficacy Scale (FES). Scores were estimated using items asking the proxy perspective (6 items from the SF-12, 10 items from a UI scale, and all 10 FES items). Proxy and patient scores were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC, one-way model). Variables associated with absolute agreement between patients and proxies were explored. Results Patients had a mean age of 81 years (range 75‚Äì93) and 67% were female while proxies had a mean age of 70 (range 42‚Äì87) and 49% were female. ICCs were 0.63 for the SF-12, 0.52 for the UI scale, and 0.29 for the FES. Proxies tended to understate patients' general health and incontinence concern, but overstate patients' concern about falling. Proxies who lived with patients and those who more often see patients more closely reflected patient FES scores compared to those who lived apart or those who saw patients less often. Internal consistency reliability of proxy responses was 0.62 for the SF-12, 0.86 for the I-QOL, and 0.93 for the FES. In addition, construct validity of the proxy FES scale was supported by greater proxy-perceived fear of falling for patients who received medical care after a fall during the past 12 months (p < .05). Conclusion Caution should be exercised when using proxies as a source of information about older patients' health perceptions. Questions asking about proxies' views yield suboptimal agreement with patient responses. However, proxy scales of UI and fall concern are internally consistent and may provide valid independent information.",Health and quality of life outcomes,CLINIC

Evidence from the Reproductive Health Subaccounts in Mexico, 2003‚Äì2012","Objective To analyze whether the changes observed in the level and distribution of resources for maternal health and family planning (MHFP) programs from 2003 to 2012 were consistent with the financial goals of the related policies. Materials and Methods A longitudinal descriptive analysis of the Mexican Reproductive Health Subaccounts 2003‚Äì2012 was performed by financing scheme and health function. Financing schemes included social security, government schemes, household out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, and private insurance plans. Functions were preventive care, including family planning, antenatal and puerperium health services, normal and cesarean deliveries, and treatment of complications. Changes in the financial imbalance indicators covered by MHFP policy were tracked: (a) public and OOP expenditures as percentages of total MHFP spending; (b) public expenditure per woman of reproductive age (WoRA, 15‚Äì49 years) by financing scheme; (c) public expenditure on treating complications as a percentage of preventive care; and (d) public expenditure on WoRA at state level. Statistical analyses of trends and distributions were performed. Results Public expenditure on government schemes grew by approximately 300%, and the financial imbalance between populations covered by social security and government schemes decreased. The financial burden on households declined, particularly among households without social security. Expenditure on preventive care grew by 16%, narrowing the financing gap between treatment of complications and preventive care. Finally, public expenditure per WoRA for government schemes nearly doubled at the state level, although considerable disparities persist. Conclusions Changes in the level and distribution of MHFP funding from 2003 to 2012 were consistent with the relevant policy goals. However, improving efficiency requires further analysis to ascertain the impact of investments on health outcomes. This, in turn, will require better financial data systems as a precondition for improving the monitoring and accountability functions in Mexico.",PloS one,EPIDEM

This paper concentrates on the changing spatial distribution of an epidemic wave over time and presents a simple method for identifying the leading and trailing edges of the spatial advance and retreat of such waves. Analysis of edge characteristics is used to (a) disaggregate waves into ‚Äòswash‚Äô and ‚Äòbackwash‚Äô stages, (b) measure the phase transitions of areas from susceptible, S , through infective, I , to recovered, R , status ( S ‚Üí I ‚Üí R ) as dimensionless integrals and (c) estimate a spatial version of the basic reproduction number, R 0 . The methods used are illustrated by application to measles waves in Iceland over a 60-year period from 1915 to 1974. Extensions of the methods for use with more complex waves are possible through modifying the threshold values used to define the start and end points of an event.

We aimed to examine the effect of former (agricultural) land use type, inter-row spacing and genotype. Methods Annual SCE was quantified during the second growth year of the establishment rotation in a large scale poplar plantation in Flanders. Automated chambers were distributed over the two former land use types, the two different inter-row spacings and under two poplar genotypes. Additional measurements of C, N, P, K, Mg, Ca and Na concentrations of the soil, pH, bulk density, fine root biomass, microbial biomass C, soil mineralization rate, distance to trees and tree diameters were performed at the end of the second growth year. Results Total carbon loss from soil CO 2 efflux was valued at 589¬†g m ‚àí2 yr ‚àí1 . Annual SCE was higher in former pasture as compared to cropland, higher in the narrow than in the wider inter-row spacings, but no effect of genotype was found.

We hypothesized that the availability of interventional radiology (IR) for angioembolization may vary in spite of the mandated coverage at US Level I trauma centers, and that the priority treatment sequence would depend on IR availability. Methods This survey was designed to investigate IR availability and pelvic fracture management practices. Six email invitations were sent to 158 trauma medical directors at Level I trauma centers. Participants were allowed to skip questions and irrelevant questions were skipped; therefore, not all questions were answered by all participants. The primary outcome was the priority treatment sequence for hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures. Predictor variables were arrival times for IR when working off-site and intervention preparation times. Kruskal-Wallis and ordinal logistic regression were used; alpha‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05. Results Forty of the 158 trauma medical directors responded to the survey (response rate: 25.3%). Roughly half of participants had 24-h on-site IR coverage, 24% (4/17) of participants reported an arrival time‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ31‚Äâmin when IR was on-call. 46% (17/37) of participants reported an IR procedure setup time of 31‚Äì120‚Äâmin. Arrival time when IR was working off-site, and intervention preparation time did not significantly affect the sequence priority of angioembolization for hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures.

Eight invertebrate taxa from four different orders were included in this study of mainland New Zealand and Chatham Islands lineages to explore outcomes of island colonization. These comprised two orthopteran genera, one an endemic forest-dwelling genus of cave weta (Rhaphidophoridae, Talitropsis ) and the other a grasshopper (Acrididae, Phaulacridum ) that inhabits open grassland; four genera of Coleoptera including carabid beetles ( Mecodema ), stag beetles ( Geodorcus ), weevils ( Hadramphus ) and clickbeetles ( Amychus ); the widespread earwig genus Anisolabis (Dermaptera) that is common on beaches in New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, and an endemic and widespread cockroach genus Celatoblatta (Blattodea). Mitochondrial DNA data were used to reconstruct phylogeographic hypotheses to compare among these taxa. Strikingly, despite a maximum age of the Chathams of ‚àº4 million years there is no concordance among these taxa, in the extent of genetic divergence and partitioning between Chatham and Mainland populations. Some Chatham lineages are represented by insular endemics and others by haplotypes shared with mainland populations. These diverse patterns suggest that combinations of intrinsic (taxon ecology) and extrinsic (extinction and dispersal) factors can result in apparently very different biogeographic outcomes.",Insects,ANIMAL

This paper presents a method for left-atrium wall segmentation by using a novel sophisticated mesh-generation strategy and graph cuts on a proper ordered graph. The mesh is part of a template/model that has an associated set of learned intensity features. When this mesh is overlaid onto a test image, it produces a set of costs on the graph vertices which eventually leads to an optimal segmentation. The novelty also lies in the construction of proper ordered graphs on complex shapes and for choosing among distinct classes of base shapes/meshes for automatic segmentation. We evaluate the proposed segmentation framework quantitatively on simulated and clinical cardiac MRI. ",Proceedings. IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging,CS
0.338227336,24795604,A cross-linguistic evaluation of script-specific effects on fMRI lateralization in late second language readers,"Behavioral and neuroimaging studies have provided evidence that reading is strongly left lateralized, and the degree of this pattern of functional lateralization can be indicative of reading competence. However, it remains unclear whether functional lateralization differs between the first (L1) and second (L2) languages in bilingual L2 readers. This question is particularly important when the particular script, or orthography, learned by the L2 readers is markedly different from their L1 script. In this study, we quantified functional lateralization in brain regions involved in visual word recognition for participants' L1 and L2 scripts, with a particular focus on the effects of L1‚ÄìL2 script differences in the visual complexity and orthographic depth of the script. Two different groups of late L2 learners participated in an fMRI experiment using a visual one-back matching task: L1 readers of Japanese who learnt to read alphabetic English and L1 readers of English who learnt to read both Japanese syllabic Kana and logographic Kanji. The results showed weaker leftward lateralization in the posterior lateral occipital complex (pLOC) for logographic Kanji compared with syllabic and alphabetic scripts in both L1 and L2 readers of Kanji. When both L1 and L2 scripts were non-logographic, where symbols are mapped onto sounds, functional lateralization did not significantly differ between L1 and L2 scripts in any region, in any group. Our findings indicate that weaker leftward lateralization for logographic reading reflects greater requirement of the right hemisphere for processing visually complex logographic Kanji symbols, irrespective of whether Kanji is the readers' L1 or L2, rather than characterizing additional cognitive efforts of L2 readers. Finally, brain-behavior analysis revealed that functional lateralization for L2 visual word processing predicted L2 reading competency.",Frontiers in human neuroscience,NEURO

Due to the short channel length, a high electric field of ~16 kV/m is easily generated in the paper channel using two 9 V batteries. The multilayer architecture also enables convenient reclamation and analysis of the sample after ITP focusing by simply opening the origami paper and cutting out the desired layers. We profiled the electric field in the origami paper channel during ITP experiments using a nonfocusing fluorescent tracer.

0.765274167,27066216,"HEXT, a software supporting tree-based screens for hybrid taxa in multilocus data sets, and an evaluation of the homoplasy excess test"," Summary     The homoplasy excess test (HET) is a tree-based screen for hybrid taxa in multilocus nuclear phylogenies. Homoplasy between a hybrid taxon and the clades containing the parental taxa reduces bootstrap support in the tree. The HET is based on the expectation that excluding the hybrid taxon from the data set increases the bootstrap support for the parental clades, whereas excluding non-hybrid taxa has little effect on statistical node support. To carry out a HET, bootstrap trees are calculated with taxon-jackknife data sets, that is excluding one taxon (species, population) at a time. Excess increase in bootstrap support for certain nodes upon exclusion of a particular taxon indicates the hybrid (the excluded taxon) and its parents (the clades with increased support).    We introduce a new software program, hext , which generates the taxon-jackknife data sets, runs the bootstrap tree calculations, and identifies excess bootstrap increases as outlier values in boxplot graphs. hext is written in r language and accepts binary data (0/1; e.g. AFLP) as well as co-dominant SNP and genotype data.    We demonstrate the usefulness of hext in large SNP data sets containing putative hybrids and their parents. For instance, using published data of the genus Vitis (~6,000 SNP loci), hext output supports V. √ó champinii as a hybrid between V. rupestris and V. mustangensis .    With simulated SNP and AFLP data sets, excess increases in bootstrap support were not always connected with the hybrid taxon (false positives), whereas the expected bootstrap signal failed to appear on several occasions (false negatives). Potential causes for both types of spurious results are discussed.    With both empirical and simulated data sets, the taxon-jackknife output generated by hext provided additional signatures of hybrid taxa, including changes in tree topology across trees, consistent effects of exclusions of the hybrid and the parent taxa, and moderate (rather than excessive) increases in bootstrap support. hext significantly facilitates the taxon-jackknife approach to hybrid taxon detection, even though the simple test for excess bootstrap increase may not reliably identify hybrid taxa in all applications.

0.367433628,29259113,Punishment diminishes the benefits of network reciprocity in social dilemma experiments,"Significance The evolution of cooperation has a formative role in human societies‚Äîcivilized life on Earth would be impossible without cooperation. However, it is unclear why cooperation would evolve in the first place because Darwinian selection favors selfish individuals. After struggling with this problem for >150 y, recent scientific breakthroughs have uncovered multiple cooperation-promoting mechanisms. We build on these breakthroughs by examining whether two widely known cooperation-promoting mechanisms‚Äînetwork reciprocity and costly punishment‚Äîcreate synergies in a social dilemma experiment. While network reciprocity fulfilled its expected role, costly punishment proved to be surprisingly ineffective in promoting cooperation. This ineffectiveness suggests that the rational response to punishment assumed in theoretical studies is overly stylized and needs reexamining. Network reciprocity has been widely advertised in theoretical studies as one of the basic cooperation-promoting mechanisms, but experimental evidence favoring this type of reciprocity was published only recently. When organized in an unchanging network of social contacts, human subjects cooperate provided the following strict condition is satisfied: The benefit of cooperation must outweigh the total cost of cooperating with all neighbors. In an attempt to relax this condition, we perform social dilemma experiments wherein network reciprocity is aided with another theoretically hypothesized cooperation-promoting mechanism‚Äîcostly punishment. The results reveal how networks promote and stabilize cooperation. This stabilizing effect is stronger in a smaller-size neighborhood, as expected from theory and experiments. Contrary to expectations, punishment diminishes the benefits of network reciprocity by lowering assortment, payoff per round, and award for cooperative behavior. This diminishing effect is stronger in a larger-size neighborhood. An immediate implication is that the psychological effects of enduring punishment override the rational response anticipated in quantitative models of cooperation in networks.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,PSYCH

Material and methods A retrospective analysis of patients urgently operated upon in our Division of General Surgery, because of large intestine perforation, from February 1993 to February 2013 has been made. Results were compared with a group of patients undergoing the elective surgery for colorectal cancer in the same time and Division. Results Intestinal perforation occurred more often in males (6.52% vs. 6.03%), patients with mucous component in histopathological examination (9.09% vs. 6.01%) and with clinicaly advanced CRC. Patients treated because of perforation had a five-fold higher 30 day mortality rate (9.09% vs. 1.83%), however long-term survival did not differ significantly in both groups. After resectional surgery in 874 patients an intestinal anastomosis was made. Anastomotic leakage was present in 23 (2.6%) patients.

Method We based our case definition on two laboratory tests, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR), and virus isolation and compared VEs based on these tests. In addition, VE was evaluated by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from outpatients who visited clinics with influenza-like illness (ILIs) in Hokkaido, Niigata, Gunma and Nagasaki prefectures. Results Among 713 children and adults enrolled in this study, 578 were influenza positive by RT PCR including, 392 influenza A and 186 influenza B, while 135 were tested negative controls. The adjusted VE by RT PCR for all ages against any influenza was low protection of 36.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1% to 58.6%), for influenza A was 30.0% (95% CI: ‚àí10.0% to 55.5%), and influenza B was moderate 50.2% (95% CI: 13.3% to 71.4%). Adjusted VE for virus isolation for A(H1N1)pdm09 was 37.1% (95% CI: 1.7% to 59.7%), Yamagata lineage 51.3% (95% CI: 6.4% to 74.7%) and Victoria lineage 21.3% (95% CI: ‚àí50.0% to 58.9%).

0.539068211,17367941,Identification of an immune-responsive mesolimbocortical serotonergic system: potential role in regulation of emotional behavior," Peripheral immune activation can have profound physiological and behavioral effects including induction of fever and sickness behavior. One mechanism through which immune activation or immunomodulation may affect physiology and behavior is via actions on brainstem neuromodulatory systems, such as serotonergic systems. We have found that peripheral immune activation with antigens derived from the nonpathogenic, saprophytic bacterium, Mycobacterium vaccae , activated a specific subset of serotonergic neurons in the interfascicular part of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRI) of mice, as measured by quantification of c-Fos expression following intratracheal (12 h) or subcutaneous (6 h) administration of heat-killed, ultrasonically disrupted M. vaccae , or heat-killed, intact M. vaccae , respectively. These effects were apparent after immune activation by M. vaccae or its components but not by ovalbumin, which induces a qualitatively different immune response. The effects of immune activation were associated with increases in serotonin metabolism within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, consistent with an effect of immune activation on mesolimbocortical serotonergic systems. The effects of M. vaccae administration on serotonergic systems were temporally associated with reductions in immobility in the forced swim test, consistent with the hypothesis that the stimulation of mesolimbocortical serotonergic systems by peripheral immune activation alters stress-related emotional behavior. These findings suggest that the immune-responsive subpopulation of serotonergic neurons in the DRI is likely to play an important role in the neural mechanisms underlying regulation of the physiological and pathophysiological responses to both acute and chronic immune activation, including regulation of mood during health and disease states. Together with previous studies, these findings also raise the possibility that immune stimulation activates a functionally and anatomically distinct subset of serotonergic neurons, different from the subset of serotonergic neurons activated by anxiogenic stimuli or uncontrollable stressors. Consequently, selective activation of specific subsets of serotonergic neurons may have distinct behavioral outcomes. ",Neuroscience,NEURO

Therapy requires the urgent use of atropine to reverse cholinergic excess, thereby improving respiratory function, heart rate, and blood pressure. We aimed to assess variation in textbook recommendations for early atropinisation and to see whether this variation affected time to stabilisation using model data from 22 severely poisoned patients seen in a Sri Lankan clinical trial.    Methods  We extracted prospectively recorded data on atropine requirements for 22 OP poisoned patients who required intubation but survived to discharge. We did a systematic search for textbook recommendations for initial atropinisation regimens. These regimens were then applied to data from the Sri Lankan patients.    Results  The patients required a mean of 23.4 mg (standard deviation 22.0, range 1-75 mg) atropine to clear the lungs, raise the pulse above 80bpm, and restore systolic blood pressure to more than 80 mmHg. Textbook recommendations varied markedly -atropinisation of an average patient, requiring the mean dose of 23.4mg, would have taken 8 to 1380 mins; atropinisation of a very ill patient, requiring 75mg, would have taken 25 to 4440 mins. Atropinisation was attained most rapidly with a regimen of increasing bolus doses after failure to respond to the previous bolus.    Conclusions  There is great variation in recommendations for atropinisation, with some regimens taking hours and even days to stabilise a patient. The guidelines are very flexible ‚Äì possibly appropriate for experienced emergency physicians or clinical toxicologists, but completely inappropriate for the inexperienced junior doctors who see most cases worldwide. We recommend that a consensus guideline be developed by appropriate organisations to bring order to this important part of OP therapy, while acknowledging the paucity of data to drive the guidelines.

In 2011, following heavy winter snowfall, two cities bordering two rivers in North Dakota, USA faced major flood threats. Flooding was foreseeable and predictable although the extent of risk was uncertain. One community, Fargo, situated in a shallow river basin, successfully mitigated and prevented flooding. For the other community, Minot, located in a deep river valley, prevention was not possible and downtown businesses and one-quarter of the homes were inundated, in the city‚Äôs worst flood on record. We aimed at contrasting the respective hazards, vulnerabilities, stressors, psychological risk factors, psychosocial consequences, and disaster risk reduction strategies under conditions where flood prevention was, and was not, possible. Methods . We applied the ‚Äútrauma signature analysis‚Äù (TSIG) approach to compare the hazard profiles, identify salient disaster stressors, document the key components of disaster risk reduction response, and examine indicators of community resilience. Results . Two demographically-comparable communities, Fargo and Minot, faced challenging river flood threats and exhibited effective coordination across community sectors. We examined the implementation of disaster risk reduction strategies in situations where coordinated citizen action was able to prevent disaster impact (hazard avoidance) compared to the more common scenario when unpreventable disaster strikes, causing destruction, harm, and distress. Across a range of indicators, it is clear that successful mitigation diminishes both physical and psychological impact, thereby reducing the trauma signature of the event. Conclusion . In contrast to experience of historic flooding in Minot, the city of Fargo succeeded in reducing the trauma signature by way of reducing risk through mitigation.",Disaster health,ENVIRON
0.27063179,19605637,"Responses to static visual images in macaque LGN: implications for adaptation, negative afterimages and visual fading"," Adaptation to static scenes is a familiar and fundamental aspect of visual perception that causes negative afterimages, fading, and many other visual illusions. To establish a foundation for understanding the neuronal bases of such phenomena and to constrain the contributions of retinal versus cortical processing, we studied the responses of neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) during and after the presentation of prolonged static visual stimuli. We found that parvocellular (P) cells (the more numerous and color-sensitive pathway) showed response adaptation with a time constant on the order of tens of seconds and that their response after the removal of a visual stimulus lasting 1 minute was similar in amplitude and time course to the response evoked by the photographic negative stimulus. Magnocellular (M) cells (the faster-conducting and achromatic pathway) had after-responses that were substantially weaker than responses evoked by patterned visual stimuli. This difference points to the existence of an adaptive mechanism in the P-pathway that is absent or impaired in the M-pathway and is inconsistent with full adaptation of photoreceptors, which feed both pathways. Cells in both pathways often maintained a substantial tonic response throughout 1 minute stimuli, suggesting that these major feedforward inputs to cortex adapt too slowly to account for visual fading. Our findings suggest that faster-adapting mechanisms in cortex are likely to be required to account for the time course of visual perception during and after prolonged static images.

Here, we use three species distribution models (SDMs) to evaluate projected shifts in habitat suitable for Tufted Puffin nesting for the year 2050 under two future Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios. Ensemble model results indicate warming marine and terrestrial temperatures play a key role in the loss of suitable Tufted Puffin nesting conditions in the California Current under both business-as-usual (RCP 8.5) and moderated (RCP 4.5) carbon emission scenarios, and in particular, that mean summer sea-surface temperatures greater than 15¬†¬∞C are likely to make habitat unsuitable for breeding. Under both emission scenarios, ensemble model results suggest that more than 92% of currently suitable nesting habitat in the California Current is likely to become unsuitable. Moreover, the models suggest a net loss of greater than 21% of suitable nesting sites throughout the entire North American range of the Tufted Puffin, regardless of emission-reduction strategies. These model results highlight continued Tufted Puffin declines‚Äîparticularly among southern breeding colonies‚Äîand indicate a significant risk of near-term extirpation in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem.",PeerJ,ANIMAL

Ten elite male judokas (age: 18.1 ¬± 1.7 years, athletic experience: 6 years with a training frequency of 6 Judo-sessions/week) performed three cycle ergometry sessions comprising a 30 s Wingate test (MAX), 30 min at 60% maximal-aerobic-power-output (LOW) or these two exercise protocols combined (COMBINED) in a repeated-measures design. Venous blood-samples were collected before, and 0(P0), 5(P5), 10(P10) and 20(P20) min after each exercise protocol and assessed for malondialdehyde concentration ([MDA]), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) content, and total-antioxidant-status (TAS). Plasma [MDA] was found to be increased above baseline at P0 and P5 in the MAX, LOW and COMBINED conditions ( p < 0.05), but was greater at P10 and P20 in the LOW condition compared to MAX and COMBINED conditions ( p < 0.05). Blood GPX and SOD content increased above baseline at P0 in MAX and COMBINED and at P5 in LOW ( p < 0.05), with GR content being similar between groups at P0 and P5 ( p > 0.05). 20 min post-exercise, GPX, SOD, GR content and TAS were lower in the MAX compared to the LOW and COMBINED conditions ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, the findings from this study reveal that redox-related biomarkers exhibited divergent response dynamics following different forms of exercise, which might have implications for understanding the mechanisms of exercise-induced skeletal muscle fatigue and adaptive remodeling.",Frontiers in physiology,PHYSIO
0.5915437,28620447,Photoelectrochemistry by Design: Tailoring the Nanoscale Structure of Pt/NiO Composites Leads to Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Performance,"Photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution is a promising avenue to store the energy of sunlight in the form of chemical bonds. The recent rapid development of new synthetic approaches enables the nanoscale engineering of semiconductor photoelectrodes, thus tailoring their physicochemical properties toward efficient H 2 formation. In this work, we carried out the parallel optimization of the morphological features of the semiconductor light absorber (NiO) and the cocatalyst (Pt). While nanoporous NiO films were obtained by electrochemical anodization, the monodisperse Pt nanoparticles were synthesized using wet chemical methods. The Pt/NiO nanocomposites were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, ED, TEM, cyclic voltammetry, photovoltammetry, EIS, etc. The relative enhancement of the photocurrent was demonstrated as a function of the nanoparticle size and loading. For mass-specific surface activity the smallest nanoparticles (2.0 and 4.8 nm) showed the best performance. After deconvoluting the trivial geometrical effects (stemming from the variation of Pt particle size and thus the electroactive surface area), however, the intermediate particle sizes (4.8 and 7.2 nm) were found to be optimal. Under optimized conditions, a 20-fold increase in the photocurrent (and thus the H 2 evolution rates) was observed for the nanostructured Pt/NiO composite, compared to the benchmark nanoparticulate NiO film.","The journal of physical chemistry.

0.216982353,19770051,3D mapping of somatotopic reorganization with small animal functional MRI," There are few in vivo noninvasive methods to study neuroplasticity in animal brains. Functional MRI (fMRI) has been developed for animal brain mapping, but few fMRI studies have analyzed functional alteration due to plasticity in animal models. One major limitation is that fMRI maps are characterized by statistical parametric mapping making the apparent boundary dependent on the statistical threshold used. Here, we developed a method to characterize the location of center-of-mass in fMRI maps that is shown not to be sensitive to statistical threshold. Utilizing centers-of-mass as anchor points to fit the spatial distribution of the BOLD response enabled quantitative group analysis of altered boundaries of functional somatosensory maps. This approach was used to study cortical reorganization in the rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) after sensory deprivation to the barrel cortex by follicle ablation (F.A.). FMRI demonstrated an enlarged nose S1 representation in the 3D somatotopic functional maps. This result clearly demonstrates that fMRI enables the spatial mapping of functional changes that can characterize multiple regions of S1 cortex and still be sensitive to changes due to plasticity.

Methods: Using the presently available data, a meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the genetic relationship between the GSTP1 rs1138272 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. Results: A total of 43 studies including 15,688 cases and 17,143 controls were recruited into our quantitative synthesis. In the overall population, we observed an increased risk of overall cancer cases, compared with unrelated controls, in the genetic models of allele T vs. allele C ( P -association = 0.007, OR = 1.17), carrier T vs. carrier C ( P -association = 0.035, OR = 1.11), TT vs. CC ( P -association = 0.002, OR = 1.45), TT vs. CC+CT ( P -association = 0.009, OR = 1.42), and CT+TT vs. CC ( P -association = 0.027, OR = 1.13). We detected similar positive results within the Asian population. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the incidence of cancer for Africans under all genetic models (all P -association < 0.05, OR > 1). When targeting the Caucasian population, we detected a positive association with the TT vs. CC and TT vs. CC+CT models in the ‚ÄúColorectal cancer‚Äù ( P -association < 0.05, OR < 1) and ‚ÄúHead and neck cancer‚Äù ( P -association < 0.05, OR > 1) subgroups.

Conclusion: The TT genotype of the GSTP1 rs1138272 polymorphism is likely related to the susceptibility to overall cancer in the Asian and African populations and, specifically, ‚ÄúColorectal‚Äù and ‚ÄúHead and neck‚Äù cancers in the Caucasian population. In addition, the CT genotype of the GSTP1 rs1138272 polymorphism may be linked to the risk of lung cancer in Caucasians.

0.416808557,30325459,Does lipidomic serum analysis support the assessment of digestive efficiency in chickens?,"ABSTRACT The increasing cost of conventional feedstuffs used in poultry diets has bolstered interest in genetic selection for digestive efficiency (DE) to improve the adaptation of the birds to various alternative feedstuffs. However, DE measurement through AMEn is time-consuming and constraining. To simplify selection for DE, the potential of serum composition to predict AMEn was evaluated based on 40 birds from two broiler lines (D+ and D‚àí) divergently selected on the fecal AMEn of a difficult-to-digest wheat-based diet. Differences in serum coloration were suspected between the two lines, and thus a spectrophotometric analysis was carried out, revealing a significant difference in absorption between 430¬†nm and 516¬†nm, corresponding to the signature of orange‚Äìred lipophilic pigments such as xanthophylls. To go further, the liposoluble fraction of the serum was explored for its lipidome by mass spectrometry. Discriminant analysis revealed that a pattern of 10 metabolites, including zeaxanthin/lutein, can explain 82% of the lipidomic differences between the two lines. Colorimetry combined with lipidomics studies confirmed the relationship between digestive efficiency and serum composition, which opens up new possibilities for using it as a quick and easy proxy of digestive efficiency.",Poultry science,ANIMAL
0.818481426,29757629,Signature of Antibody Domain-Exchange by Native Mass Spectrometry and Collision Induced Unfolding," The development of domain-exchanged antibodies offers a route to high affinity targeting to clustered multivalent epitopes, such as those associated with viral infections and many cancers. One strategy to generate these antibodies is to introduce mutations into target antibodies to drive domain-exchange using the only known naturally-occurring domain-exchanged anti-HIV IgG1 antibody, 2G12, as a template. Here, we show that domain-exchange can be sensitively monitored by ion-mobility mass spectrometry and gas-phase collision induced unfolding. Using native 2G12 and a mutated form that disrupts domain-exchange such that it has a canonical IgG1 architecture (2G12 I19R), we show that the two forms can be readily distinguished by their unfolding profiles. Importantly, the same signature of domain-exchange is observed for both intact antibody and isolated Fab fragments. The development of a mass spectrometric method to detect antibody domain-exchange will enable rapid screening and selection of candidate antibodies engineered to exhibit this and other unusual quaternary antibody architectures.

0.724325057,27422993,"A soybean quantitative trait locus that promotes flowering under long days is identified as  FT5a , a  FLOWERING LOCUS T  ortholog","Highlight We identified different expression levels of FT5a , an ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T , as the molecular basis of a quantitative trait locus that promotes flowering under long-day conditions in soybean. FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) is an important floral integrator whose functions are conserved across plant species. In soybean, two orthologs, FT2a and FT5a , play a major role in initiating flowering. Their expression in response to different photoperiods is controlled by allelic combinations at the maturity loci E1 to E4 , generating variation in flowering time among cultivars. We determined the molecular basis of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for flowering time in linkage group J (Chromosome 16). Fine-mapping delimited the QTL to a genomic region of 107kb that harbors FT5a . We detected 15 DNA polymorphisms between parents with the early-flowering ( ef ) and late-flowering ( lf ) alleles in the promoter region, an intron, and the 3‚Ä≤ untranslated region of FT5a , although the FT5a coding regions were identical. Transcript abundance of FT5a was higher in near-isogenic lines for ef than in those for lf , suggesting that different transcriptional activities or mRNA stability caused the flowering time difference. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling from re-sequencing data for 439 cultivated and wild soybean accessions indicated that ef is a rare haplotype that is distinct from common haplotypes including lf . The ef allele at FT5a may play an adaptive role at latitudes where early flowering is desirable.",Journal of experimental botany,ANIMAL

An effective method of mechanically anchoring the PEDOT within an Au nanorod (Au-nr) structure is reported and it is demonstrated that it provides enhanced adhesion and overall PEDOT layer stability. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) stress is used to investigate adhesion and stability of spin-cast and electrodeposited PEDOT. The Au-nr adhesion layer permits 10 000 CV cycles of coated PEDOT film in phosphate buffered saline solution without delamination nor significant change of the electrochemical impedance, whereas PEDOT coating film on planar Au electrodes delaminates at or below 1000 cycles. Under CV stress, spin-cast PEDOT on planar Au delaminates, whereas electroplated PEDOT on planar Au encounters surface leaching/decomposition. After 5 weeks of accelerated aging tests at 60 ¬∞C, the electrodeposited PEDOT/ Au-nr microelectrodes demonstrate a 92% channel survival compared to only 25% survival for spin-cast PEDOT on planar films. Furthermore, after a 10 week chronic implantation onto mouse barrel cortex, PEDOT/Au-nr microelectrodes do not exhibit delamination nor morphological changes, whereas the conventional PEDOT microelectrodes either partially or fully delaminate. Immunohistochemical evaluation demonstrates no or minimal response to the PEDOT implant. ",Advanced healthcare materials,ENG
0.779102101,30594150,An  APETALA1  ortholog affects plant architecture and seed yield component in oilseed rape ( Brassica napus  L.),"Background Increasing the productivity of rapeseed as one of the widely cultivated oil crops in the world is of upmost importance. As flowering time and plant architecture play a key role in the regulation of rapeseed yield, understanding the genetic mechanism underlying these traits can boost the rapeseed breeding. Meristem identity genes are known to have pleiotropic effects on plant architecture and seed yield in various crops. To understand the function of one of the meristem identity genes, APETALA1 ( AP1 ) in rapeseed, we performed phenotypic analysis of TILLING mutants under greenhouse conditions. Three stop codon mutant families carrying a mutation in Bna.AP1.A02 paralog were analyzed for different plant architecture and seed yield-related traits. Results It was evident that stop codon mutation in the K domain of Bna.AP1.A02 paralog caused significant changes in flower morphology as well as plant architecture related traits like plant height, branch height, and branch number. Furthermore, yield-related traits like seed yield per plant and number of seeds per plants were also significantly altered in the same mutant family. Apart from phenotypic changes, stop codon mutation in K domain of Bna.AP1.A02 paralog also altered the expression of putative downstream target genes like Bna.TFL1 and Bna.FUL in shoot apical meristem (SAM) of rapeseed. Mutant plants carrying stop codon mutations in the COOH domain of Bna.AP1.A02 paralog did not have a significant effect on plant architecture, yield-related traits or the expression of the downstream targets. Conclusions We found that Bna.AP1.A02 paralog has pleiotropic effect on plant architecture and yield-related traits in rapeseed. The allele we found in the current study with a beneficial effect on seed yield can be incorporated into rapeseed breeding pool to develop new varieties.

0.898553244,23954130,Group 3 Innate Lymphoid Cells Inhibit T-Cell-Mediated Intestinal Inflammation through Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling and Regulation of Microflora," SUMMARY  Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) is crucial for the maintenance and function of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), which are important in gut immunity. Because Ahr promotes T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation in vitro, it is reasonable to expect that Ahr would enhance Th17 cells in vivo. Instead, we show that Ahr deficiency caused increased intestinal Th17 cells, raising the possibility that group 3 ILCs could negatively regulate Th17 cells. Reduced innate interleukin-22 (IL-22) in Ahr -deficient mice allowed expansion of commensal segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), known to promote Th17 cells. Compared to Rorc +/+ Ahr ‚àí/‚àí mice, Rorc gfp/+ Ahr ‚àí/‚àí mice had further reduced group 3 ILCs and were prone to spontaneous colitis with increased SFB and Th17 cells. Innate expression of Ahr played a protective role in T-cell-mediated experimental colitis by suppressing pathogenic Th17 cells. Our data reveal an intricate balance between ILCs and Th17 cells regulated by Ahr and commensal flora. ",Immunity,IMMUN
0.587172988,31020313,A cytorhabdovirus phosphoprotein forms mobile inclusions trafficked on the actin/ER network for viral RNA synthesis,"Abstract As obligate parasites, plant viruses usually hijack host cytoskeletons for replication and movement. Rhabdoviruses are enveloped, negative-stranded RNA viruses that infect vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants, but the mechanisms of intracellular trafficking of plant rhabdovirus proteins are largely unknown. Here, we used Barley yellow striate mosaic virus (BYSMV), a plant cytorhabdovirus, as a model to investigate the effects of the actin cytoskeleton on viral intracellular movement and viral RNA synthesis in a mini-replicon (MR) system. The BYSMV P protein forms mobile inclusion bodies that are trafficked along the actin/endoplasmic reticulum network, and recruit the N and L proteins into viroplasm-like structures. Deletion analysis showed that the N terminal region (aa 43‚Äì55) and the remaining region (aa 56‚Äì295) of BYSMV P are essential for the mobility and formation of inclusions, respectively. Overexpression of myosin XI-K tails completely abolishes the trafficking activity of P bodies, and is accompanied by a significant reduction of viral MR RNA synthesis. These results suggest that BYSMV P contributes to the formation and trafficking of viroplasm-like structures along the ER/actin network driven by myosin XI-K. Thus, rhabdovirus P appears to be a dynamic hub protein for efficient recruitment of viral proteins, thereby promoting viral RNA synthesis. A cytorhabdovirus phosphoprotein forms mobile inclusion bodies that traffic along the actin/endoplasmic reticulum network in a process that is important for viral RNA synthesis.",Journal of experimental botany,ANIMAL
0.394520174,16933431,Reaching with alien limbs: Visual exposure to prosthetic hands in a mirror biases proprioception without accompanying illusions of ownership," In five experiments, we investigated the effects of visual exposure to a real hand, a rubber hand, or a wooden block on reaching movements made with the unseen left hand behind a parasagittal mirror. Participants reached from one of four starting positions, corresponding to four levels of conflict between the proprioceptively- and visually-specified position of the reaching hand. Reaching movements were affected most by exposure to the real hand, intermediately by the rubber hand, and least of all by the wooden block. When the posture and/or movement of the visible hand was incompatible with that of the reaching hand, the effect on reaching was reduced. A ‚Äòrubber hand illusion‚Äô questionnaire revealed that illusions of ownership of the rubber hand were not strongly correlated with reaching performance. This research suggests that proprioception recalibrates following visual exposure to prosthetic hands, and that this recalibration is independent of the rubber hand illusion.

We determined the age-related differences in performance and the gender differences for female and male half-Ironman triathletes of 6303 finishers (1115 women and 5188 men) at the Ironman 70.3 Switzerland in Rapperswil, Switzerland, from 2007 to 2010. Methods Analyses of variance were used to examine performance trends and differences between the genders. Results Gender differences in total event time were affected by age (F = 4.2; P < 0.001). Women achieved their best performance between 25 and 39 years whereas men attained their fastest race times between 18 and 39 years. The gender difference for ages 18‚Äì24 years was significantly ( P < 0.01) greater compared to older age groups (25‚Äì29 years and 40‚Äì44 years), and the gender difference for age groups 45‚Äì49 years and 50‚Äì54 years was significantly ( P < 0.01) greater than for those between the ages of 35‚Äì39 years. Conclusion The present data suggest that the fastest race time in a half-Ironman triathlon was achieved between the age of 25 and 39 years for women and between 18 and 39 years for men.

0.645205477,17460752,Focusing on fear: Attentional disengagement from emotional faces," Evidence suggests that anxiety is associated with a shift of visual attention toward threatening stimuli in the environment, such as facial expressions ( Mogg & Bradley, 1999 ). More recent evidence, however, indicates that anxiety may be better characterized by a failure to rapidly disengage the visual attention system away from threat-related facial expressions ( Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001 ). The present study further investigates this delayed disengagement hypothesis . Results show that high trait-anxious individuals, in contrast to low trait-anxious individuals, take longer to classify peripheral target letters when fearful facial expressions were presented at fixation relative to sad, happy, or neutral expressions. These findings demonstrate a specific tendency to dwell on fear-relevant stimuli, as opposed to negative information in general. These findings are considered from an evolutionary perspective and the possible role of delayed disengagement from threat in the maintenance of anxiety states is also discussed.

All batches, except for a 9.4-year-old batch, passed the potency test. Mass spectrometry (MS) and in-gel difference 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (DIGE) were used to examine antigens of the pellet and supernatant of AVP. The pellet contained proteins with a MW in excess of 15 kDa. DIGE of desorbed proteins from the pellet revealed that with aging, 19 spots showed a significant change in size or intensity, a sign of protein degradation. MS identified 21 proteins including protective antigen (PA), enolase, lethal factor (LF), nucleoside diphosphate kinase, edema factor, and S-layer proteins. Fifteen proteins were detected for the first time including metabolic enzymes, iron binding proteins, and manganese dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The supernatant contained131 peptide sequences. Peptides representing septum formation inhibitor protein and repeat domain protein were most abundant. Five proteins were shared with the pellet: 2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-6-dicarboxylate N-succinyltransferase, enolase, LF, MnSOD, and PA. The number of peptide sequences increased with age. Peptides from PA and LF appeared once batches exceeded their shelf life by 2 and 4 years, respectively.

0.888503066,30397125,Bronze Age population dynamics and the rise of dairy pastoralism on the eastern Eurasian steppe,"Significance Since the Bronze Age, pastoralism has been a dominant subsistence mode on the Western steppe, but the origins of this tradition on the Eastern steppe are poorly understood. Here we investigate a putative early pastoralist population in northern Mongolia and find that dairy production was established on the Eastern steppe by 1300 BCE. Milk proteins preserved in dental calculus indicate an early focus on Western domesticated ruminants rather than local species, but genetic ancestry analysis indicates minimal admixture with Western steppe herders, suggesting that dairy pastoralism was introduced through adoption by local hunter-gatherers rather than population replacement. Recent paleogenomic studies have shown that migrations of Western steppe herders (WSH) beginning in the Eneolithic (ca. 3300‚Äì2700 BCE) profoundly transformed the genes and cultures of Europe and central Asia. Compared with Europe, however, the eastern extent of this WSH expansion is not well defined. Here we present genomic and proteomic data from 22 directly dated Late Bronze Age burials putatively associated with early pastoralism in northern Mongolia (ca. 1380‚Äì975 BCE). Genome-wide analysis reveals that they are largely descended from a population represented by Early Bronze Age hunter-gatherers in the Baikal region, with only a limited contribution (‚àº7%) of WSH ancestry. At the same time, however, mass spectrometry analysis of dental calculus provides direct protein evidence of bovine, sheep, and goat milk consumption in seven of nine individuals. No individuals showed molecular evidence of lactase persistence, and only one individual exhibited evidence of >10% WSH ancestry, despite the presence of WSH populations in the nearby Altai-Sayan region for more than a millennium. Unlike the spread of Neolithic farming in Europe and the expansion of Bronze Age pastoralism on the Western steppe, our results indicate that ruminant dairy pastoralism was adopted on the Eastern steppe by local hunter-gatherers through a process of cultural transmission and minimal genetic exchange with outside groups.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,ECO
0.617966528,25705111,Trends of VOC exposures among a nationally representative sample: Analysis of the NHANES 1988 through 2004 data sets," Exposures to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are ubiquitous due to emissions from personal, commercial and industrial products, but quantitative and representative information regarding long term exposure trends is lacking. This study characterizes trends from1988 to 2004 for the 15 VOCs measured in blood in five cohorts of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a large and representative sample of U.S. adults. Trends were evaluated at various percentiles using linear quantile regression (QR) models, which were adjusted for solvent-related occupations and cotinine levels. Most VOCs showed decreasing trends at all quantiles, e.g., median exposures declined by 2.5 (m, p-xylene) to 6.4 (tetrachloroethene) percent per year over the 15 year period. Trends varied by VOC and quantile, and were grouped into three patterns: similar decreases at all quantiles (including benzene, toluene); most rapid decreases at upper quantiles (ethylbenzene, m, p-xylene, o-xylene, styrene, chloroform, tetrachloroethene); and fastest declines at central quantiles (1,4-dichlorobenzene). These patterns reflect changes in exposure sources, e.g., upper-percentile exposures may result mostly from occupational exposure, while lower percentile exposures arise from general environmental sources. Both VOC emissions aggregated at the national level and VOC concentrations measured in ambient air also have declined substantially over the study period and are supportive of the exposure trends, although the NHANES data suggest the importance of indoor sources and personal activities on VOC exposures. While piecewise QR models suggest that exposures of several VOCs decreased little or any during the 1990‚Äôs, followed by more rapid decreases from 1999 to 2004, questions are raised concerning the reliability of VOC data in several of the NHANES cohorts and its applicability as an exposure indicator, as demonstrated by the modest correlation between VOC levels in blood and personal air collected in the 1999/2000 cohort. Despite some limitations, the NHANES data provides a unique, long term and direct measurement of VOC exposures and trends. ","Atmospheric environment (Oxford, England : 1994)",ENVIRON

However, determining how quickly it takes place based on measurements of the relaxation dynamics of helical peptides is difficult because such relaxations invariably contain contributions from various structural transitions such as, from helical to non-helical states and helical to partial-helical conformations. Herein we measure the temperature-jump ( T -jump) relaxation kinetics of three model peptides that fold into a single-turn Œ±-helix, using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, aiming to provide a direct assessment of the helix nucleation rate. The Œ±-helical structure of these peptides is stabilized by a covalent cross-linker formed between the sidechains of two residues at the i and i +4 positions. If we assume that this cross-linker mimics the structural constraint arising from a strong sidechain-sidechain interaction (e.g., a salt-bridge) in proteins, these peptides would represent good models for studying the nucleation process of an Œ±-helix in a protein environment. Indeed, we find that the T -jump induced relaxation rate of these peptides is approximately (0.6 Œºs) ‚àí1 at room temperature, which is slower than that of commonly studied alanine-based helical peptides but faster than that of a naturally occurring Œ±-helix whose folded state is stabilized by a series of sidechain-sidechain interactions. Taken together, our results put an upper limit of about 1 Œºs for the helix nucleation time at 20 ¬∞C and suggest that the subsequent propagation steps occur with a time constant of about 240 ns.

0.165523576,28681149,Young Children‚Äôs Physiological Reactivity During Memory Recall: Associations with Posttraumatic Stress and Parent Physiological Synchrony," Autonomic reactivity is implicated in stress response and social engagement ‚Äì both key components of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ‚Äì but few studies have examined autonomic reactivity in pediatric samples, and no known studies have examined physiological synchrony among children with PTSD and caregivers. In a sample of 247 young children (94 girls, 153 boys), most (85%) of whom had exposure to trauma and 40% who met criteria for PTSD, we examined children‚Äôs patterns of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at baseline and in response to a memory recall task, as well as correspondence between parents‚Äô and children‚Äôs RSA. Children with PTSD demonstrated significantly higher reactivity than other groups during their recollection of a traumatic memory, but not during other memory tasks. Regarding synchrony, caregivers‚Äô and children‚Äôs RSA were more significantly and positively correlated during the trauma recall task among children who had had exposure to a potentially traumatic event but did not meet PTSD criteria, suggesting physiological synchrony may be protective in contexts of trauma. Overall, findings demonstrate physiological reactivity differences among young children with PTSD. While more work is needed to understand the meaning of parent-child physiological synchrony, these data suggest that children‚Äôs psychopathology is associated with physiological synchrony processes among young children with exposure to trauma.

0.70554507,28317113,Temperamental Markers in Toddlers with ASD,"  Background  Although temperament has been recognized as an important contributor to childhood psychopathology, its role in emergent autism spectrum phenotypes is not well-understood. This study examined whether toddlers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) display temperamental vulnerabilities compared to toddlers with other developmental challenges, whether these characteristics are distinct from core autism symptoms, if they are stable over time, and if they contribute to social outcomes in preschool.    Methods  Parents of 165 toddlers with ASD, 58 nonverbal ability- and chronological age- (CA) matched developmentally delayed (DD) toddlers and 92 CA-matched typically developing (TD) toddlers completed the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire-Supplemental (TBAQ-S) at 26 months ( SD =6; Time 1). TBAQ-S data were also available for a subset of toddlers with ASD ( n =126) at 43 months ( SD =9; Time 2).    Results  Compared to the DD and TD groups, toddlers with ASD exhibited vulnerabilities within the Effortful Control domain as well as the Surgency domain. They also displayed greater Negative Emotionality compared to TD peers. In the ASD group, temperamental characteristics were not concurrently related to autism severity or developmental level and individual differences were highly stable over time. Changes in Perceptual Sensitivity, Inhibitory Control, and Low-Intensity Pleasure from age 2 to 3 ¬Ω uniquely predicted autism symptom severity and adaptive social skill level at Time 2.    Conclusions  Temperamental vulnerabilities in toddlers with ASD are stable over time and involve attentional and behavioral control as well as affective reactivity. They contribute uniquely to social outcomes in preschool and are likely to signal risk for developing later maladaptive attentional, affective, and behavioral symptoms. Considering biologically-based dimensions may shed light on non-core facets of the early ASD phenotype that are potentially relevant to the emergence of comorbid conditions later in childhood.

0.580530784,22344477,"Ecological drivers of group living in two populations of the communally rearing rodent,  Octodon degus"," Intraspecific variation in sociality is thought to reflect a trade-off between current fitness benefits and costs that emerge from individuals' decision to join or leave groups. Since those benefits and costs may be influenced by ecological conditions, ecological variation remains a major, ultimate cause of intraspecific variation in sociality. Intraspecific comparisons of mammalian sociality across populations facing different environmental conditions have not provided a consistent relationship between ecological variation and group-living. Thus, we studied two populations of the communally rearing rodent Octodon degus to determine how co-variation between sociality and ecology supports alternative ecological causes of group living. In particular, we examined how variables linked to predation risk, thermal conditions, burrowing costs, and food availability predicted temporal and population variation in sociality. Our study revealed population and temporal variation in total group size and group composition that covaried with population and yearly differences in ecology. In particular, predation risk and burrowing costs are supported as drivers of this social variation in degus. Thermal differences, food quantity and quality were not significant predictors of social group size. In contrast to between populations, social variation within populations was largely uncoupled from ecological differences. ",Behavioral ecology and sociobiology,ECO
0.102485413,29233945,Resource limitation prevents the emergence of drug resistance by intensifying within-host competition,"Significance Antimicrobial drug resistance is set to kill millions in the coming decades. Finding new drugs is one solution, but might it also be possible to prevent the emergence of drug resistance in the first place? We show that the emergence of drug resistance can be prevented by reducing the availability of a nutrient for which drug-resistant parasites are especially hungry. Rather than killing parasites, this intervention works by harnessing ecological interactions: With resistant parasites struggling to replicate, susceptible parasites outcompete them before they can emerge. Since resource-limiting drugs can be rationally designed and do not need to be lethal, it may be easier to find them than new, traditional drugs. Slowing the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is essential if we are to continue to successfully treat infectious diseases. Whether a drug-resistant mutant grows to high densities, and so sickens the patient and spreads to new hosts, is determined by the competitive interactions it has with drug-susceptible pathogens within the host. Competitive interactions thus represent a good target for resistance management strategies. Using an in vivo model of malaria infection, we show that limiting a resource that is disproportionately required by resistant parasites retards the evolution of drug resistance by intensifying competitive interactions between susceptible and resistant parasites. Resource limitation prevented resistance emergence regardless of whether resistant mutants arose de novo or were experimentally added before drug treatment. Our work provides proof of principle that chemotherapy paired with an ‚Äúecological‚Äù intervention can slow the evolution of resistance to antimicrobial drugs, even when resistant pathogens are present at high frequencies. It also suggests that a broad range of previously untapped compounds could be used for treating infectious diseases.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,IMMUN

Characterization of virus proteins from patients with HCV has been retarded by the low virus titre in blood and limited availability of infected tissue. Here, the authors have identified a primary infection in a liver transplanted into an immunodeficient patient with chronic HCV. The patient required re-transplant and the infected liver, removed 6 weeks after the initial transplant, had a very high titre of HCV, 5 √ó 10 9 International Units (IU) per gram of liver. The density distribution of HCV in iodixanol gradients showed a peak at 1¬∑04 g ml ‚àí1 with 73 % of virus below 1¬∑08 g ml ‚àí1 . Full-length HCV RNA was detected by Northern blotting and the ratio between positive- and negative-strand HCV RNA was determined as 60. HCV was partially purified by precipitation with heparin/Mn 2+ and a single species of each of the three structural proteins, core, E1 and E2, was detected by Western blotting. The molecular mass of core was 20 kDa, which corresponds to the mature form from recombinant sources. The molecular mass of glycoprotein E1 was 31 kDa before and 21 kDa after deglycosylation with PNGase F or endoglycosidase H. Glycoprotein E2 was 62 kDa before and 36 kDa after deglycosylation, but E2-P7 was not detected. This was in contrast to recombinant sources of E2 which contain E2-P7.

However, the relative mutational contribution of these genes to PFM/CB and CRS is not known and information on genotype‚Äìphenotype correlations is incomplete. We analysed ALX4 and MSX2 in 11 new unrelated cases or families with PFM/CB, 181 cases of CRS, and a single family segregating a submicroscopic deletion of 11p11.2, including ALX4 . We explored the correlations between skull defect size and age, gene, and mutation type, and reviewed additional phenotypic manifestations. Four PFM cases had mutations in either ALX4 or MSX2 ; including previous families, we have identified six ALX4 and six MSX2 mutations, accounting for 11/13 familial, but only 1/6 sporadic cases. The deletion family confirms the delineation of a mental retardation locus to within 1.1 Mb region of 11p11.2. Overall, no significant size difference was found between ALX4- and MSX2- related skull defects, but the ALX4 mutation p.R218Q tends to result in persistent CB and is associated with anatomical abnormalities of the posterior fossa. We conclude that PFM caused by mutations in ALX4 and MSX2 have a similar prevalence and are usually clinically indistinguishable.

Methodology/Principal Findings DNA isolated from blood was genotyped on Illumina Hap300 arrays. PennCNV combined with visual evaluation of images generated by the Beadstudio program was used to determine deletion boundary definition of sufficient precision to discern independent events, with near-perfect concordance between parent and child in about 98% of the 399 events detected in the offspring; the remaining 7 deletions were considered de novo . We defined several genomic regions of very high deletion frequency (‚Äòhotspots‚Äô), usually of 0.4‚Äì0.6 Mb in length where independent rare deletions were found at frequencies of up to 100 fold higher than the average for the genome as a whole. Five of the 7 de novo deletions were in these hotspots. The same hotspots were also observed in three other studies on members of the QFP, those with schizophrenia, with endometriosis and those from a longevity cohort. Conclusions/Significance Nine of the 13 hotspots carry one gene (7 of which are very long), while the rest contain no known genes. All nine genes have been implicated in disease. The patterns of exon deletions support the proposed roles for some of these genes in human disease, such as NRXN1 and PARKIN , and suggest limited roles or no role at all, for others, including MACROD2 and CTNNA3 .

0.432673332,30102042,Interface Residues That Drive Allosteric Transitions Also Control the Assembly of L-Lactate Dehydrogenase," The allosteric enzyme, L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is activated by fructose 1,6-metaphosphate (FBP) to reduce pyruvate to lactate. The molecular details of the FBP-driven transition from the low affinity T state to the high affinity R state in LDH, a tetramer composed of identical subunits, are not known. The dynamics of the T ‚Üí R allosteric transition, investigated using Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the self-organized polymer (SOP) model, revealed that coordinated rotations of the subunits drive the T ‚Üí R transition. We used the structural perturbation method (SPM), which requires only the static structure, to identify the allostery wiring diagram (AWD), a network of residues that transmits signals across the tetramer, as LDH undergoes the T ‚Üí R transition. Interestingly, the residues that play a major role in the dynamics, which are predominantly localized at the interfaces, coincide with the AWD identified using the SPM. Although the allosteric pathways are highly heterogeneous, on the basis of our simulations, we surmise that predominantly the conformational changes in the T ‚Üí R transition start from the region near the active site, comprised of helix Œ± C, helix Œ± 1/2G, helix Œ± 3G, and helix Œ± 2F, and proceed to other structural units, thus completing the global motion. Brownian dynamics simulations of the tetramer assembly, triggered by a temperature quench from the fully disrupted conformations, show that the bottleneck for assembly is the formation of the correct orientational registry between the subunits, requiring contacts between the interface residues. Surprisingly, these residues are part of the AWD, which was identified using the SPM. Taken together, our results show that LDH, and perhaps other multidomain proteins, may have evolved to stabilize distinct states of allosteric enzymes using precisely the same AWD that also controls the functionally relevant allosteric transitions.

In 2008, Styczynski et al. discovered miscalculations in the clustering step of the matrix computation. Still, the RBLOSUM64 matrix based on the corrected BLOSUM code was reported to perform worse at a statistically significant level than the BLOSUM62. Here, we present a further correction of the (R)BLOSUM code and provide a thorough performance analysis of BLOSUM-, RBLOSUM- and the newly derived CorBLOSUM-type matrices. Thereby, we assess homology search performance of these matrix-types derived from three different BLOCKS databases on all versions of the ASTRAL20, ASTRAL40 and ASTRAL70 subsets resulting in 51 different benchmarks in total. Our analysis is focused on two of the most popular BLOSUM matrices ‚Äî BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Results Our study shows that fixing small errors in the BLOSUM code results in substantially different substitution matrices with a beneficial influence on homology search performance when compared to the original matrices. The CorBLOSUM matrices introduced here performed at least as good as their BLOSUM counterparts in ‚àº75 % of all test cases. On up-to-date ASTRAL databases BLOSUM matrices were even outperformed by CorBLOSUM matrices in more than 86 % of the times. In contrast to the study by Styczynski et al., the tested RBLOSUM matrices also outperformed the corresponding BLOSUM matrices in most of the cases. Comparing the CorBLOSUM with the RBLOSUM matrices revealed no general performance advantages for either on older ASTRAL releases. On up-to-date ASTRAL databases however CorBLOSUM matrices performed better than their RBLOSUM counterparts in ‚àº74 % of the test cases. Conclusions Our results imply that CorBLOSUM type matrices outperform the BLOSUM matrices on a statistically significant level in most of the cases, especially on up-to-date databases such as ASTRAL ‚â•2.01. Additionally, CorBLOSUM matrices are closer to those originally intended by Henikoff and Henikoff on a conceptual level. Hence, we encourage the usage of CorBLOSUM over (R)BLOSUM matrices for the task of homology search.

Extrusion is a process where feed is pressed through a die in order to create shapes and increase digestibility. Descriptive sensory analysis using a human panel found an increase in undesirable sensory attributes (e.g., oxidized oil, rancid) in extruded pet food over storage time, especially the one prepared from chicken by product meal without antioxidants. The small increase in oxidized and rancid aromas of BMBM samples did not affect pet owners‚Äô acceptability of the products. CPBM samples without antioxidants showed a notable increase in oxidized and rancid aroma over storage time and, thus, affected product acceptability negatively. This finding indicated that human sensory analysis can be used as a tool to track the changes of pet food characteristics due to storage, as well as estimate the shelf-life of the products. Abstract Pet foods are expected to have a shelf-life for 12 months or more. Sensory analysis can be used to determine changes in products and to estimate products‚Äô shelf-life. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate how increasing levels of oxidation in rendered protein meals used to produce extruded pet food affected the sensory properties and (2) determine the effect of shelf-life on pet owners‚Äô acceptability of extruded pet food diet formulated without the use of preservative. Pet food diets contained beef meat bone meal (BMBM) and chicken byproduct meal (CBPM) in which the oxidation was retarded with ethoxyquin, mixed tocopherols, or none at all, and then extruded into dry pet foods. These samples represented low, medium, and high oxidation levels, respectively. Samples were stored for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months at ambient temperature. Each time point, samples were evaluated by six highly trained descriptive panelists for sensory attributes related to oxidation. Samples without preservatives were chosen for the acceptability test, since the differences in sensory characteristics over storage time were more distinguishable in those samples. Pet owners evaluated samples for aroma, appearance and overall liking. Descriptive sensory analysis detected significant changes in oxidized-related sensory characteristics over storage time. However, the differences for CBPM samples were more pronounced and directional. The consumer study showed no differences in pet owners‚Äô acceptability for BMBM samples. However, the noticeable increase in aroma characteristics (rancid aroma 0.33‚Äì4.21) in CBPM samples over storage time did have a negative effect on consumer‚Äôs liking (overall liking 5.52‚Äì4.95).",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,ANIMAL

Methods: We reviewed 336 patients averaging 66.5 years of age undergoing initial average 4.7 level lumbar laminectomies with average 1.4 level noninstrumented fusions over an average 7.1-year period (range 2.0‚Äì16.5 years). Patients uniformly exhibited spinal stenosis, instability (Grade I [195 patients] or Grade II spondylolisthesis [67 patients]), disc herniations (154 patients), and/or synovial cysts (66 patients).

Conclusions: Only 9 (2.7%) of 336 patients required reoperations (including for ASD) consisting of multilevel laminectomies with noninstrumented fusions for recurrent/new stenosis even with instability; these older patients were not typically unstable, or were likely already fused, and did not require instrumentation.

However, a general understanding of what governs multicompartment micelle morphologies and polydispersity, and how to manipulate their hierarchical superstructures using straightforward concepts and readily accessible polymers remains unreached. Here we demonstrate how to create homogeneous multicompartment micelles with unprecedented structural control via the intermediate pre-assembly of subunits. This directed self-assembly leads to a step-wise reduction of the degree of conformational freedom and dynamics and avoids undesirable kinetic obstacles during the structure build-up. It yields a general concept for homogeneous populations of well-defined multicompartment micelles with precisely tunable patchiness, while using simple linear ABC triblock terpolymers. We further demonstrate control over the hierarchical step-growth polymerization of multicompartment micelles into micron-scale segmented supracolloidal polymers as an example of programmable mesoscale colloidal hierarchies via well-defined patchy nanoobjects.

Individuals with high and low levels of trait anxiety completed a modified Stroop task, which revealed an attentional bias for threat-related stimuli in anxious individuals. This group was significantly slower in naming the colour in which threat-related words were displayed compared to neutral words. In a subsequent free recall test for the words used in the modified Stroop task, anxious individuals recalled more threat-related words compared to low-anxious people. This difference was significant even when controlling for the false recall of items that had not been presented during study. These results support the view put forward by Russo, Fox, Bellinger, and Nguyen-Van-Tam (2001) that mood-congruent free recall bias in anxious individuals can be observed if the target material is encoded at a relatively shallow level. Moreover, contrary to Dowens and Calvo (2003) , the current results show that the memory advantage for threat-related information in anxious individuals is not a consequence of response bias.

For each family, exome sequence was augmented with high-density SNP-array data. We present a discussion of the theory and practical application of each analytic step and provide example data to illustrate our approach. The paper is designed to provide an analytic roadmap for variant analysis, thereby enabling a wide range of researchers and clinical genetics practitioners to perform direct analysis of HTS data for their patients and projects.

0.657712669,23312905,Engineering nanocages with polyglutamate domains for coupling to hydroxyapatite biomaterials and allograft bone," Hydroxyapatite (HA) is the principal constituent of bone mineral, and synthetic HA is widely used as a biomaterial for bone repair. Previous work has shown that polyglutamate domains bind selectively to HA and that these domains can be utilized to couple bioactive peptides onto many different HA-containing materials. In the current study we have adapted this technology to engineer polyglutamate domains into cargo-loaded nanocage structures derived from the P22 bacteriophage. P22 nanocages have demonstrated significant potential as a drug delivery system due to their stability, large capacity for loading with a diversity of proteins and other types of cargo, and ability to resist degradation by proteases. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to modify the primary coding sequence of the P22 coat protein to incorporate glutamate-rich regions. Relative to wild-type P22, the polyglutamate-modified nanocages (E2-P22) exhibited increased binding to ceramic HA disks, particulate HA and allograft bone. Furthermore, E2-P22 binding was HA selective, as evidenced by negligible binding of the nanocages to non-HA materials including polystyrene, agarose, and polycaprolactone (PCL). Taken together these results establish a new mechanism for the directed coupling of nanocage drug delivery systems to a variety of HA-containing materials commonly used in diverse bone therapies.

0.224609138,20003275,Researching the mental health needs of hard-to-reach groups: managing multiple sources of evidence,"Background Common mental health problems impose substantial challenges to patients, carers, and health care systems. A range of interventions have demonstrable efficacy in improving the lives of people experiencing such problems. However many people are disadvantaged, either because they are unable to access primary care, or because access does not lead to adequate help. New methods are needed to understand the problems of access and generate solutions. In this paper we describe our methodological approach to managing multiple and diverse sources of evidence, within a research programme to increase equity of access to high quality mental health services in primary care. Methods We began with a scoping review to identify the range and extent of relevant published material, and establish key concepts related to access. We then devised a strategy to collect - in parallel - evidence from six separate sources: a systematic review of published quantitative data on access-related studies; a meta-synthesis of published qualitative data on patient perspectives; dialogues with local stakeholders; a review of grey literature from statutory and voluntary service providers; secondary analysis of patient transcripts from previous qualitative studies; and primary data from interviews with service users and carers. We synthesised the findings from these diverse sources, made judgements on key emerging issues in relation to needs and services, and proposed a range of potential interventions. These proposals were debated and refined using iterative electronic and focus group consultation procedures involving international experts, local stakeholders and service users. Conclusions Our methods break new ground by generating and synthesising multiple sources of evidence, connecting scientific understanding with the perspectives of users, in order to develop innovative ways to meet the mental health needs of under-served groups.",BMC health services research,CLINIC
0.504421351,23530594,Steep clines within a highly permeable genome across a hybrid zone between two subspecies of the European rabbit," Maintenance of genetic distinction in the face of gene flow is an important aspect of the speciation process. Here, we provide a detailed spatial and genetic characterization of a hybrid zone between two subspecies of the European rabbit. We examined patterns of allele frequency change for 22 markers located on the autosomes, X-chromosome, Y-chromosome, and mtDNA in 1078 individuals sampled across the hybrid zone. While some loci revealed extremely wide clines ( w >=300 km) relative to an estimated dispersal of 1.95‚Äì4.22 km/generation, others showed abrupt transitions ( w ‚âà 10 km), indicating localized genomic regions of strong selection against introgression. The subset of loci showing steep clines had largely coincident centers and stepped changes in allele frequency that did not co-localize with any physical barrier or ecotone, suggesting that the rabbit hybrid zone is a tension zone. The steepest clines were for X and Y chromosome markers. Our results are consistent with previous inference based on DNA sequence variation of individuals sampled in allopatry in suggesting that a large proportion of each genome has escaped the overall barrier to gene flow in the middle of the hybrid zone. These results imply an old history of hybridization and high effective gene flow, and anticipate that isolation factors should often localize to small genomic regions. ",Molecular ecology,ECO
0.153306315,31076758,Birth-and-Death Evolution of the Fatty Acyl-CoA Reductase (FAR) Gene Family and Diversification of Cuticular Hydrocarbon Synthesis in  Drosophila,"Abstract The birth-and-death evolutionary model proposes that some members of a multigene family are phylogenetically stable and persist as a single copy over time, whereas other members are phylogenetically unstable and undergo frequent duplication and loss. Functional studies suggest that stable genes are likely to encode essential functions, whereas rapidly evolving genes reflect phenotypic differences in traits that diverge rapidly among species. One such class of rapidly diverging traits are insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), which play dual roles in chemical communications as short-range recognition pheromones as well as protecting the insect from desiccation. Insect CHCs diverge rapidly between related species leading to ecological adaptation and/or reproductive isolation. Because the CHC and essential fatty acid biosynthetic pathways share common genes, we hypothesized that genes involved in the synthesis of CHCs would be evolutionary unstable, whereas those involved in fatty acid-associated essential functions would be evolutionary stable. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the evolutionary history of the fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FARs) gene family that encodes enzymes in CHC synthesis. We compiled a unique data set of 200 FAR proteins across 12 Drosophila species. We uncovered a broad diversity in FAR content which is generated by gene duplications, subsequent gene losses, and alternative splicing. We also show that FARs expressed in oenocytes and presumably involved in CHC synthesis are more unstable than FARs from other tissues. Taken together, our study provides empirical evidence that a comparative approach investigating the birth-and-death evolution of gene families can identify candidate genes involved in rapidly diverging traits between species.",Genome biology and evolution,ECO

Objective To evaluate the correlation and reliability of cervical sagittal alignment parameters obtained from lateral cervical radiographs (XRs) compared with lateral whole-body stereoradiographs (SRs). Methods We evaluated adults with cervical deformity using both lateral XRs and lateral SRs obtained within 1‚Äâweek of each other between 2010 and 2014. XR and SR images were measured by two independent spine surgeons using the following sagittal alignment parameters: C2‚ÄìC7 sagittal Cobb angle (SCA), C2‚ÄìC7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), C1‚ÄìC7 translational distance (C1‚Äì7), T1 slope (T1-S), neck tilt (NT), and thoracic inlet angle (TIA). Pearson correlation and paired t test were used for statistical analysis, with intra- and interrater reliability analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results A total of 35 patients were included in the study. We found excellent intrarater reliability for all sagittal alignment parameters in both the XR and SR groups with ICC ranging from 0.799 to 0.994 for XR and 0.791 to 0.995 for SR. Interrater reliability was also excellent for all parameters except NT and TIA, which had fair reliability. We also found excellent correlations between XR and SR measurements for most sagittal alignment parameters; SCA, SVA, and C1‚ÄìC7 had r >‚Äâ0.90, and only NT had r <‚Äâ0.70. There was a significant difference between groups, with SR having lower measurements compared with XR for both SVA (0.68 cm lower, p <‚Äâ0.001) and C1‚ÄìC7 (1.02 cm lower, p <‚Äâ0.001). There were no differences between groups for SCA, T1-S, NT, and TIA. Conclusion Whole-body stereoradiography appears to be a viable alternative for measuring cervical sagittal alignment parameters compared with standard radiography. XR and SR demonstrated excellent correlation for most sagittal alignment parameters except NT. However, SR had significantly lower average SVA and C1‚ÄìC7 measurements than XR. The lower radiation exposure using single SR has to be weighed against its higher cost compared with XR.",Global spine journal,CLINIC
0.759398176,16546804,Harboring illnesses: On the association between disease and living conditions in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon," This research examined the association between the domestic built environment in a Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon, and the presence of illness among household members. Data on the domestic built environment, socio-demographics and health were collected in 860 households. The association between the presence of illness among household members and three environmental indices, namely infrastructure and services, housing conditions, and crowding was evaluated. These indices were based on a number of items that reflected the existing problems in the domestic built environment. The main finding was the positive association between poor housing conditions and the presence of illness among household members. Households with 8-15 housing problems were twice more likely to report the presence of illness than those with less than four housing problems (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.40-3.11). This research contributes to the understanding of the influence of the built environment on the health of a refugee population. ",International journal of environmental health research,ENVIRON
0.43088299,20411959,Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of DNA condensation by block copolymer and formation of core-corona structures," Coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the condensation of single polyanion chains with block copolymers composed of cationic and neutral blocks. The simulations are an effort to model complexes formed with DNA and cationic copolymers such as polyethylenimine- g -polyethylene glycol which have been used in gene delivery. The simulations reveal that increases in the cationic block length of the copolymer result in greater condensation of the polyanion. The ability of the complexes to form core-corona structures, with the neutral blocks of the copolymers forming a corona around a dense core formed from the charged beads is investigated. The core-corona structure is shown to be dependent on both condensation of the polyanion chain and the length of the neutral block of the copolymer. Increasing the length of the cationic and neutral blocks of the copolymer both result in improvement in the core-corona structure. The internal structure of the complex core is shown to be a function of the architecture of the copolymer. Complexes formed from linear diblock copolymers have homogeneous cores with similarly arranged cationic and anionic beads; however, complexes formed with star-shaped copolymers have a layered core structure, with anionic beads found in the center of the cores.

0.616254063,20160892,Inexact Matching of Ontology Graphs Using Expectation-Maximization," We present a new method for mapping ontology schemas that address similar domains. The problem of ontology matching is crucial since we are witnessing a decentralized development and publication of ontological data. We formulate the problem of inferring a match between two ontologies as a maximum likelihood problem, and solve it using the technique of expectation-maximization (EM). Specifically, we adopt directed graphs as our model for ontology schemas and use a generalized version of EM to arrive at a map between the nodes of the graphs. We exploit the structural, lexical and instance similarity between the graphs, and differ from the previous approaches in the way we utilize them to arrive at, a possibly inexact , match. Inexact matching is the process of finding a best possible match between the two graphs when exact matching is not possible or is computationally difficult. In order to scale the method to large ontologies, we identify the computational bottlenecks and adapt the generalized EM by using a memory bounded partitioning scheme. We provide comparative experimental results in support of our method on two well-known ontology alignment benchmarks and discuss their implications. ",Web semantics (Online),CS
0.718189073,31100915,Hair Cortisol in Sheltered Cows and Its Association with Other Welfare Indicators,"Simple Summary Hair cortisol concentrations are measured for the assessment of long-term stress in animals. The objective of this study was to assess the levels of stress in retired, abandoned and unproductive cows housed in traditional shelters through the measurement of their hair cortisol levels. The study further aimed to explore the association of the hair cortisol concentrations with other cow and resource-based welfare indicators. High hair cortisol levels were associated with dung lying in the sheds, low dry bulb temperature and shelters having little access to the yards. At the cow level, high hair cortisol levels were associated with injuries on the joints and body, dehydration, old age, and low body hair loss level. The study concluded that hair cortisol is an effective tool to assess stress levels in cows under field conditions. Abstract India, the country with the largest population of dairy cows in the world, has a policy of retiring abandoned and non-lactating cows in shelters, but the level of provision for their welfare in these shelters is unclear. Cows in 54 shelters across India were assessed for historic evidence of physiological stress, through determination of hair cortisol in 540 samples from 10 cows in each shelter by enzyme immunoassay. Animal-based and shelter resource-based welfare measures were recorded and correlations with the hair cortisol investigated by multivariable analysis. High hair cortisol concentrations were associated with dung in the lying area of the cowshed, a low dry bulb temperature there and little cow access to yards, as shelter-based variables. At a cow level, high hair cortisol concentrations were associated with dirty flanks, hock joint ulceration, carpal joint injuries, body lesions, dehydration, an empty rumen, old age, and low levels of body hair loss. Hair cortisol level promises to be an effective biomarker of stress in cows when conducting studies under field conditions.",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,ANIMAL
0.391560481,29479323,Latent Impulsivity Subtypes in Substance Use Disorders and Interactions with Internalizing and Externalizing Co-Occurring Disorders,"This study explored the clinical importance of latent impulsivity subtypes within a sample of individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) and high rates of co-occurring disorders (CODs) receiving residential treatment, aiming to assess the heterogeneity of the associations between SUDs and CODs across such impulsivity subtypes. The abbreviated Barratt impulsiveness scale was used to assess motor and cognitive (attentional and nonplanning) impulsivity, a structured interview for diagnosis of SUD and CODs, and other clinimetric measures for severity of substance use. Latent class analysis was conducted to extract subgroups of impulsivity subtypes and Poisson regression to analyze effects of interactions of classes by CODs on severity of substance use. 568 participants were evaluated. Results featured a four-class model as the best-fitted solution: overall high impulsivity (OHI); overall low impulsivity; high cognitive-low motor impulsivity; and moderate cognitive-low motor impulsivity (MC-LMI). OHI and MC-LMI concentrated on most of the individuals with CODs, and individuals within OHI and MC-LMI showed more severity of substance use. The expression of this severity relative to the impulsivity subtypes was modified by their interaction with internalizing and externalizing CODs in very heterogeneous ways. Our findings suggest that knowing either the presence of trait-based subtypes or CODs in individuals with SUDs is not enough to characterize clinical outcomes, and that the analysis of interactions between psychiatric categories and behavioral traits is necessary to better understand the expressions of psychiatric disorders.",Frontiers in psychiatry,PSYCH

0.729086811,29123497,Leadership and Presenteeism among Scientific Staff: The Role of Accumulation of Work and Time Pressure,"The present study examines the joint roles of leadership and stressors for presenteeism of scientific staff. Leaders may have an impact on employees' health, both directly through interpersonal interactions and by shaping their working conditions. In the field of science, this impact could be special because of the mentoring relationships between the employees (e.g., PhD students) and their supervisors (e.g., professors). Based on the job demands-resources framework (JD-R), we hypothesized that the pressure to be present at the workplace induced by supervisors (supervisorial pressure) is directly related to employees' presenteeism as well as indirectly via perceptions of time pressure. The conservation of resources theory (COR) states that resource loss resulting from having to deal with job demands weakens the resource pool and therefore the capacity to deal with other job demands. Thus, we hypothesized that accumulation of work moderates the relationship between supervisorial pressure and time pressure, such that the relationship is stronger when accumulation of work is high compared to if accumulation of work is low. Cross-sectional data were obtained from 212 PhD students and postdocs of 30 scientific institutions in Germany. Analysis was performed using the SPSS macro PROCESS (Hayes, 2013 ). Supervisorial pressure was directly associated with higher presenteeism of employees and indirectly through increased time pressure. Moreover, supervisorial pressure and accumulation of work interacted to predict time pressure, but in an unexpected way. The positive relationship between supervisorial pressure and time pressure is stronger when accumulation is low compared to if accumulation of work is high. It seems possible that job stressors do not accumulate but substitute each other. Threshold models might explain the findings. Moreover, specific patterns of interacting job demands for scientific staff should be considered in absence management.",Frontiers in psychology,PSYCH
0.678833511,30546292,Heritability and genetic architecture of reproduction-related traits in a temperate oak species," Reproduction, one of the main components of plant fitness, is highly variable in response to environmental cues, but little is known about the genetic determinism underlying reproduction-related traits in forest tree species. There is therefore an urgent need to characterize the genetic architecture of those traits if we are to predict the evolutionary trajectories of forest populations facing rapidly changing environment and mitigate their impacts. Using a full-sib family of pedunculate oak ( Quercus robur ), we investigated the within population variability of seed production and mean seed mass during four consecutive years. Reproductive traits were highly variable between trees and between years. The high narrow sense heritability and evolvability estimated underline the important genetic effect on the variability in seed production and mean seed mass. Despite a large variability over years, reproductive traits show significant genetic correlation between years. Furthermore, for the first time in forest tree species, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seed production and mean mass of a seed have been identified. While it is commonly assumed and observed that fitness-traits have low narrow sense heritabilities, our findings show that reproduction-related traits may undergo evolutionary changes under selective pressure and may be determinant for tree adaptation.

However, the implementation of these solutions in hospitals is still difficult due to high costs, extremely expensive industrial-grade printers, and software that is difficult to obtain and learn along with a lack of a defined process. This paper presents a cost-effective technique of preparing 3D-printed liver models that preserves the shape and all of the structures, including the vessels and the tumor, which in the present case is colorectal liver metastasis. Methods The patient‚Äôs computed tomography scans were used for the separation and visualization of virtual 3D anatomical structures. Those elements were transformed into stereolithographic files and subsequently printed on a desktop 3D printer. The multipart structure was assembled and filled with silicone. The patient underwent subsequent laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy. The entire process is described step-by-step, and only free-to-use and mostly open-source software was used. Results As a result, a transparent, full-sized liver model with visible vessels and colorectal metastasis was created for under $150, which‚Äîtaking into account 3D printer prices‚Äîis much cheaper than models presented in previous research papers.

0.951700282,30994872,Association of Rare Copy Number Variants With Risk of Depression,"Key Points Question Are rare copy number variants associated with depression in a large population sample? Findings In this case-control study of 407‚Äâ074 individuals in the UK Biobank study, neurodevelopmental disorder copy number variants appear to be associated with the risk of depression in those without neurodevelopmental disorders. Physical health, educational attainment, social deprivation, smoking status, and alcohol consumption are variables that partially explain this association, and no evidence was found of an association between measures of copy number variant burden and depression. Meaning Neurodevelopmental copy number variants appear to be associated with increases in the risk of depression in those without neurodevelopmental disorders. Importance The role of large, rare copy number variants (CNVs) in neuropsychiatric disorders is well established, but their association with common psychiatric disorders, such as depression, remains unclear. Objective To examine the association of a group of 53 CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and burden of rare CNVs with risk of depression. Design, Setting, and Participants This case-control study used data from the UK Biobank study sample, which comprised 502‚Äâ534 individuals living in the United Kingdom. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar affective disorder diagnoses were excluded. Analyses were further restricted to individuals of European genetic ancestry (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ407 074). The study was conducted from January 2017 to September 2018. Exposures CNV carrier status. Main Outcomes and Measures For the primary outcome, individuals who reported that a physician had told them they had a depression diagnosis were defined as cases. Analyses were repeated using 2 alternative depression definitions: self-reported lifetime depression with current antidepressant prescription at the time of visit 1, and hospital discharge diagnosis of depression. Results Copy number variants were identified in 488‚Äâ366 individuals aged 37 to 73 years. In total, 407 074 individuals with European genetic ancestry (220‚Äâ201 female [54.1%]; mean [SD] age of 56.9 [8.0] years) were included in the study. Of these individuals, 23‚Äâ979 (5.9%) had self-reported lifetime depression and 383‚Äâ095 (94.1%) reported no lifetime depression. The group of 53 neurodevelopmental CNVs was associated with self-reported depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.19-1.49, uncorrected P =‚Äâ1.38‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10 ‚àí7 ), and these results were consistent when using 2 alternative definitions of depression. This association was partially explained by physical health, educational attainment, social deprivation, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. A strong independent association remained between the neurodevelopmental CNVs and depression in analyses that incorporated these other measures (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.11-1.43; P =‚Äâ2.87‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10 ‚àí4 ). Eight individual CNVs were nominally associated with risk of depression, and 3 of these 8 CNVs (1q21.1 duplication, Prader-Willi syndrome duplication, and 16p11.2 duplication) survived Bonferroni correction for the 53 CNVs tested. After the exclusion of carriers of neurodevelopmental CNVs, no association was found between measures of CNV burden and depression. Conclusions and Relevance Neurodevelopmental CNVs appear to be associated with depression, extending the spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are associated with CNV carrier status.

0.173174262,25142819,Sex differences in ventricular‚Äìvascular coupling following endurance training,"Introduction Ventricular and vascular coupling is defined as the ratio of arterial elastance (Ea) to ventricular elastance (Elv) and describes the interaction between the heart and arterial system. There are sex differences in both arterial and ventricular function in response to both acute exercise and aerobic exercise training. Purpose To examine the effects of aerobic exercise training on elastances and the coupling ratio in young adult men and women. We hypothesized a reduction in the coupling ratio in both sexes due to a decrease in Ea that would be more pronounced in men and an increase in Elv that would be larger in women. Methods Fifty-three healthy, young adults completed the study. Central pulse wave velocity and heart volumes were measured before and after an 8-week aerobic training intervention. Elastances were calculated as Ea¬†=¬†end-systolic pressure/stroke volume and Elv¬†=¬†end-systolic pressure/end-systolic volume and indexed to body surface area. Results After the intervention, women augmented indexed and un-indexed Elv from 2.09¬†¬±¬†0.61 to 2.52¬†¬±¬†0.80¬†mmHg/ml, p <¬†0.05, and reduced the coupling ratio from 0.72¬†¬±¬†18 to 0.62¬†¬±¬†15, p <¬†0.05, while men maintained their pre-training ratio (from 0.66¬†¬±¬†0.20 to 0.74¬†¬±¬†0.21, p >¬†0.05).

Of these, 4865 routine data audit (DA) inspections were analyzed: 401 from clinical trials performed in Western Europe, 230 in CEE, 3858 in the USA, and 376 in other countries. The average number of deficiencies per inspection ranged between 0.99 for CEE and 1.97 in Western Europe. No deficiencies were noted during 16.6%, 39.0%, and 21.5% of the inspections in Western Europe, CEE and USA, respectively. The percentages of inspections after which no follow-up action was indicated were 36.9% for Western Europe, 55.7% for CEE, and 44.3% for US sites. CEE was also the region with the lowest percentage of inspections that required official or voluntary action. On the basis of FDA inspection data, the high productivity of CEE sites appears to be accompanied by regulatory compliance as well as by data quality standards that are not inferior to those in Western regions.","Drug design, development and therapy",EPIDEM

We report the results from an experiment ( N = 51) that applied a procedure where the to-be-solved problems were 32 short (15 s) video recordings of magic tricks. The procedure included metacognitive ratings similar to the ‚Äúwarmth ratings‚Äù previously used by Metcalfe and colleagues, as well as confidence ratings. At regular intervals during problem solving, participants indicated the perceived closeness to the correct solution. Participants also indicated directly whether each problem was solved by insight or not. Problems that people claimed were solved by insight were characterized by higher accuracy and higher confidence than noninsight solutions. There was no difference between the two types of solution in warmth ratings, however. Confidence ratings were more strongly associated with solution accuracy for noninsight than insight trials. Moreover, for insight trials the participants were more likely to repeat their incorrect solutions on a subsequent recognition test. The results have implications for understanding people's metacognitive awareness of the cognitive processes involved in problem solving. They also have general implications for our understanding of how intuition and insight are related.",Frontiers in psychology,PSYCH
0.709364264,23266704,Resolving multi-molecular protein interactions by photoactivated localization microscopy," Multi-molecular protein complexes are critical to many cellular functions, including signaling, DNA transcription and enzymatic reactions. In spite of their importance, current research techniques such as biochemistry and diffraction-limited microscopy cannot resolve the heterogeneity and nanoscale organization of protein complexes in intact cells. Here we describe a technique that enables the study of multi-molecular protein complexes at the single molecule level in intact cells. The technique uses photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) to resolve individual proteins with a resolution down to 20nm in intact cells, and second-order statistics to study the spatial interactions of the proteins. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique by studying signaling complexes that form in activated T cells. We first use single color PALM imaging and univariate second-order statistics to resolve the clustering of Linker for Activation of T cells (LAT) at the plasma membrane (PM) of the cells. We then use two color PALM and bivariate second-order statistics to resolve the interaction of LAT with key interacting proteins. We discuss potential caveats in studying molecular clustering and the robustness of the technique to study bimolecular interactions. Our proposed technique, combined with older techniques, could help shed new light on the nature of multimolecular protein complexes and their significance to cell function.

0.096079482,23418020,Combined NGS Approaches Identify Mutations in the Intraflagellar Transport Gene  IFT140  in Skeletal Ciliopathies with Early Progressive Kidney Disease," Ciliopathies are genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by variable expressivity and overlaps between different disease entities. This is exemplified by the short rib-polydactyly syndromes, Jeune, Sensenbrenner, and Mainzer-Saldino chondrodysplasia syndromes. These three syndromes are frequently caused by mutations in intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes affecting the primary cilia, which play a crucial role in skeletal and chondral development. Here, we identified mutations in IFT140 , an IFT complex A gene, in five Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) and two Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MSS) families, by screening a cohort of 66 JATD/MSS patients using whole exome sequencing and targeted resequencing of a customized ciliopathy gene panel. We also found an enrichment of rare IFT140 alleles in JATD compared with nonciliopathy diseases, implying putative modifier effects for certain alleles. IFT140 patients presented with mild chest narrowing, but all had end-stage renal failure under 13 years of age and retinal dystrophy when examined for ocular dysfunction. This is consistent with the severe cystic phenotype of Ift140 conditional knockout mice, and the higher level of Ift140 expression in kidney and retina compared with the skeleton at E15.5 in the mouse. IFT140 is therefore a major cause of cono-renal syndromes (JATD and MSS). The present study strengthens the rationale for IFT140 screening in skeletal ciliopathy spectrum patients that have kidney disease and/or retinal dystrophy. ",Human mutation,POPGENE
0.753809264,28192233,Use of Ontology Structure and Bayesian Models to Aid the Crowdsourcing of ICD-11 Sanctioning Rules," The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the de facto standard international classification for mortality reporting and for many epidemiological, clinical, and financial use cases. The next version of ICD, ICD-11, will be submitted for approval by the World Health Assembly in 2018. Unlike previous versions of ICD, where coders mostly select single codes from pre-enumerated disease and disorder codes, ICD-11 coding will allow extensive use of multiple codes to give more detailed disease descriptions. For example, ‚Äúsevere malignant neoplasms of left breast‚Äù may be coded using the combination of a ‚Äústem code‚Äù (e.g., code for malignant neoplasms of breast) with a variety of ‚Äúextension codes‚Äù (e.g., codes for laterality and severity). The use of multiple codes (a process called post-coordination), while avoiding the pitfall of having to pre-enumerate vast number of possible disease and qualifier combinations, risks the creation of meaningless expressions that combine stem codes with inappropriate qualifiers. To prevent that from happening, ‚Äúsanctioning rules‚Äù that define legal combinations are necessary. In this work, we developed a crowdsourcing method for obtaining sanctioning rules for the post-coordination of concepts in ICD-11. Our method utilized the hierarchical structures in the domain to improve the accuracy of the sanctioning rules and to lower the crowdsourcing cost. We used Bayesian networks to model crowd workers‚Äô skills, the accuracy of their responses, and our confidence in the acquired sanctioning rules. We applied reinforcement learning to develop an agent that constantly adjusted the confidence cutoffs during the crowdsourcing process to maximize the overall quality of sanctioning rules under a fixed budget. Finally, we performed formative evaluations using a skin-disease branch of the draft ICD-11 and demonstrated that the crowd-sourced sanctioning rules replicated those defined by an expert dermatologist with high precision and recall. This work demonstrated that a crowdsourcing approach could offer a reasonably efficient method for generating a first draft of sanctioning rules that subject matter experts could verify and edit, thus relieving them of the tedium and cost of formulating the initial set of rules.

0.498508432,17637668,The effect of ancient population bottlenecks on human phenotypic variation," The origin and patterns of dispersal of anatomically modern humans are the focus of considerable debate 1 - 3 . Global genetic analyses have argued for one single origin, placed somewhere in Africa 4 - 7 . This scenario implies a rapid expansion, with a series of bottlenecks of small amplitude, which would have led to the observed smooth loss of genetic diversity with increasing distance from Africa. Analyses of cranial data, on the other hand, have given mixed results 8 - 12 , and have been argued to support multiple origins of modern humans 2 , 9 , 12 . Using a large dataset of skull measurements and an analytical framework equivalent to the one used for genetic data, we show that the loss in genetic diversity has been mirrored by a loss in phenotypic variability. We find evidence for an African origin, placed somewhere in the central/southern part of the continent, which harbours the highest intra-population diversity in phenotypic traits. We failed to find evidence for a second origin and confirm these results on a large genetic dataset. Distance from Africa accounts for an average 19% - 25% of heritable variation in craniometric traits, a remarkably strong effect for phenotypic traits known to be under selection. ",Nature,POPGENE
0.427953956,31058275,Locality Adaptive Multi-modality GANs for High-Quality PET Image Synthesis," Positron emission topography (PET) has been substantially used in recent years. To minimize the potential health risks caused by the tracer radiation inherent to PET scans, it is of great interest to synthesize the high-quality full-dose PET image from the low-dose one to reduce the radiation exposure while maintaining the image quality. In this paper, we propose a locality adaptive multi-modality generative adversarial networks model (LA-GANs) to synthesize the full-dose PET image from both the low-dose one and the accompanying T1-weighted MRI to incorporate anatomical information for better PET image synthesis. This paper has the following contributions. First, we propose a new mechanism to fuse multi-modality information in deep neural networks. Different from the traditional methods that treat each image modality as an input channel and apply the same kernel to convolute the whole image, we argue that the contributions of different modalities could vary at different image locations, and therefore a unified kernel for a whole image is not appropriate. To address this issue, we propose a method that is locality adaptive for multimodality fusion. Second, to learn this locality adaptive fusion, we utilize 1 √ó 1 √ó 1 kernel so that the number of additional parameters incurred by our method is kept minimum. This also naturally produces a fused image which acts as a pseudo input for the subsequent learning stages. Third, the proposed locality adaptive fusion mechanism is learned jointly with the PET image synthesis in an end-to-end trained 3D conditional GANs model developed by us. Our 3D GANs model generates high quality PET images by employing large-sized image patches and hierarchical features. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional multi-modality fusion methods used in deep networks, as well as the state-of-the-art PET estimation approaches.

Patients included 51 adults with unipolar depression who completed treatment trials using either fluoxetine, venlafaxine or placebo. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and single electrodes data were recorded at baseline, 2, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days. Patients were classified as medication and placebo responders or non-responders. CART analysis of HAM-D scores showed that patients with HAM-D scores lower than 13 by day 7 were more likely to be treatment responders to fluoxetine or venlafaxine compared to non-responders (p=0.001). Youden‚Äôs index Œ≥ revealed that CART models using QEEG measures were more accurate than HAM-D-based models. For patients given fluoxetine, patients with a decrease at day 2 in Œ∏ cordance at AF2 were classified by CART as treatment responders (p=0.02). For those receiving venlafaxine, CART identified a decrease in Œ¥ absolute power at day 7 at the PO2 region as characterizing treatment responders (p=0.01). Using all patients receiving medication, CART identified a decrease in Œ¥ absolute power at day 2 in the FP1 region as characteristic of nonresponse to medication (p=0.003). Optimal trees from the QEEG CART analysis primarily utilized cordance values, but also incorporated some Œ¥ absolute power values.

0.660428515,17570861,Bayesian approaches to reverse engineer cellular systems: a simulation study on nonlinear Gaussian networks,"Background Reverse engineering cellular networks is currently one of the most challenging problems in systems biology. Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) seem to be particularly suitable for inferring relationships between cellular variables from the analysis of time series measurements of mRNA or protein concentrations. As evaluating inference results on a real dataset is controversial, the use of simulated data has been proposed. However, DBN approaches that use continuous variables, thus avoiding the information loss associated with discretization, have not yet been extensively assessed, and most of the proposed approaches have dealt with linear Gaussian models. Results We propose a generalization of dynamic Gaussian networks to accommodate nonlinear dependencies between variables. As a benchmark dataset to test the new approach, we used data from a mathematical model of cell cycle control in budding yeast that realistically reproduces the complexity of a cellular system. We evaluated the ability of the networks to describe the dynamics of cellular systems and their precision in reconstructing the true underlying causal relationships between variables. We also tested the robustness of the results by analyzing the effect of noise on the data, and the impact of a different sampling time. Conclusion The results confirmed that DBNs with Gaussian models can be effectively exploited for a first level analysis of data from complex cellular systems. The inferred models are parsimonious and have a satisfying goodness of fit. Furthermore, the networks not only offer a phenomenological description of the dynamics of cellular systems, but are also able to suggest hypotheses concerning the causal interactions between variables. The proposed nonlinear generalization of Gaussian models yielded models characterized by a slightly lower goodness of fit than the linear model, but a better ability to recover the true underlying connections between variables.",BMC bioinformatics,CS
0.809781767,31533622,Adverse drug reaction detection via a multihop self-attention mechanism,"Background The adverse reactions that are caused by drugs are potentially life-threatening problems. Comprehensive knowledge of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can reduce their detrimental impacts on patients. Detecting ADRs through clinical trials takes a large number of experiments and a long period of time. With the growing amount of unstructured textual data, such as biomedical literature and electronic records, detecting ADRs in the available unstructured data has important implications for ADR research. Most of the neural network-based methods typically focus on the simple semantic information of sentence sequences; however, the relationship of the two entities depends on more complex semantic information. Methods In this paper, we propose multihop self-attention mechanism (MSAM) model that aims to learn the multi-aspect semantic information for the ADR detection task. first, the contextual information of the sentence is captured by using the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model. Then, via applying the multiple steps of an attention mechanism, multiple semantic representations of a sentence are generated. Each attention step obtains a different attention distribution focusing on the different segments of the sentence. Meanwhile, our model locates and enhances various keywords from the multiple representations of a sentence. Results Our model was evaluated by using two ADR corpora. It is shown that the method has a stable generalization ability. Via extensive experiments, our model achieved F-measure of 0.853, 0.799 and 0.851 for ADR detection for TwiMed-PubMed, TwiMed-Twitter, and ADE, respectively. The experimental results showed that our model significantly outperforms other compared models for ADR detection. Conclusions In this paper, we propose a modification of multihop self-attention mechanism (MSAM) model for an ADR detection task.

0.361724901,25407532,Identification of genomic regions associated with inbreeding depression in Holstein and Jersey dairy cattle,"Background Inbreeding reduces the fitness of individuals by increasing the frequency of homozygous deleterious recessive alleles. Some insight into the genetic architecture of fitness, and other complex traits, can be gained by using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to identify regions of the genome which lead to reduction in performance when identical by descent (IBD). Here, we compared the effect of genome-wide and location-specific homozygosity on fertility and milk production traits in dairy cattle. Methods Genotype data from more than 43 000 SNPs were available for 8853 Holstein and 4138 Jersey dairy cows that were part of a much larger dataset that had pedigree records (338 696 Holstein and 64 049 Jersey animals). Measures of inbreeding were based on: (1) pedigree data; (2) genotypes to determine the realised proportion of the genome that is IBD; (3) the proportion of the total genome that is homozygous and (4) runs of homozygosity (ROH) which are stretches of the genome that are homozygous. Results A 1% increase in inbreeding based either on pedigree or genomic data was associated with a decrease in milk, fat and protein yields of around 0.4 to 0.6% of the phenotypic mean, and an increase in calving interval (i.e. a deterioration in fertility) of 0.02 to 0.05% of the phenotypic mean. A genome-wide association study using ROH of more than 50 SNPs revealed genomic regions that resulted in depression of up to 12.5 d and 260 L for calving interval and milk yield, respectively, when completely homozygous. Conclusions Genomic measures can be used instead of pedigree-based inbreeding to estimate inbreeding depression. Both the diagonal elements of the genomic relationship matrix and the proportion of homozygous SNPs can be used to measure inbreeding. Longer ROH (>3¬†Mb) were found to be associated with a reduction in milk yield and captured recent inbreeding independently and in addition to overall homozygosity. Inbreeding depression can be reduced by minimizing overall inbreeding but maybe also by avoiding the production of offspring that are homozygous for deleterious alleles at specific genomic regions that are associated with inbreeding depression.

0.447212918,28968736,NetProphet 2.0: mapping transcription factor networks by exploiting scalable data resources,"Abstract Motivation Cells process information, in part, through transcription factor (TF) networks, which control the rates at which individual genes produce their products. A TF network map is a graph that indicates which TFs bind and directly regulate each gene. Previous work has described network mapping algorithms that rely exclusively on gene expression data and ‚Äòintegrative‚Äô algorithms that exploit a wide range of data sources including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of many TFs, genome-wide chromatin marks, and binding specificities for many TFs determined in vitro . However, such resources are available only for a few major model systems and cannot be easily replicated for new organisms or cell types. Results We present NetProphet 2.0, a ‚Äòdata light‚Äô algorithm for TF network mapping, and show that it is more accurate at identifying direct targets of TFs than other, similarly data light algorithms. In particular, it improves on the accuracy of NetProphet 1.0, which used only gene expression data, by exploiting three principles. First, combining multiple approaches to network mapping from expression data can improve accuracy relative to the constituent approaches. Second, TFs with similar DNA binding domains bind similar sets of target genes. Third, even a noisy, preliminary network map can be used to infer DNA binding specificities from promoter sequences and these inferred specificities can be used to further improve the accuracy of the network map.

Increased frequencies of H5 HA specific antibody secreting and memory B cells could be observed within 7 days of re-vaccination. Furthermore, these responses were cross-reactive to both H5 HA variants, but not H3 or avian H6 HA strains. These observations suggest prior vaccination against H5 influenza HA induces cellular immune responses that cross-react among drifted variants, without precluding a response to new, or existing HA strains.

0.29009239,25485675,"Evaluation of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/carbon nanotube neural electrode coatings for stimulation in the dorsal root ganglion","  Objective  The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is an attractive target for implanting neural electrode arrays that restore sensory function or provide therapy via stimulation. However, penetrating microelectrodes designed for these applications are small and deliver low currents. For long-term performance of microstimulation devices, novel coating materials are needed in part to decrease impedance values at the electrode-tissue interface and to increase charge storage capacity.    Approach  Conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were coated on the electrode surface and doped with the anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone. Electrode characteristics and the tissue reaction around neural electrodes as the result of stimulation, coating and drug release were characterized. Hematoxylin and eosin staining along with antibodies recognizing Iba1 (microglia/macrophages), NF200 (neuronal axons), NeuN (neurons), vimentin (fibroblasts), caspase-3 (cell death) and L1 (neural cell adhesion molecule) were used. Quantitative image analyses were performed using MATLAB.    Main Results  Our results indicate that coated microelectrodes have lower in vitro and in vivo impedance values. Significantly less neuronal death/damage was observed with coated electrodes as compared to non-coated controls. The inflammatory response with the PEDOT/CNT-coated electrodes was also reduced.    Significance  This study is the first to report on the utility of these coatings in stimulation applications. Our results indicate PEDOT/CNT coatings may be valuable additions to implantable electrodes used as therapeutic modalities.  ",Journal of neural engineering,ENG

0.806436686,18273395,Attentional Bias for Threat: Evidence for Delayed Disengagement from Emotional Faces," The present paper reports three new experiments suggesting that the valence of a face cue can influence attentional effects in a cueing paradigm. Moreover, heightened trait anxiety resulted in increased attentional dwell-time on emotional facial stimuli, relative to neutral faces. Experiment 1 presented a cueing task, in which the cue was either an ‚Äúangry‚Äù, ‚Äúhappy‚Äù, or ‚Äúneutral‚Äù facial expression. Targets could appear either in the same location as the face (valid trials) or in a different location to the face (invalid trials). Participants did not show significant variations across the different cue types (angry, happy, neutral) in responding to a target on valid trials. However, the valence of the face did affect response times on invalid trials. Specifically, participants took longer to respond to a target when the face cue was ‚Äúangry‚Äù or ‚Äúhappy‚Äù relative to neutral. In Experiment 2, the cue-target stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was increased and an overall inhibition of return (IOR) effect was found (i.e., slower responses on valid trials). However, the ‚Äúangry‚Äù face cue eliminated the IOR effect for both high and low trait anxious groups. In Experiment 3, threat-related and jumbled facial stimuli reduced the magnitude of IOR for high, but not for low, trait-anxious participants.These results suggest that: (i) attentional bias in anxiety may reflect a difficulty in disengaging from threat-related and emotional stimuli, and (ii) threat-related and ambiguous cues can influence the magnitude of the IOR effect.

0.505808462,23715053,Prediction of molecular mimicry candidates in human pathogenic bacteria,"Molecular mimicry of host proteins is a common strategy adopted by bacterial pathogens to interfere with and exploit host processes. Despite the availability of pathogen genomes, few studies have attempted to predict virulence-associated mimicry relationships directly from genomic sequences. Here, we analyzed the proteomes of 62 pathogenic and 66 non-pathogenic bacterial species, and screened for the top pathogen-specific or pathogen-enriched sequence similarities to human proteins. The screen identified approximately 100 potential mimicry relationships including well-characterized examples among the top-scoring hits (e.g., RalF, internalin, yopH, and others), with about 1/3 of predicted relationships supported by existing literature. Examination of homology to virulence factors, statistically enriched functions, and comparison with literature indicated that the detected mimics target key host structures (e.g., extracellular matrix, ECM) and pathways (e.g., cell adhesion, lipid metabolism, and immune signaling). The top-scoring and most widespread mimicry pattern detected among pathogens consisted of elevated sequence similarities to ECM proteins including collagens and leucine-rich repeat proteins. Unexpectedly, analysis of the pathogen counterparts of these proteins revealed that they have evolved independently in different species of bacterial pathogens from separate repeat amplifications. Thus, our analysis provides evidence for two classes of mimics: complex proteins such as enzymes that have been acquired by eukaryote-to-pathogen horizontal transfer, and simpler repeat proteins that have independently evolved to mimic the host ECM. Ultimately, computational detection of pathogen-specific and pathogen-enriched similarities to host proteins provides insights into potentially novel mimicry-mediated virulence mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria.",Virulence,IMMUN
0.34230926,16835395,Gene deletion reveals roles for annexin A1 in the regulation of lipolysis and IL-6 release in epididymal adipose tissue," In this study, epididymal adipose tissue from male annexin 1 (ANXA1)-null and wild-type control mice were used to explore the potential role of ANXA1 in adipocyte biology. ANXA1 was detected by Western blot analysis in wild-type tissue and localized predominantly to the stromal-vascular compartment. Epididymal fat pad mass was reduced by ANXA1 gene deletion, but adipocyte size was unchanged, suggesting that ANXA1 is required for the maintenance of adipocyte and/or preadipocyte cell number. Epididymal tissue from wild-type mice responded in vitro to noradrenaline and isoprenaline with increased glycerol release, reduced IL-6 release, and increased cAMP accumulation. Qualitatively similar but significantly attenuated responses to the catecholamines were observed in tissue from ANXA1-null mice, an effect that was not associated with changes in Œ≤-adrenoceptor mRNA expression. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also stimulated lipolysis in vitro, but its effects were muted by ANXA1 gene deletion. By contrast, LPS failed to influence IL-6 release from wild-type tissue but stimulated the release of the cytokine from tissue from ANXA1-null mice. ANXA1 gene deletion did not affect glucocorticoid receptor expression or the ability of dexamethasone to suppress catecholamine-induced lipolysis. It did, however, augment IL-6 expression and modify the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on IL-6 release. Collectively, these studies suggest that ANXA1 supports aspects of adipose tissue mass and alters the sensitivity of epididymal adipose tissue to catecholamines, glucocorticoids, and LPS, thereby modulating lipolysis and IL-6 release.

No therapies are currently available to treat cystic diseases, making it imperative to dissect molecular mechanisms in search of therapeutic targets. Accumulating evidence suggests a pathogenic role for glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in multiple forms of PKD. It is not known, however, whether other structural glycosphingolipids (GSLs) or bioactive signaling sphingolipids (SLs) modulate cystogenesis. Therefore, we set out to address the role of a specific GSL (ganglioside GM3) and signaling SL (sphingosine-1-phosphate, S1P) in PKD progression, using the jck mouse model of nephronopthisis. To define the role of GM3 accumulation in cystogenesis, we crossed jck mice with mice carrying a targeted mutation in the GM3 synthase ( St3gal5 ) gene. GM3-deficient jck mice displayed milder PKD, revealing a pivotal role for ganglioside GM3. Mechanistic changes in regulation of the cell-cycle machinery and Akt-mTOR signaling were consistent with reduced cystogenesis. Dramatic overexpression of sphingosine kinase 1 ( Sphk1 ) mRNA in jck kidneys suggested a pathogenic role for S1P. Surprisingly, genetic loss of Sphk1 exacerbated cystogenesis and was associated with increased levels of GlcCer and GM3. On the other hand, increasing S1P accumulation through pharmacologic inhibition of S1P lyase had no effect on the progression of cystogenesis or kidney GSL levels. Together, these data suggest that genes involved in the SL metabolism may be modifiers of cystogenesis, and suggest GM3 synthase as a new anti-cystic therapeutic target.",Human molecular genetics,POPGENE

The model comprises a hierarchy of Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) nodes, which were recently shown to reproduce many properties of complex cells in the early visual system [ 1 ]. The system extracts a distributed grid-like representation of position and orientation, which is transcoded into a localized place-field, head-direction, or view representation, by sparse coding. The type of cells that develops depends solely on the relevant input statistics, i.e., the movement pattern of the simulated animal. The numerical simulations are complemented by a mathematical analysis that allows us to accurately predict the output of the top SFA layer. Author Summary Rats excel at navigating through complex environments. In order to find their way, they need to answer two basic questions. Where am I? In which direction am I heading? As the brain has no direct access to information about its position in space, it has to rely on sensory signals‚Äîfrom eyes and ears for example‚Äîto answer these questions. Information about its position and orientation is typically present in the information it gathers from its senses, but unfortunately it is encoded in a way that is not obvious to decode. Three major types of cells in the brain whose firing directly reflects spatial information are place, head-direction, and view cells. Place cells, for example, fire when the animal is at a particular location independent of the direction the animal is looking in. In this study, we present a self-organizational model that develops these three representation types by learning on naturalistic videos mimicking the visual input of a rat.

The mechanical properties of 3.2‚Äâmm and 1.6‚Äâmm thick commercial medical splint materials (Aquaplast, AP) and experimental GF prepared from 1.6‚Äâmm thick AP and fiberglass cloth were determined by a three-point bending test. Shock absorption tests were conducted on APs with two different thicknesses and two types of experimental materials, both with a bottom material of 1.6‚Äâmm thick AP and a buffering space of 30‚Äâmm in diameter (APS) and with either (i) 1.6‚Äâmm thick AP (AP-APS) or (ii) ‚Äâ1.6‚Äâmm thick GF (GF-APS) covering the APS. The GF exhibited significantly higher flexural strength (64.4‚ÄâMPa) and flexural modulus (7.53‚ÄâGPa) than the commercial specimens. The maximum load of GF-APS was 75% that of 3.2‚Äâmm AP, which is widely used clinically. The maximum stress of the GF-APS only could not be determined as its maximum stress is below the limits of the analysis materials used (<0.5‚ÄâMPa). Incorporating a GF and buffering space would enhance the shock absorption ability; thus, the shock absorption ability increased while the total thickness and weight decreased.",BioMed research international,ENG

However, the shapes of MEFV curves have received less attention. We questioned if the MEFV curve shape was associated with (i) expiratory flow limitation (EFL) in health and (ii) changes in bronchial caliber in asthmatics. Using the slope-ratio (SR) index, we quantified MEFV curve shape in 84 healthy subjects and 8 matched asthmatics. Healthy subjects performed a maximal exercise test to assess EFL. Those with EFL during had a greater SR (1.15 ¬± 0.20 vs. 0.85 ¬± 0.20, p < 0.05) yet, there was no association between maximal oxygen consumption and SR (r = 0.14, p > 0.05). Asthmatics average SR was greater than the healthy subjects (1.35 ¬± 0.03 vs. 0.90 ¬± 0.11, p < 0.05), but there were no differences when bronchial caliber was manipulated. In conclusion, a greater SR is related to EFL and this metric could aid in discriminating between groups known to differ in the absolute size of MEFV curves.

A randomised controlled trial was conducted in 46 adult women in a day-care or short-stay hospital setting after major breast cancer surgery. Pain-intensity was measured using an 11-point visual analogue scale (VAS) until postoperative day 2. GA-sPVB was stopped due to slow inclusion. No significant difference in VAS score was noted between GA-LWI (VAS median 0.5 (interquartile range 0.18‚Äì2.00)) and GA-cPVB, (VAS 0.3 (0.00‚Äì1.55, p =‚Äâ0.195)) 24¬†hours after surgery or at any point postoperatively until postoperative day 2. We conclude that both GA-LWI and GA-cPVB anaesthetic techniques are equally effective in treatment of acute postoperative pain after major oncological breast surgery.

0.377141302,23590724,"Bisphenol A-associated epigenomic changes in prepubescent girls: a cross-sectional study in Gharbiah, Egypt","Background There is now compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link adult disease susceptibility to environmental exposures during specific life stages, including pre-pubertal development. Animal studies indicate that bisphenol A (BPA), the monomer used in epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics, may impact health through epigenetic mechanisms, and epidemiological data associate BPA levels with metabolic disorders, behavior changes, and reproductive effects. Thus, we conducted an environmental epidemiology study of BPA exposure and CpG methylation in pre-adolescent girls from Gharbiah, Egypt hypothesizing that methylation profiles exhibit exposure-dependent trends. Methods Urinary concentrations of total (free plus conjugated) species of BPA in spot samples were quantified for 60 girls aged 10 to 13. Genome-wide CpG methylation was concurrently measured in bisulfite-converted saliva DNA using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ46). CpG sites from four candidate genes were validated via quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing. Results CpG methylation varied widely among girls, and higher urinary BPA concentrations were generally associated with less genomic methylation. Based on pathway analyses, genes exhibiting reduced methylation with increasing urinary BPA were involved in immune function, transport activity, metabolism, and caspase activity. In particular, hypomethylation of CpG targets on chromosome X was associated with higher urinary BPA. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, we identified a number of candidate genes in our sample that previously have been associated with BPA-related expression change. Conclusions These data indicate that BPA may affect human health through specific epigenomic modification of genes in relevant pathways. Thus, epigenetic epidemiology holds promise for the identification of biomarkers from previous exposures and the development of epigenetic-based diagnostic strategies.",Environmental health : a global access science source,ENVIRON
0.27130593,16526504,EVALUATING THE COSTS OF MOSQUITO RESISTANCE TO MALARIA PARASITES," Costly resistance mechanisms have been cited as an explanation for the widespread occurrence of parasitic infections, yet few studies have examined these costs in detail. A malaria-mosquito model has been used to test this concept by making a comparison of the fitness of highly susceptible lines of mosquitoes with lines that are resistant to infection. Malaria infection is known to cause a decrease in fecundity and fertility of mosquitoes; resistant mosquitoes were thus predicted to be fitter than susceptible ones. Anopheles gambiae were selected for refractoriness/resistance or for increased susceptibility to infection by Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis . Additional lines that acted as controls for inbreeding depression were raised in parallel but not exposed to selection pressure. Selections were made in triplicate so that founder effects could be detected. Resistance mechanisms that were selected included melanotic encapsulation of parasites within 24 h postinfection and the complete disappearance of parasites from the gut. Costs of immune surveillance were assessed after an uninfected feed, and costs of immune deployment were assessed after exposure to infection and to infection and additional stresses. Mosquito survivorship was unaffected by either resistance to infection or by an increased burden of infection when compared with low levels of infection. In most cases reproductive fitness was equally affected by refractoriness or by infection. Resistant mosquitoes did not gain a fitness advantage by eliminating the parasites. Costs were consistently associated with larval production and egg hatch rate but rarely attributed to changes in blood feeding and never to changes in mosquito size. No advantages appeared to be gained by the offspring of resistant mosquitoes. Furthermore, we were unable to select for refractoriness in groups of mosquitoes in which 100% or 50% of the population were exposed to infection every generation for 22 generations. Under these selection pressures, no population had become completely refractory and only one became more resistant. Variations in fitness relative to control lines in different groups were attributed to founder effects. Our conclusion from these findings is that refractoriness to malaria is as costly as tolerance of infection. ",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,ECO
0.892182319,27653966,Actigraphy features for predicting mobility disability in older adults," Actigraphy has attracted much attention for assessing physical activity in the past decade. Many algorithms have been developed to automate the analysis process, but none has targeted a general model to discover related features for detecting or predicting mobility function, or more specifically, mobility impairment and major mobility disability (MMD). Men (N=357) and women (N=778) aged 70‚Äì89 years wore a tri-axial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X) on the right hip during free-living conditions for 8.4¬±3.0 days. One-second epoch data were summarized into 67 features. Several machine learning techniques were used to select features from the free-living condition to predict mobility impairment, defined as 400 m walking speed <0.80 m/sec. Selected features were also included in a model to predict the first occurrence of MMD‚Äî defined as the loss in the ability to walk 400 meters. Each method yielded a similar estimate of 400 meter walking speed with a root mean square error of ~0.07 m/sec and an R-squared values ranging from 0.37‚Äì0.41. Sensitivity and specificity of identifying slow walkers was approximately 70% and 80% for all methods, respectively. The top five features, which were related to movement pace and amount (activity counts and steps), length in activity engagement (bout length), accumulation patterns of activity, and movement variability significantly improved the prediction of MMD beyond that found with common covariates (age, diseases, anthropometry etc.). This study identified a subset of actigraphy features collected in free-living conditions that are moderately accurate in identifying persons with clinically-assessed mobility impaired and significantly improve the prediction of MMD. These findings suggest that the combination of features as opposed to a specific feature is important to consider when choosing features and/or combinations of features for prediction of mobility phenotypes in older adults.

Without using excitation and induction coils, the sensor mainly consists of a static magnetization unit made of permanent magnets and a magnetic field measurement unit containing Hall element arrays. Firstly, the principle is illustrated in detail. Under the excitation of the magnetization unit, a spatially varying magnetized region in the steel wire is utilized as the measurement region. Radial and axial magnetic flux densities at different lift-offs in this region are measured by the measurement unit to calculate the differential permeability curve and magnetization curve. Feature parameters extracted from the curves are used to evaluate the axial stress. Secondly, the special stress sensor for Œ¶5 and Œ¶7 steel wires is developed accordingly. At last, the performance of the sensor is tested experimentally. Experimental results show that the sensor can measure the magnetization curve accurately with the error in the range of ¬±6%. Furthermore, the obtained differential permeability at working points 1200 A/m and 10000 A/m change almost linearly with the stress in steel wires, the goodness of linear fits are all higher than 0.987. Thus, the proposed steel wire stress measuring sensor is feasible.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",ENG
0.625899581,25818173,Rate of evolutionary change in cranial morphology of the marsupial genus  Monodelphis  is constrained by the availability of additive genetic variation," We tested the hypothesis that the rate of marsupial cranial evolution is dependent on the distribution of genetic variation in multivariate space. To do so, we carried out a genetic analysis of cranial morphological variation in laboratory strains of Monodelphis domestica and used estimates of genetic covariation to analyze the morphological diversification of the Monodelphis brevicaudata species group. We found that within-species genetic variation is concentrated in only a few axes of the morphospace and that this strong genetic covariation influenced the rate of morphological diversification of the brevicaudata group, with between-species divergence occurring fastest when occurring along the genetic line of least resistance. Accounting for the geometric distribution of genetic variation also increased our ability to detect the selective regimen underlying species diversification, with several instances of selection only being detected when genetic covariances were taken into account. Therefore, this work directly links patterns of genetic covariation among traits to macroevolutionary patterns of morphological divergence. Our findings also suggest that the limited distribution of Monodelphis species in morphospace is the result of a complex interplay between the limited dimensionality of available genetic variation and strong stabilizing selection along two major axes of genetic variation.

Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks show that this measure returns non-zero values only when the graphs are non-isomorphic. Most importantly, the measure proposed here can identify and quantify structural topological differences that have a practical impact on the information flow through the network, such as the presence or absence of critical links that connect or disconnect connected components.

0.525462775,25620874,Non-sulfate sulfur in fine aerosols across the United States: Insight for organosulfate prevalence," We investigated the discrepancies in long-term sulfur measurements from 2000 to 2012 by two separate speciation methods, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and ion chromatography (IC) across the United States (334 sites). Overall, there was a good correlation between sulfur measurements by XRF spectroscopy and IC (R ‚â• 0.90 for most of the sites). However, the inorganic sulfate measured by ion chromatography was not sufficient to account for all the sulfur measured by XRF spectroscopy at many of the sites. Discrepancies were observed with the high ratios of sulfur measured by XRF spectroscopy to that by IC. Such high ratios also exhibited seasonal variation, and differed across land use types; significant differences occurred at locations classified as forest, agriculture, and mobile, but not in locations classified as commercial, desert, industrial, and residential. On average, the excess, or non-sulfate, sulfur (unmeasured organic sulfur or other inorganic species of sulfur) was variable and observed as high as ~13% of organic carbon and ~2% of PM 2.5 . The contribution of such assumed organosulfur was larger in the eastern region than other geographical locations in the United States. Besides the temporal and spatial trends, the additional sulfur was found to be related to other factors such as aerosol acidity and emission sources. The results suggest that these unmeasured sulfur species could have significant contribution to aerosol burden, and the understanding of these could help to control PM 2.5 levels and to assess other effects of sulfur aerosols.

It can be difficult to triage patients with chest pain while using cocaine. Objective To assess the reliability of the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) done in the emergency department in current cocaine users suspected of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in predicting a true event. Methods A total of 218 charts of current cocaine users who presented with chest pain judged as possibly cardiac in nature with an initial ECG from September 2003 to August 2007 were reviewed. Initial ECG was classified into: (1) Category A (inverted T waves in two or more contiguous leads and/or characteristic ST segment elevation or depression indicative of an ischemic event possibly acute); (2) Category B (other ischemic changes but without any ST or T abnormalities such as Q wave, or bundle branch block); or (3) Category C (normal tracing, non-specific ST segment or T wave alterations). Results Eighteen of 218 (8.3%) were confirmed to have ACS. Ten of 18 confirmed ACS patients were among the 70 cases with ECG classified as Category A. One hundred and one of 218 were Category C ECGs: five of these had ACS (three of the five had significant cardiac history) and 96 did not, consistent with 95% negative predictive value.

We collected seeds from established plants of the perennial grass Elymus elymoides ssp. californicus (squirreltail) at two restoration sites and compared the distribution of phenotypic traits of surviving plants with the original pool of restoration seeds. Seeds were planted in common gardens for two generations. Plants grown from seeds that established in the field were a nonrandom subset of the original seeds, with directional selection consistently favoring a correlated suite of traits in both field sites: small plant and seed size, and earlier flowering phenology. These results demonstrate that natural selection can affect restoration establishment in strong and predictable ways and that adaptive traits in these sites were opposite of the current criteria used for selection of restoration material in this system.",Evolutionary applications,ECO

Pinus chiapensis is an endangered pioneer key species for tropical montane cloud forest regeneration in Mesoamerica. Human activities have severely reduced some P. chiapensis populations, which exhibited a small or null colonization potential suggesting the involvement of genetic factors associated with small populations. We explored the relationships between (i) population genetic diversity (allozymes) and population size, including sampling size effects, (ii) fitness estimates associated with colonization potential (seed viability and seedling performance) in a common environment and population size, and (iii) fitness estimates and observed heterozygosity in populations with sizes spanning five orders of magnitude. All the estimates of genetic diversity and fitness increased significantly with population size. Low fitness was detected in progenies of small populations of disturbed and undisturbed habitats. Progenies with the lowest observed heterozygosity displayed the lowest fitness estimates, which, in turn, increased with heterozygosity, but seed viability peaked at intermediate heterozygosity values suggesting inbreeding and outbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression appears to be the most immediate genetic factor in population decline.

The present study examined eye movement characteristics of goal-directed internally focused cognition. Deliberate internally focused cognition was induced by an idea generation task. A letter-by-letter reading task served as external task. Idea generation (vs. reading) was associated with more and longer blinks and fewer microsaccades indicating an attenuation of visual input. Idea generation was further associated with more and shorter fixations, more saccades and saccades with higher amplitudes as well as heightened stimulus-independent variation of eye vergence. The latter results suggest a coupling of eye behavior to internally generated information and associated cognitive processes, i.e. searching for ideas. Our results support eye behavior patterns as indicators of goal-directed internally focused cognition through mechanisms of attenuation of visual input and coupling of eye behavior to internally generated information.

0.745588249,22472487,Computational identification of adaptive mutants using the VERT system,"Background Evolutionary dynamics of microbial organisms can now be visualized using the Visualizing Evolution in Real Time (VERT) system, in which several isogenic strains expressing different fluorescent proteins compete during adaptive evolution and are tracked using fluorescent cell sorting to construct a population history over time. Mutations conferring enhanced growth rates can be detected by observing changes in the fluorescent population proportions. Results Using data obtained from several VERT experiments, we construct a hidden Markov-derived model to detect these adaptive events in VERT experiments without external intervention beyond initial training. Analysis of annotated data revealed that the model achieves consensus with human annotation for 85-93% of the data points when detecting adaptive events. A method to determine the optimal time point to isolate adaptive mutants is also introduced. Conclusions The developed model offers a new way to monitor adaptive evolution experiments without the need for external intervention, thereby simplifying adaptive evolution efforts relying on population tracking. Future efforts to construct a fully automated system to isolate adaptive mutants may find the algorithm a useful tool.",Journal of biological engineering,CS

Yet, the efficacy of the combination of weight loss and metformin in the treatment of NAFLD is unclear. We assessed the effects of metformin, caloric restriction, and their combination on NAFLD in diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. Male OLETF rats (age 20 weeks; n = 6‚Äì8 per group) were fed ad libitum (AL), given metformin (300 mg¬∑kg ‚àí1 ¬∑day ‚àí1 ; Met), calorically restricted (70% of AL; CR), or calorically restricted and given metformin (CR+Met) for 12 weeks. Met lowered adiposity compared with AL but not to the same magnitude as CR or CR+Met ( p < 0.05). Although only CR improved fasting insulin and glucose, the combination of CR+Met was needed to improve post-challenge glucose tolerance. All treatments lowered hepatic triglycerides, but further improvements were observed in the CR groups ( p < 0.05, Met vs. CR or CR+Met) and a further reduction in serum alanine aminotransferases was observed in CR+Met rats. CR lowered markers of hepatic de novo lipogenesis (fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1)) and increased hepatic mitochondrial activity (palmitate oxidation and Œ≤-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (Œ≤-HAD) activity). Changes were enhanced in the CR+Met group for ACC, SCD-1, Œ≤-HAD, and the mitophagy marker BNIP3. Met decreased total hepatic mTOR content and inhibited mTOR complex 1, which may have contributed to Met-induced reductions in de novo lipogenesis. These findings in the OLETF rat suggest that the combination of caloric restriction and metformin may provide a more optimal approach than either treatment alone in the management of type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.

0.217027197,30781422,"Soil Pollution Characteristics and Microbial Responses in a Vertical Profile with Long-Term Tannery Sludge Contamination in Hebei, China","An investigation was made into the effects of tannery sludge on soil chemical properties and microbial communities in a typical soil profile with long-term tannery sludge contamination, North China. The results showed that trivalent chromium (Cr(III)), ammonium, organic nitrogen, salinity and sulfide were the predominant contaminants in tannery sludge. Although the tannery sludge contained high chromium (Cr, 3,0970 mg/kg), the proportion of mobile Cr forms (exchangeable plus carbonate-bound fraction) only accounted for 1.32%. The X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results further demonstrated that the Cr existed in a stable state of oxides and iron oxides. The alkaline loam soil had a significant retardation effect on the migration of salinity, ammonium, Cr(III) and sulfide, and the accumulation of these contaminants occurred in soils (0‚Äì40 cm). A good correlation (R 2 = 0.959) was observed between total organic carbon (TOC) and Cr(III) in the soil profile, indicating that the dissolved organic matter from sludge leachate promoted the vertical mobility of Cr(III) via forming Cr(III)-organic complexes. The halotolerant bacteria ( Halomonas and Tepidimicrobium ) and organic degrading bacteria ( Flavobacteriaceae , Tepidimicrobium and Balneola ) became the dominant microflora in the soil profile.

0.059015189,25620807,Optimal Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Discriminant Analysis," We consider the high-dimensional discriminant analysis problem. For this problem, different methods have been proposed and justified by establishing exact convergence rates for the classification risk, as well as the ‚Ñì 2 convergence results to the discriminative rule. However, sharp theoretical analysis for the variable selection performance of these procedures have not been established, even though model interpretation is of fundamental importance in scientific data analysis. This paper bridges the gap by providing sharp sufficient conditions for consistent variable selection using the sparse discriminant analysis ( Mai et al., 2012 ). Through careful analysis, we establish rates of convergence that are significantly faster than the best known results and admit an optimal scaling of the sample size n , dimensionality p , and sparsity level s in the high-dimensional setting. Sufficient conditions are complemented by the necessary information theoretic limits on the variable selection problem in the context of high-dimensional discriminant analysis. Exploiting a numerical equivalence result, our method also establish the optimal results for the ROAD estimator ( Fan et al., 2012 ) and the sparse optimal scaling estimator ( Clemmensen et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, we analyze an exhaustive search procedure, whose performance serves as a benchmark, and show that it is variable selection consistent under weaker conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrating the sharpness of the bounds are also provided. ",IEEE transactions on information theory,CS
0.384159491,15170847,High-Resolution Fast Spin Echo Imaging of the Human Brain at 4.7 T: Implementation and Sequence Characteristics," In this work, a number of important issues associated with fast spin echo (FSE) imaging of the human brain at 4.7 T are addressed. It is shown that FSE enables the acquisition of images with high resolution and good tissue contrast throughout the brain at high field strength. By employing an echo spacing (ES) of 22 ms, one can use large flip angle refocusing pulses (162¬∞) and a low acquisition bandwidth (50 kHz) to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A new method of phase encode (PE) ordering (called ‚Äúfeathering‚Äù) designed to reduce image artifacts is described, and the contributions of RF ( B 1 ) inhomogeneity, different echo coherence pathways, and magnetization transfer (MT) to FSE signal intensity and contrast are investigated. B 1 inhomogeneity is measured and its effect is shown to be relatively minor for high-field FSE, due to the self-compensating characteristics of the sequence. Thirty-four slice data sets (slice thickness = 2 mm; in-plane resolution = 0.469 mm; acquisition time = 11 min 20 s) from normal volunteers are presented, which allow visualization of brain anatomy in fine detail. This study demonstrates that high-field FSE produces images of the human brain with high spatial resolution, SNR, and tissue contrast, within currently prescribed power deposition guidelines.

Earthquakes have not been considered as a stationary excitation source because they occur intermittently. Here we report that acoustic-coupled Rayleigh waves (at 0.7‚Äì2.0‚ÄâHz) travelling in the ocean and marine sediments, retrieved by correlating ambient noise on a hydrophone array deployed through a shallow to deep seafloor (100‚Äì4,800‚Äâm) across the Nankai Trough, Japan, are incessantly excited by nearby small earthquakes. The observed cross-correlation functions and 2D numerical simulations for wave propagation through a laterally heterogeneous ocean‚Äìcrust system show that, in a subduction zone, energetic wave sources are located primarily under the seafloor in directions consistent with nearby seismicity, and secondarily in the ocean. Short-period background noise in the ocean‚Äìcrust system in the Nankai subduction zone is mainly attributed to ocean-acoustic Rayleigh waves of earthquake origin.  Excitations of seismic background noise are mostly related to fluid disturbances, and earthquakes have not been considered as a source due to their intermittent nature. Here, the authors use a seabed hydrophone array and show that background noise offshore Japan is mainly due to small earthquakes.",Nature communications,ENVIRON
0.624105611,19809598,Molecular packing and magnetic properties of lithium naphthalocyanine crystals: hollow channels enabling permeability and paramagnetic sensitivity to molecular oxygen," The synthesis, structural framework, magnetic and oxygen-sensing properties of a lithium naphthalocyanine (LiNc) radical probe are presented. LiNc was synthesized in the form of a microcrystalline powder using a chemical method and characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, and mass spectrometry. X-Ray powder diffraction studies revealed a structural framework that possesses long, hollow channels running parallel to the packing direction. The channels measured approximately 5.0 √ó 5.4 √Ö 2 in the two-dimensional plane perpendicular to the length of the channel, enabling diffusion of oxygen molecules (2.9 √ó 3.9 √Ö 2 ) through the channel. The powdered LiNc exhibited a single, sharp EPR line under anoxic conditions, with a peak-to-peak linewidth of 630 mG at room temperature. The linewidth was sensitive to surrounding molecular oxygen, showing a linear increase in p O 2 with an oxygen sensitivity of 31.2 mG per mmHg. The LiNc microcrystals can be further prepared as nano-sized crystals without the loss of its high oxygen-sensing properties. The thermal variation of the magnetic properties of LiNc, such as the EPR linewidth, EPR intensity and magnetic susceptibility revealed the existence of two different temperature regimes of magnetic coupling and hence differing columnar packing, both being one-dimensional antiferromagnetic chains but with differing magnitudes of exchange coupling constants. At a temperature of ‚àº50 K, LiNc crystals undergo a reversible phase transition. The high degree of oxygen-sensitivity of micro- and nano-sized crystals of LiNc, combined with excellent stability, should enable precise and accurate measurements of oxygen concentration in biological systems using EPR spectroscopy.

0.243843188,30716700,Viral Infection or IFN-Œ± Alters Mitotic Spindle Orientation by Modulating Pericentrin Levels,"Summary Congenital microcephaly occurs in utero during Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. The single-gene disorder, Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPDII), also leads to microcephaly and is concomitant with a decrease in the centrosomal protein, pericentrin (PCNT). This protein is a known contributor of mitotic spindle misorientation and ultimately, microcephaly. Similar to MOPDII, either viral infection or interferon (IFN)-Œ± exposure reduced PCNT levels at the mitotic spindle poles. We unexpectedly found that infection of cells with any one of a diverse set of viruses, such as ZIKV, dengue virus, cytomegalovirus, influenza A virus, or hepatitis B virus, or treatment of cells with the anti-viral cytokine, IFN-Œ±, produced mitotic spindle misorientation. These findings demonstrate a related mechanism for the development of microcephaly in viral infection, the host's antiviral IFN response, and primordial dwarfism.

0.416280933,29152186,Cumulative effects of climate and landscape change drive spatial distribution of Rocky Mountain wolverine ( Gulo gulo  L.),"Abstract Contemporary landscapes are subject to a multitude of human‚Äêderived stressors. Effects of such stressors are increasingly realized by population declines and large‚Äêscale extirpation of taxa worldwide. Most notably, cumulative effects of climate and landscape change can limit species‚Äô local adaptation and dispersal capabilities, thereby reducing realized niche space and range extent. Resolving the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on species persistence is a pressing challenge in ecology, especially for declining species. For example, wolverines ( Gulo gulo L.) persist on only 40% of their historic North American range. While climate change has been shown to be a mechanism of range retractions, anthropogenic landscape disturbance has been recently implicated. We hypothesized these two interact to effect declines. We surveyed wolverine occurrence using camera trapping and genetic tagging at 104 sites at the wolverine range edge, spanning a 15,000¬†km 2 gradient of climate, topographic, anthropogenic, and biotic variables. We used occupancy and generalized linear models to disentangle the factors explaining wolverine distribution. Persistent spring snow pack‚Äîexpected to decrease with climate change‚Äîwas a significant predictor, but so was anthropogenic landscape change. Canid mesocarnivores, which we hypothesize are competitors supported by anthropogenic landscape change, had comparatively weaker effect. Wolverine population declines and range shifts likely result from climate change and landscape change operating in tandem. We contend that similar results are likely for many species and that research that simultaneously examines climate change, landscape change, and the biotic landscape is warranted. Ecology research and species conservation plans that address these interactions are more likely to meet their objectives.",Ecology and evolution,ECO

In this context, mobile technologies have been used with promising results, but often have restricted functionality, or are either difficult to use or do not provide the necessary support to the caregiver - which leads to declining usage over time. Therefore, we developed the Mobile System for Elderly Monitoring, SMAI. The purpose of SMAI is to monitor patients with functional loss and to improve the support to caregivers‚Äô communication with the health team professionals, informing them the data related to the patients‚Äô daily lives, while providing the health team better tools. Method SMAI is composed of mobile applications developed for the caregivers and health team, and a web portal that supports management activities. Caregivers use an Android application to send information and receive care advice and feedback from the health team. The system was constructed using a refinement stage approach. Each stage involved caregivers and the health team in prototype release-test-assessment-refinement cycles. SMAI was evaluated during 18 months. We studied which features were being used the most, and their use pattern throughout the week. We also studied the users‚Äô qualitative perceptions. Finally, the caregiver application was also evaluated for usability. Results SMAI functionalities showed to be very useful or useful to caregivers and health professionals. The Focus Group interviews reveled that among caregivers the use of the application gave them the sensation of being connected to the health team. The usability evaluation identified that the interface design and associated tasks were easy to use and the System Usability Scale, SUS, presented very good results. Conclusions In general, the use of SMAI represented a positive change for the family caregivers and for the NAI health team.

A survey of the literature reveals that two reversed phase HPLC methods were e reported for the simultaneous determination of LEV and AMB in pharmaceutical preparations. However the reported methods suffers from the low sensitivity, no application of the method in the combined tablets and no application to biological fluids. Also the toxic effects of the used solvents which are harmful to human beings. For this reason, our target was to develop a simple sensitive, less hazardous micellar HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of LEV and AMB in their combined dosage forms and plasma. Results The method showed good linearity over the ranges of 1‚Äì44 Œºg/mL and 1‚Äì20 Œºg/mL with limits of detection 0.26 and 0.07 Œºg/mL and limits of quantification 0.80 and 0.20 Œºg/mL for LEV and AMB, respectively.

0.267588363,18513413,Safety of carboxymethylcellulose/polyethylene oxide for the prevention of adhesions in lumbar disc herniation ‚Äì consecutive case series review,"Background Epidural fibrosis is regarded as a cause of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) when excessive adhesional/fibrotic scar tissue causes compression, pain or discomfort by tethering of nerve tissue to the surrounding muscle or bone. Fibrosis inhibitors could therefore increase the success rate of spinal surgery and decrease the need for reoperations. In recent years, bio-resorbable gels or films for the prevention of peridural fibrosis and post-operative adhesions have been developed that look clinically promising. This included a 100% synthetic, sterile, absorbable gel combinations of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) used to coat the dura to reduce scarring after discectomy which became available in Europe in 2002. However, given the burden of the problem and unfavorable experience with other types of adhesion-reduction agents, our unit decided to evaluate the safety of CMC/PEO in a large population of patients undergoing spinal microdiscectomy for herniation. Methods To determine the safety and assess efficacy of carboxymethylcellulose/polyethylene oxide (CMC/PEO) gel as an anti-adhesion gel, a consecutive series of 396 patients undergoing lumbar discectomy performed by one surgeon had CMC/PEO gel administered at the end of surgery. The patients were followed up in accordance with standard clinical practice and records reviewed for side effects, such as skin reactions, general reactions or local fluid collections. Reoperations for recurrent herniation included an evaluation of fibrosis reduction. Results No product related complications were observed. Five patients needed reoperations for recurrent herniation. Significant but subjective reduction in fibrosis was observed in these patients. Conclusion The findings provide confidence that CMC/PEO gel is well tolerated as an agent to achieve reduction of fibrosis in lumbar disc surgery.

0.279259685,30416244,Signal and noise characteristics of a CdTe-based photon counting detector: Cascaded systems analysis and experimental studies," Recent advances in single photon counting detectors (PCDs) are opening up new opportunities in medical imaging. However, the performance of PCDs is not flawless. Problems such as charge sharing may deteriorate the performance of PCD. This work studied the dependence of the signal and noise properties of a cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based PCD on the charge sharing effect and the anti-charge sharing (ACS) capability offered by the PCD. Through both serial and parallel cascaded systems analysis, a theoretical model was developed to trace the origin of charge sharing in CdTe-based PCD, which is primarily related to remote k-fluorescence re-absorption and spatial spreading of charge cloud. The ACS process was modeled as a sub-imaging state prior to the energy thresholding stage, and its impact on the noise power spectrum (NPS) of PCD can be qualitatively determined by the theoretical model. To validate the theoretical model, experimental studies with a CdTe-based PCD system (XC-FLITE X1, XCounter AB) was performed. Two x-ray radiation conditions, including an RQA-5 beam and a 40 kVp beam, were used for the NPS measurements. Both theoretical predictions and experimental results showed that ACS makes the NPS of the CdTe-based PCD flatter, which corresponds to reduced noise correlation length. The flatness of the NPS is further boosted by increasing the energy threshold or reducing the x-ray energy, both of which reduce the likelihood of registering multiple counts from the same incidenting x-ray photon.

The nanopatterns promote microscale mass transfer, increase surface area and probe density to enhance the efficiency and speed of exosome binding, and permit drainage of the boundary fluid to reduce near-surface hydrodynamic resistance, thus promoting particle‚Äìsurface interactions for exosome binding. We used the device for the detection, in 2-ŒºL plasma samples from 20 ovarian cancer patients and from 10 age-matched controls, of exosome subpopulations expressing CD24, EpCAM, and FRalpha proteins, and suggest exosomal FRalpha as a potential biomarker for the early detection and progression monitoring of ovarian cancer.

0.030603992,20833396,Muscle Contributions to Whole-Body Sagittal Plane Angular Momentum during Walking," Walking is a complex dynamic task that requires the regulation of whole-body angular momentum to maintain dynamic balance while performing walking subtasks such as propelling the body forward and accelerating the leg into swing. In human walking, the primary mechanism to regulate angular momentum is muscle force generation. Muscles accelerate body segments and generate ground reaction forces that alter angular momentum about the body‚Äôs center-of-mass to restore and maintain dynamic stability. In addition, gravity contributes to whole-body angular momentum through its contribution to the ground reaction forces. The purpose of this study was to generate a muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulation of normal walking to quantify how individual muscles and gravity contribute to whole-body angular momentum in the sagittal plane. In early stance, the uniarticular hip and knee extensors (GMAX, VAS), biarticular hamstrings (HAM) and ankle dorsiflexors (TA) generated backward angular momentum while the ankle plantar flexors (SOL, GAS) generated forward momentum. In late stance, SOL and GAS where the primary contributors and generated angular momentum in opposite directions. SOL generated primarily forward angular momentum while GAS generated backward angular momentum. The difference between muscles was due to their relative contributions to the horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces. Gravity contributed to the body‚Äôs angular momentum in early stance and to a lesser extent in late stance, which was counteracted primarily by the plantar flexors. These results may provide insight into balance and movement disorders and provide a basis for developing locomotor therapies that target specific muscle groups. ",Journal of biomechanics,PHYSIO
0.117415325,28461348,Outpatient Office Wait Times and Quality of Care for Medicaid Patients," Time spent in the doctor‚Äôs waiting room captures an important aspect of the healthcare experience. We analyzed data on 21 million outpatient visits obtained from electronic health record systems, allowing us to measure time spent in the waiting room beyond the scheduled appointment time. Median wait time was just over 4 minutes. Almost one-fifth of visits had waits longer than 20 minutes, and 10% were over 30 minutes. Waits were shorter for early morning appointments, younger patients, and at larger practices. Median wait time was 4.1 minutes for privately-insured and 4.6 minutes for Medicaid patients; adjusting for patient and appointment characteristics, Medicaid patients were 20% more likely than the privately-insured to wait longer than 20 minutes (P<0.001), with most of this disparity explained by differences in practices and providers they saw. Wait time for Medicaid patients relative to the privately-insured was longer in states with relatively lower Medicaid reimbursement rates. ",Health affairs (Project Hope),EPIDEM
0.282797362,27442268,Primary care emergency team training in situ means learning in real context,"Objective The purpose of our study was to explore the local learning processes and to improve in situ team training in the primary care emergency teams with a focus on interaction. Design, setting and subjects As participating observers, we investigated locally organised trainings of teams constituted ad hoc, involving nurses, paramedics and general practitioners, in rural Norway. Subsequently, we facilitated focus discussions with local participants. We investigated what kinds of issues the participants chose to elaborate in these learning situations, why they did so, and whether and how local conditions improved during the course of three and a half years. In addition, we applied learning theories to explore and challenge our own and the local participants‚Äô understanding of team training. Results In situ team training was experienced as challenging, engaging, and enabling. In the training sessions and later focus groups, the participants discussed a wide range of topics constitutive for learning in a sociocultural perspective, and topics constitutive for patient safety culture. The participants expanded the types of training sites, themes and the structures for participation, improved their understanding of communication and developed local procedures. The flexible structure of the model mirrors the complexity of medicine and provides space for the participants‚Äô own sense of responsibility. Conclusion Challenging, monthly in situ team trainings organised by local health personnel facilitate many types of learning. The flexible training model provides space for the participants‚Äô own sense of responsibility and priorities. Outcomes involve social and structural improvements, including a sustainable culture of patient safety. Key Points  Challenging, monthly in situ team trainings, organised by local health personnel, facilitate many types of learning. The flexible structure of the training model mirrors the complexity of medicine and the realism of the simulation sessions. Providing room for the participants‚Äô own priorities and sense of responsibility allows for improvement on several levels. The participants demonstrated a consistent, long-term motivation to strengthen safety, both for their patients and for themselves. ",Scandinavian journal of primary health care,CLINIC
0.588791681,28973161,"Identification of a novel synaptic protein, TMTC3, involved in periventricular nodular heterotopia with intellectual disability and epilepsy","Abstract Defects in neuronal migration cause brain malformations, which are associated with intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy. Using exome sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous variants (p.Arg71His and p. Leu729ThrfsTer6) in TMTC3 , encoding transmembrane and tetratricopeptide repeat containing 3, in four siblings with nocturnal seizures and ID. Three of the four siblings have periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH), a common brain malformation caused by failure of neurons to migrate from the ventricular zone to the cortex. Expression analysis using patient-derived cells confirmed reduced TMTC3 transcript levels and loss of the TMTC3 protein compared to parental and control cells. As TMTC3 function is currently unexplored in the brain, we gathered support for a neurobiological role for TMTC3 by generating flies with post-mitotic neuron-specific knockdown of the highly conserved Drosophila melanogaster TMTC3 ortholog, CG4050/tmtc3 . Neuron-specific knockdown of tmtc3 in flies resulted in increased susceptibility to induced seizures. Importantly, this phenotype was rescued by neuron-specific expression of human TMTC3 , suggesting a role for TMTC3 in seizure biology. In addition, we observed co-localization of TMTC3 in the rat brain with vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), a presynaptic marker for inhibitory synapses. TMTC3 is localized at VGAT positive pre-synaptic terminals and boutons in the rat hypothalamus and piriform cortex, suggesting a role for TMTC3 in the regulation of GABAergic inhibitory synapses. TMTC3 did not co-localize with Vglut2, a presynaptic marker for excitatory neurons. Our data identified TMTC3 as a synaptic protein that is involved in PVNH with ID and epilepsy, in addition to its previously described association with cobblestone lissencephaly.",Human molecular genetics,POPGENE
0.688898304,23094243,Algorithm for Primary Full-thickness Skin Grafting in Pediatric Hand Burns,"Background Pediatric hand burns are a difficult problem because they lead to serious hand deformities with functional impairment due to rapid growth during childhood. Therefore, adequate management is required beginning in the acute stage. Our study aims to establish surgical guidelines for a primary full-thickness skin graft (FTSG) in pediatric hand burns, based on long-term observation periods and existing studies. Methods From January 2000 to May 2011, 210 patients underwent primary FTSG. We retrospectively studied the clinical course and treatment outcomes based on the patients' medical records. The patients' demographics, age, sex, injury site of the fingers, presence of web space involvement, the incidence of postoperative late deformities, and the duration of revision were critically analyzed. Results The mean age of the patients was 24.4 months (range, 8 to 94 months), consisting of 141 males and 69 females. The overall observation period was 6.9 years (range, 1 to 11 years) on average. At the time of the burn, 56 cases were to a single finger, 73 to two fingers, 45 to three fingers, and 22 to more than three. Among these cases, 70 were burns that included a web space (33.3%). During the observation, 25 cases underwent corrective operations with an average period of 40.6 months. Conclusions In the volar area, primary full-thickness skin grafting can be a good indication for an isolated injured finger, excluding the web spaces, and injuries of less than three fingers including the web spaces. Also, in the dorsal area, full-thickness skin grafting can be a good indication. However, if the donor site is insufficient and the wound is large, split-thickness skin grafting can be considered.",Archives of plastic surgery,CLINIC
0.960000102,22009316,Thoracic Artificial Lung Impedance Studies Using Computational Fluid Dynamics and  In Vitro  Models," Current thoracic artificial lungs (TALs) possess blood flow impedances greater than the natural lungs, resulting in abnormal pulmonary hemodynamics when implanted. This study sought to reduce TAL impedance using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD was performed on TAL models with inlet and outlet expansion and contraction angles, Œ∏ , of 15¬∞, 45¬∞, and 90¬∞. Pulsatile blood flow was simulated for flow rates of 2‚Äì6 L/min, heart rates of 80 and 100 beats/min, and inlet pulsatilities of 3.75 and 2. Pressure and flow data were used to calculate the zeroth and first harmonic impedance moduli, Z 0 and Z 1 , respectively. The 45¬∞ and 90¬∞ models were also tested in vitro under similar conditions. CFD results indicate Z 0 increases as stroke volume and Œ∏ increase. At 4 L/min, 100 beats/min, and a pulsatility of 3.75, Z 0 was 0.47, 0.61, and 0.79 mmHg/(L/min) for the 15¬∞, 45¬∞, and 90¬∞ devices, respectively. Velocity band and vector plots also indicate better flow patterns in the 45¬∞ device. At the same conditions, in vitro Z 0 were 0.69 ¬± 0.13 and 0.79 ¬± 0.10 mmHg/(L/min), respectively, for the 45¬∞ and 90¬∞ models. These Z 0 are 65% smaller than previous TAL designs. In vitro, Z 1 increased with flow rate but was small and unlikely to significantly affect hemodynamics. The optimal design for flow patterns and low impedance was the 45¬∞ model.

This study evaluated the use of bilingual nurse-delivered telephone counseling in Korean Americans (KAs) participating in a community-based intervention trial to improve management of hypertension.    Methods  KAs were randomized to receive 12 months of hypertension-related telephone counseling that was more intensive (bi-weekly) or less intensive (monthly). Counseling logs were kept for 360 KAs who completed the pre- and post-intervention evaluations.    Results  The overall success rate for the intervention was 80.3%. The level of success was significantly influenced by the dose of counseling, employment status, and years of US residence. Over the 12-month counseling period, both groups showed improvement with regard to medication-taking, alcohol consumption, and exercise but not smoking, with no significant group differences.    Conclusion  Bilingual telephone counseling could reach monolingual KAs and improve their hypertension management behavior.    Practice implications  Bilingual nurse telephone counseling may have wide applicability, serving as an effective means of disseminating evidence-based chronic disease management guidelines to a linguistically isolated community with limited health resources and information.

0.083623774,30813887,mtProtEvol: the resource presenting molecular evolution analysis of proteins involved in the function of Vertebrate mitochondria,"Background Heterotachy is the variation in the evolutionary rate of aligned sites in different parts of the phylogenetic tree. It occurs mainly due to epistatic interactions among the substitutions, which are highly complex and make it difficult to study protein evolution. The vast majority of computational evolutionary approaches for studying these epistatic interactions or their evolutionary consequences in proteins require high computational time. However, recently, it has been shown that the evolution of residue solvent accessibility (RSA) is tightly linked with changes in protein fitness and intra-protein epistatic interactions. This provides a computationally fast alternative, based on comparison of evolutionary rates of amino acid replacements with the rates of RSA evolutionary changes in order to recognize any shifts in epistatic interaction. Results Based on RSA information, data randomization and phylogenetic approaches, we constructed a software pipeline, which¬†can be used to analyze the evolutionary consequences of intra-protein epistatic interactions with relatively low computational time. We analyzed the evolution of 512 protein families tightly linked to mitochondrial function in Vertebrates and created ‚ÄúmtProtEvol‚Äù, the web resource with data on protein evolution. In strict agreement with lifespan and metabolic rate data, we demonstrated that different functional categories of mitochondria-related proteins subjected to selection on accelerated and decelerated RSA rates in rodents and primates. For example, accelerated RSA evolution in rodents has been shown for Krebs cycle enzymes, respiratory chain and reactive oxygen species metabolism, while in primates these functions are stress-response, translation and mtDNA integrity. Decelerated RSA evolution in rodents has been demonstrated for translational machinery and oxidative stress response components. Conclusions mtProtEvol is an interactive resource focused on evolutionary analysis of epistatic interactions in protein families involved in Vertebrata mitochondria function and available at http://bioinfodbs.kantiana.ru/mtProtEvol /.

0.187385256,18371192,Is seeing a specialist nurse associated with positive experiences of care? The role and value of specialist nurses in prostate cancer care,"Background Specialist nurses may play an important role in helping to improve the experiences of patients with prostate cancer, however there is concern that the specialist nurse role is under threat in the UK due to financial pressures in the NHS. This study explored the role and value of specialist nurses in prostate cancer care via a survey and patient interviews. Methods This paper reports findings from two studies. A survey of patients from three hospitals across the UK (289/481, 60%), investigated whether patients who saw a specialist nurse had different experiences of information provision and involvement in decision-making, to those who did not. Qualitative interviews were also carried out with 35 men recently tested or treated for prostate cancer, recruited from two hospitals in the UK. Interviews explored patients' views on the role and value of the specialist nurse. Results Survey findings indicated that patients who saw a specialist nurse had more positive experiences of receiving written information about tests and treatment, and about sources of advice and support, and were more likely to say they made the treatment decision themselves. In interviews, patients described specialist nurse input in their care in terms of providing information and support immediately post-diagnosis, as well as being involved in ongoing care. Two key aspects of the specialist nurse role were seen as unique: their availability to the patient, and their ability to liaise between the patient and the medical system. Conclusion This study indicates the unique role that specialist nurses play in the experience of patients with prostate cancer, and highlights the importance of maintaining specialist nurse roles in prostate cancer care.",BMC health services research,CLINIC
0.157124378,22559942,Tavaxy: Integrating Taverna and Galaxy workflows with cloud computing support,"Background Over the past decade the workflow system paradigm has evolved as an efficient and user-friendly approach for developing complex bioinformatics applications. Two popular workflow systems that have gained acceptance by the bioinformatics community are Taverna and Galaxy. Each system has a large user-base and supports an ever-growing repository of application workflows. However, workflows developed for one system cannot be imported and executed easily on the other. The lack of interoperability is due to differences in the models of computation, workflow languages, and architectures of both systems. This lack of interoperability limits sharing of workflows between the user communities and leads to duplication of development efforts. Results In this paper, we present Tavaxy , a stand-alone system for creating and executing workflows based on using an extensible set of re-usable workflow patterns. Tavaxy offers a set of new features that simplify and enhance the development of sequence analysis applications: It allows the integration of existing Taverna and Galaxy workflows in a single environment, and supports the use of cloud computing capabilities. The integration of existing Taverna and Galaxy workflows is supported seamlessly at both run-time and design-time levels, based on the concepts of hierarchical workflows and workflow patterns. The use of cloud computing in Tavaxy is flexible, where the users can either instantiate the whole system on the cloud, or delegate the execution of certain sub-workflows to the cloud infrastructure. Conclusions Tavaxy reduces the workflow development cycle by introducing the use of workflow patterns to simplify workflow creation. It enables the re-use and integration of existing (sub-) workflows from Taverna and Galaxy, and allows the creation of hybrid workflows. Its additional features exploit recent advances in high performance cloud computing to cope with the increasing data size and complexity of analysis. The system can be accessed either through a cloud-enabled web-interface or downloaded and installed to run within the user's local environment.

0.123002844,29669703,"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Diet-Related eHealth and mHealth Research: Bibliometric Analysis","Background Electronic health (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) approaches to address low physical activity levels, sedentary behavior, and unhealthy diets have received significant research attention. However, attempts to systematically map the entirety of the research field are lacking. This gap can be filled with a bibliometric study, where publication-specific data such as citations, journals, authors, and keywords are used to provide a systematic overview of a specific field. Such analyses will help researchers better position their work. Objective The objective of this review was to use bibliometric data to provide an overview of the eHealth and mHealth research field related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet. Methods The Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection was searched to retrieve all existing and highly cited (as defined by WoS) physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet related eHealth and mHealth research papers published in English between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2016. Retrieved titles were screened for eligibility, using the abstract and full-text where needed. We described publication trends over time, which included journals, authors, and countries of eligible papers, as well as their keywords and subject categories. Citations of eligible papers were compared with those expected based on published data. Additionally, we described highly-cited papers of the field (ie, top ranked 1%). Results The search identified 4805 hits, of which 1712 (including 42 highly-cited papers) were included in the analyses. Publication output increased on an average of 26% per year since 2000, with 49.00% (839/1712) of papers being published between 2014 and 2016. Overall and throughout the years, eHealth and mHealth papers related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet received more citations than expected compared with papers in the same WoS subject categories. The Journal of Medical Internet Research published most papers in the field (9.58%, 164/1712). Most papers originated from high-income countries (96.90%, 1659/1717), in particular the United States (48.83%, 836/1712). Most papers were trials and studied physical activity. Beginning in 2013, research on Generation 2 technologies (eg, smartphones, wearables) sharply increased, while research on Generation 1 (eg, text messages) technologies increased at a reduced pace. Reviews accounted for 20 of the 42 highly-cited papers (n=19 systematic reviews). Social media, smartphone apps, and wearable activity trackers used to encourage physical activity, less sedentary behavior, and/or healthy eating were the focus of 14 highly-cited papers. Conclusions This study highlighted the rapid growth of the eHealth and mHealth physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet research field, emphasized the sizeable contribution of research from high-income countries, and pointed to the increased research interest in Generation 2 technologies.

0.500587236,31110684,Embolism recovery strategies and nocturnal water loss across species influenced by biogeographic origin,"Abstract Drought‚Äêinduced tree mortality is expected to increase in future climates with the potential for significant consequences to global carbon, water, and energy cycles. Xylem embolism can accumulate to lethal levels during drought, but species that can refill embolized xylem and recover hydraulic function may be able to avoid mortality. Yet the potential controls of embolism recovery, including cross‚Äêbiome patterns and plant traits such as nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs), hydraulic traits, and nocturnal stomatal conductance, are unknown. We exposed eight plant species, originating from mesic (tropical and temperate) and semi‚Äêarid environments, to drought under ambient and elevated CO 2 levels, and assessed recovery from embolism following rewatering. We found a positive association between xylem recovery and NSCs, and, surprisingly, a positive relationship between xylem recovery and nocturnal stomatal conductance. Arid‚Äêzone species exhibited greater embolism recovery than mesic zone species. Our results indicate that nighttime stomatal conductance often assumed to be a wasteful use of water, may in fact be a key part of plant drought responses, and contribute to drought survival. Findings suggested distinct biome‚Äêspecific responses that partially depended on species climate‚Äêof‚Äêorigin precipitation or aridity index, which allowed some species to recover from xylem embolism. These findings provide improved understanding required to predict the response of diverse plant communities to drought. Our results provide a framework for predicting future vegetation shifts in response to climate change.",Ecology and evolution,ECO
0.094278236,31484520,Plant composition changes in a small-scale community have a large effect on the performance of an economically important grassland pest,"Background The grasshopper Oedaleus asiaticus Bey-Bienko (Acrididae: Oedipodinae) is a dominant and economically important pest that is widely distributed across the Mongolian plateau. This herbivore pest causes major damage to the grassland of the Inner Mongolian steppe in China. The population dynamics of herbivore pests is affected by grassland management practices (e.g., mowing and heavy livestock grazing) that alter plant community structures and stoichiometric characteristics. For example, O. asiaticus outbreak is closely associated with plant preference changes caused by nitrogen loss from heavy livestock grazing. However, the manner by which small-scale variation in vegetation affects grasshopper performance and promotes outbreak is poorly characterized. To address this question, we investigated the relationship between small-scale (1¬†m 2 ) vegetation variability and measures of O. asiaticus performance associated with plant stoichiometric characteristics. Results We found that food preferences of O. asiaticus varied significantly, but maintained a specific dietary structure for different plant compositions. Notably, small-scale changes in plant community composition significantly affected grasshopper food preference and body size. Partial least-square modeling indicated that plant proportion and biomass affected grasshopper body size and density. We found that this effect differed between sexes. Specifically, female body mass positively correlated with the proportion of Stipa krylovii grass, whereas male mass positively correlated with the proportion of Artemisia frigida grass. Further analyses indicated that grasshopper performance is closely associated with plant stoichiometric traits that might be responsible for the pest‚Äôs plague.

0.466756169,28990242,Blood Utilization in Revision vs. First-time Cardiac Surgery:An Update in the Era of Patient Blood Management,"  Background:  Relative to first time (primary) cardiac surgery, revision cardiac surgery is associated with increased transfusion requirements, but studies comparing these cohorts were done before patient blood management (PBM) and blood conservation measures were commonplace. The current study was done as an update to determine if this finding is still evident in the PBM era.    Methods:  Primary and revision cardiac surgery cases were compared in a retrospective database analysis at a single tertiary care referral center. Two groups of patients were assessed: 1) Those having isolated coronary artery bypass (CAB) or valve surgery, and 2) all other cardiac surgeries. Intraoperative and whole hospital transfusion requirements were assessed for the 4 major blood components.    Results:  Compared to the primary cardiac surgery patients, the revision surgery patients required ‚âà2-fold more transfused units intraoperatively ( P <0.0001), and ‚âà2 to 3-fold more transfused units for the whole hospital stay ( P <0.0001). Intraoperative massive transfusion (>10 red blood cell units) was substantially more frequent with revision vs. primary cardiac surgery; 2.6 vs. 0.1%; P <0.0001 for isolated CAB or valve, and 6.1% vs. 1.9%; P <0.0001 for all other cardiac surgeries. Revision surgery was an independent risk factor for both moderate (6‚Äì10 red blood cell units) and massive intraoperative transfusion.    Conclusions:  In the era of PBM, with restrictive transfusion strategies and a variety of methods for blood conservation, revision cardiac surgery patients continue to have substantially greater transfusion requirements relative to primary cardiac surgery patients. This difference in transfusion requirement was greater than what has been previously reported in the pre-PBM era.  ",Transfusion,CLINIC
0.252606365,26539298,Influence of Deceased Donor and Pretransplant Recipient Parameters on Early Overall Kidney Graft-Survival in Germany," Background . Scarcity of grafts for kidney transplantation (KTX) caused an increased consideration of deceased donors with substantial risk factors. There is no agreement on which ones are detrimental for overall graft-survival. Therefore, we investigated in a nationwide multicentre study the impact of donor and recipient related risks known before KTX on graft-survival based on the original data used for allocation and graft acceptance. Methods . A nationwide deidentified multicenter study-database was created of data concerning kidneys donated and transplanted in Germany between 2006 and 2008 as provided by the national organ procurement organization (Deutsche Stiftung Organtransplantation) and BQS Institute. Multiple Cox regression (significance level 5%, hazard ratio [95% CI]) was conducted ( n = 4411, isolated KTX). Results . Risk factors associated with graft-survival were donor age (1.020 [1.013‚Äì1.027] per year), donor size (0.985 [0.977‚Äì0.993] per cm), donor's creatinine at admission (1.002 [1.001‚Äì1.004] per ¬µ mol/L), donor treatment with catecholamine (0.757 [0.635‚Äì0.901]), and reduced graft-quality at procurement (1.549 [1.217‚Äì1.973]), as well as recipient age (1.012 [1.003‚Äì1.021] per year), actual panel reactive antibodies (1.007 [1.002‚Äì1.011] per percent), retransplantation (1.850 [1.484‚Äì2.306]), recipient's cardiovascular comorbidity (1.436 [1.212‚Äì1.701]), and use of IL2-receptor antibodies for induction (0.741 [0.619‚Äì0.887]).

0.273636974,21937344,Principal Component Based Diffeomorphic Surface Mapping," We present a new diffeomorphic surface mapping algorithm under the framework of large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM). Unlike existing LDDMM approaches, this new algorithm reduces the complexity of the estimation of diffeomorphic transformations by incorporating a shape prior in which a nonlinear diffeomorphic shape space is represented by a linear space of initial momenta of diffeomorphic geodesic flows from a fixed template. In addition, for the first time, the diffeomorphic mapping is formulated within a decision-theoretic scheme based on Bayesian modeling in which an empirical shape prior is characterized by a low dimensional Gaussian distribution on initial momentum. This is achieved using principal component analysis (PCA) to construct the eigenspace of the initial momentum. A likelihood function is formulated as the conditional probability of observing surfaces given any particular value of the initial momentum, which is modeled as a random field of vector-valued measures characterizing the geometry of surfaces. We define the diffeomorphic mapping as a problem that maximizes a posterior distribution of the initial momentum given observable surfaces over the eigenspace of the initial momentum. We demonstrate the stability of the initial momentum eigenspace when altering training samples using a bootstrapping method. We then validate the mapping accuracy and show robustness to outliers whose shape variation is not incorporated into the shape prior. ",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,CS

Samples from the previous study, spanning 800 km, were not able to show whether the southern lineage ultimately goes to fixation at higher latitudes. In addition to expanding the geographic sampling of this species, locations that were sampled approximately four to five generations ago were resampled for this study, enabling a temporal comparison of the location and strength of the observed cline. Here, we show that although the cline persists as expected, the tremendous changes in observed lineage frequencies near the clinal boundary are indicative of source-sink dynamics that may be associated with a codistributed biogeographic transition zone. We also find that the southern lineage does not increase in frequency in more southern populations, suggesting that this lineage is maintained through a combination of density-dependent interactions and a coastal fitness gradient.",Ecology and evolution,ECO

It is unknown whether human cardiomyocytes can restore cardiac function in a physiologically relevant large animal model. Here we show that transplantation of ~750 million cryopreserved human embryonic stem cell‚Äìderived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) enhances cardiac function in macaque monkeys with large myocardial infarctions. One month after hESC-CM transplantation, global left ventricular ejection fraction improved 10.6¬±0.9% vs. 2.5¬±0.8% in controls, and by 3 months there was an additional 12.4% improvement in treated vs. a 3.5% decline in controls. Grafts averaged 11.6% of infarct size, formed electromechanical junctions with the host heart and by 3 months contained ~99% ventricular myocytes. A subset of animals experienced graft-associated ventricular arrhythmias, shown by electrical mapping to originate from a point-source acting as an ectopic pacemaker. Our data demonstrate that remuscularization of the infarcted macaque heart with human myocardium provides durable improvement in left ventricular function. ",Nature biotechnology,ENG
0.846760871,20733236,Incorporating nonlinear relationships in microarray missing value imputation," Microarray gene expression data often contain missing values. Accurate estimation of the missing values is important for down-stream data analyses that require complete data. Nonlinear relationships between gene expression levels have not been well-utilized in missing value imputation. We propose an imputation scheme based on nonlinear dependencies between genes. By simulations based on real microarray data, we show that incorporating non-linear relationships could improve the accuracy of missing value imputation, both in terms of normalized root mean squared error and in terms of the preservation of the list of significant genes in statistical testing. In addition, we studied the impact of artificial dependencies introduced by data normalization on the simulation results. Our results suggest that methods relying on global correlation structures may yield overly optimistic simulation results when the data has been subjected to row (gene) ‚Äì wise mean removal.

0.065456686,26678826,How genome complexity can explain the difficulty of aligning reads to genomes,"Background Although it is frequently observed that aligning short reads to genomes becomes harder if they contain complex repeat patterns, there has not been much effort to quantify the relationship between complexity of genomes and difficulty of short-read alignment. Existing measures of sequence complexity seem unsuitable for the understanding and quantification of this relationship. Results We investigated several measures of complexity and found that length-sensitive measures of complexity had the highest correlation to accuracy of alignment. In particular, the rate of distinct substrings of length k , where k is similar to the read length, correlated very highly to alignment performance in terms of precision and recall. We showed how to compute this measure efficiently in linear time, making it useful in practice to estimate quickly the difficulty of alignment for new genomes without having to align reads to them first. We showed how the length-sensitive measures could provide additional information for choosing aligners that would align consistently accurately on new genomes. Conclusions We formally established a connection between genome complexity and the accuracy of short-read aligners. The relationship between genome complexity and alignment accuracy provides additional useful information for selecting suitable aligners for new genomes. Further, this work suggests that the complexity of genomes sometimes should be thought of in terms of specific computational problems, such as the alignment of short reads to genomes.",BMC bioinformatics,CS
0.808207302,23803466,Prediction of site-specific interactions in antibody-antigen complexes: the proABC method and server,"Motivation: Antibodies or immunoglobulins are proteins of paramount importance in the immune system. They are extremely relevant as diagnostic, biotechnological and therapeutic tools. Their modular structure makes it easy to re-engineer them for specific purposes. Short of undergoing a trial and error process, these experiments, as well as others, need to rely on an understanding of the specific determinants of the antibody binding mode. Results: In this article, we present a method to identify, on the basis of the antibody sequence alone, which residues of an antibody directly interact with its cognate antigen. The method, based on the random forest automatic learning techniques, reaches a recall and specificity as high as 80% and is implemented as a free and easy-to-use server, named prediction of Antibody Contacts. We believe that it can be of great help in re-design experiments as well as a guide for molecular docking experiments. The results that we obtained also allowed us to dissect which features of the antibody sequence contribute most to the involvement of specific residues in binding to the antigen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of our experience with LC for cholelithiasis at our institution, between April 2006 and March 2009 was done. Data points reviewed included patient demographics, clinical history, haematological investigations, imaging studies, operative techniques, postoperative complications, postoperative recovery and final histopathological diagnosis. RESULTS: During the study period of 36 months, 22 children (10 males and 12 females) with cholelithiasis were treated by LC. The mean age was 9.4 years (range 3 to 18 years). Twenty-one children had symptoms of biliary tract disease and one child was incidentally detected with cholelithiasis during an ultrasonogram of the abdomen for an unrelated cause. Only five (22.7%) children had definitive etiological risk factors for cholelithiasis and the remaining 13(77.3%) cases were idiopathic. Twenty cases had pigmented gallstones and two had cholesterol gallstones. All the 22 patients underwent LC, 21 elective and one emergency LC. The mean operative duration was 74.2 minutes (range 50-180 minutes). Postoperative complications occurred in two (9.1%) patients. The average duration of hospital stay was 4.1 days (range 3-6 days). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic chloecystectomy is confirmed to be a safe and efficacious treatment for pediatric cholelithiasis. The cause for an increased incidence of pediatric gallstones and their natural history need to be further evaluated.",Journal of minimal access surgery,CLINIC
0.5784562,29925379,Multi-tissue and multi-scale approach for nuclei segmentation in H&E stained images,"Background Accurate nuclei detection and segmentation in histological images is essential for many clinical purposes. While manual annotations are time-consuming and operator-dependent, full automated segmentation remains a challenging task due to the high variability of cells intensity, size and morphology. Most of the proposed algorithms for the automated segmentation of nuclei were designed for specific organ or tissues. Results The aim of this study was to develop and validate a fully multiscale method, named MANA (Multiscale Adaptive Nuclei Analysis), for nuclei segmentation in different tissues and magnifications. MANA was tested on a dataset of H&E stained tissue images with more than 59,000 annotated nuclei, taken from six organs (colon, liver, bone, prostate, adrenal gland and thyroid) and three magnifications (10√ó, 20√ó, 40√ó). Automatic results were compared with manual segmentations and three open-source software designed for nuclei detection. For each organ, MANA obtained always an F1-score higher than 0.91, with an average F1 of 0.9305‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.0161. The average computational time was about 20¬†s independently of the number of nuclei to be detected (anyway, higher than 1000), indicating the efficiency of the proposed technique. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, MANA is the first fully automated multi-scale and multi-tissue algorithm for nuclei detection. Overall, the robustness and versatility of MANA allowed to achieve, on different organs and magnifications, performances in line or better than those of state-of-art algorithms optimized for single tissues.",Biomedical engineering online,CS

This trial tested the effects of a theory-informed worksheet to facilitate goal setting and action planning, appended to feedback reports on chronic disease management, compared to feedback reports provided without these worksheets. Methods A two-arm pragmatic cluster randomized trial was conducted, with allocation at the level of primary care clinics. Participants were family physicians who contributed data from their electronic medical records. The ‚Äòusual feedback‚Äô arm received feedback every six months for two years regarding the proportion of their patients meeting quality targets for diabetes and/or ischemic heart disease. The intervention arm received these same reports plus a worksheet designed to facilitate goal setting and action plan development in response to the feedback reports. Blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) values were compared after two years as the primary outcomes. Process outcomes measured the proportion of guideline-recommended actions ( e.g. , testing and prescribing) conducted within the appropriate timeframe. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results Outcomes were similar across groups at baseline. Final analysis included 20 physicians from seven clinics and 1,832 patients in the intervention arm (15% loss to follow up) and 29 physicians from seven clinics and 2,223 patients in the usual feedback arm (10% loss to follow up). Ten of 20 physicians completed the worksheet at least once during the study. Mean BP was 128/72 in the feedback plus worksheet arm and 128/73 in the feedback alone arm, while LDL was 2.1 and 2.0, respectively. Thus, no significant differences were observed across groups in the primary outcomes, but mean haemoglobin A1c was lower in the feedback plus worksheet arm (7.2% versus 7.4%, p<0.001). Improvements in both arms were noted over time for one-half of the process outcomes. Discussion Appending a theory-informed goal setting and action planning worksheet to an externally produced audit and feedback intervention did not lead to improvements in patient outcomes. The results may be explained in part by passive dissemination of the worksheet leading to inadequate engagement with the intervention.

Most of the previous multitemplate approaches have built a ‚Äúsuper‚Äù template with very little merging of aligned fragments from different templates. Here, we present a parallelized multitemplate approach, patGPCR, to predict the 3D structures of transmembrane helices of G-protein-coupled receptors. patGPCR, which employs a bundle-packing related energy function that extends on the RosettaMem energy, parallelizes eight pipelines for transmembrane helix refinement and exchanges the optimized helix structures from multiple templates. We have investigated the performance of patGPCR on a test set containing eight determined G-protein-coupled receptors. The results indicate that patGPCR improves the TM RMSD of the predicted models by 33.64% on average against a single-template method.

It is very rare in nature and has not been shown in any nonhuman primate, confounding, as such, any understanding of its precursors and evolution in the human lineage. Here, we describe a vocal phenomenon in a wild great ape with unparalleled affinities with displaced reference. When exposed to predator models, Sumatran orangutan mothers temporarily suppressed alarm calls up to 20 min until the model was out of sight. Subjects delayed their vocal responses in function of perceived danger for themselves, but four major predictions for stress-based mechanisms were not met. Conversely, vocal delay was also a function of perceived danger for another‚Äîan infant‚Äîsuggesting high-order cognition.

0.065752556,19026314,"Dynamic Changes of Left Ventricular Performance and Left Atrial Volume Induced by the Mueller Maneuver in Healthy Young Adults and Implications for Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Atrial Fibrillation and Heart Failure"," Using the Mueller maneuver (MM) to simulate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), we sought to investigate the acute changes in left sided heart morphology and function that develop with apneas occurring during sleep. Strong evidence supports a relationship between OSA and both atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF). However, the acute effects of airway obstruction on cardiac structure and function have not been well defined. In addition, it is unclear how OSA might contribute to the development of AF and HF. We utilized echocardiography in healthy young adults to measure various parameters of cardiac structure and function. Subjects were studied at baseline, during and immediately after performance of the MM, and after a 10 minute recovery. Continuous heart rate, blood pressure and pulse oximetry measurements were made. During the MM, left atrial (LA) volume index markedly decreased. Left ventricular (LV) end systolic dimension increased in association with a decrement in LV ejection fraction. On release of the maneuver, there was a compensatory increase in blood flow to the left side of the heart with stroke volume, ejection fraction and cardiac output exceeding baseline. After 10 minutes of recovery all parameters had returned to baseline. In conclusion, sudden imposition of severe negative intrathoracic pressure leads to an abrupt decrease in LA volume and a decrease in LV systolic performance. These changes reflect an increase in LV afterload. Repeated swings in afterload burden and chamber volumes may have implications for future development of AF and HF.

0.662793297,24253542,Longitudinal Effects of a Decade of Aging on Carotid Artery Stiffness: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis,"  Background and Purpose  Arterial stiffening is associated with hypertension, stroke, and cognitive decline; however, the effects of aging and cardiovascular disease risk factors on carotid artery stiffening have not been assessed prospectively in a large multi-ethnic, longitudinal study.    Methods  Distensibility coefficient and Young‚Äôs elastic modulus of the right common carotid artery were calculated at baseline and after a mean (standard deviation) of 9.4 (0.5) years in 2,650 participants. Effects of age and cardiovascular disease risk factors were evaluated by multivariable mixed regression and analysis of covariance models.    Results  At baseline, participants were 59.9 (9.4) years old (53% female; 25% Black, 22% Hispanic, 14% Chinese). Young‚Äôs elastic modulus increased from 1,581 (927) to 1,749 (1,306) mmHg (p<0.0001) and distensibility coefficient decreased from 3.1 (1.3) to 2.7 (1.1) x 10 ‚àí3 mmHg ‚àí1 (p<0.001), indicating progressive arterial stiffening. Young‚Äôs elastic modulus increased more among participants who were >75 years old at baseline (p<0.0001). In multivariable analyses, older age and less education independently predicted worsening Young‚Äôs elastic modulus and distensibility coefficient. Stopping antihypertensive medication during the study period predicted more severe worsening of Young‚Äôs elastic modulus (Œ≤=360.2 mmHg, p=0.008). Starting antihypertensive medication after exam 1 was predictive of improvements in distensibility coefficient (Œ≤ =1.1 x 10 ‚àí4 , mmHg ‚àí1 ; p=0.024).    Conclusions  Arterial stiffening accelerates with advanced age. Older individuals experience greater increases in Young‚Äôs elastic modulus than do younger adults, even after considering the effects of traditional risk factors. Treating hypertension may slow the progressive decline in carotid artery distensibility observed with aging and improve cerebrovascular health.  ",Stroke,EPIDEM

Here, we investigated the changes of plant growth, antioxidant capacity, glandular trichome density, and volatile exudates of S. tenuifolia exposed to salt stress (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 mM NaCl). Results showed that its dry biomass was reduced by salt treatments except 25 mM NaCl.

On leaf surfaces, big peltate and small capitate glandular trichomes (GTs) were found. Salt treatments, especially at moderate and severe concentrations, enhanced the density of total GTs on both leaf sides. The most abundant compound in GT volatile exudates was pulegone. Under salinity, relative contents of this component and other monoterpenes decreased significantly; biosynthesis and accumulation of esters were enhanced, particularly sulfurous acid,2-ethylhexyl hexyl ester, which became the second major compound as salinity increased.

0.513457175,23468603,The HAMP Signal Relay Domain Adopts Multiple Conformational States through Collective Piston and Tilt Motions,"The HAMP domain is a linker region in prokaryotic sensor proteins and relays input signals to the transmitter domain and vice versa. Functional as a dimer, the structure of HAMP shows a parallel coiled-coil motif comprising four helices. To date, it is unclear how HAMP can relay signals from one domain to another, although several models exist. In this work, we use molecular simulation to test the hypothesis that HAMP adopts different conformations, one of which represents an active, signal-relaying configuration, and another an inactive, resting state. We first performed molecular dynamics simulation on the prototype HAMP domain Af1503 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus . We explored its conformational space by taking the structure of the A291F mutant disabling HAMP activity as a starting point. These simulations revealed additional conformational states that differ in the tilt angles between the helices as well as the relative piston shifts of the helices relative to each other. By enhancing the sampling in a metadynamics set up, we investigated three mechanistic models for HAMP signal transduction. Our results indicate that HAMP can access additional conformational states characterized by piston motion. Furthermore, the piston motion of the N-terminal helix of one monomer is directly correlated with the opposite piston motion of the C-terminal helix of the other monomer. The change in piston motion is accompanied by a change in tilt angle between the monomers, thus revealing that HAMP exhibits a collective motion, i.e. a combination of changes in tilt angles and a piston-like displacement. Our results provide insights into the conformational changes that underlie the signaling mechanism involving HAMP. Author Summary For survival, bacteria must constantly monitor their environmental conditions and adapt to these by generating a response. Protein sensors enable bacteria to perceive their surroundings and are typically built from modular compounds that are connected by linker regions. The HAMP domain is such a linker region that relays signals between different modules in a sensory cascade. HAMP is a dimer comprising four helices in a parallel coiled-coil interaction motif. One of the hypotheses explaining the mechanism of signal communication by HAMP is that the domain can adopt different stable conformations. In this work, we used a molecular simulation approach to investigate this hypothesis at high atomic resolution. We found that HAMP can adopt different conformations and that, in doing so, the helices shift and tilt with respect to each other. Furthermore, we found that if one helix moves upward, the helix at the other end in the other monomer moves down.",PLoS computational biology,CS

We investigated the mechanisms underlying glucose-triggered activity in glucose-excited (GE) neurons, using primary cultures of rat hypothalamic neurons monitored by fluorescence calcium imaging. 35% (738/2139) of neurons were excited by increasing glucose from 3 to 15mM, but only 9% (6/64) of these GE neurons were activated by tolbutamide, suggesting the involvement of a K ATP channel-independent mechanism. Œ±-Methylglucopyranoside (Œ±MDG, 12mM), a non-metabolisable substrate of sodium glucose co-transporters (SGLTs), mimicked the effect of high glucose in 67% of GE neurons, and both glucose and Œ±MDG-triggered excitation were blocked by Na + removal or by the SGLT inhibitor, phloridzin (100nM). In the presence of 0.5mM glucose and tolbutamide, responses could also be triggered by 3.5mM Œ±MDG, supporting a role for an SGLT-associated mechanism at low as well as high substrate concentrations. By RT-PCR, we detected SGLT1, SGLT3a, SGLT3b in both cultured neurons and adult rat hypothalamus. Our findings suggest a novel role for SGLTs in glucose-sensing by hypothalamic GE neurons.

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the retention of pit and fissure sealants placed using acid etch alone and a combination of air abrasion and acid etch techniques. Material and Methods 50 subjects aged 6-8 years were included in the study. Primary second molars and permanent first molars were sealed in all four quadrants using split mouth design. The right maxillary and mandibular molars (Group A) were treated by acid etching alone while the left maxillary and mandibular molars (Group B) were pretreated with air abrasion followed by acid etching before application of pit and fissure sealant. Retention of sealants was checked using Simonsen‚Äôs criteria of sealant retention after three and six months of sealant application. Results There was no significant difference in retention of sealants in Group A and Group B ( p <0.05) after three and six months follow up. The difference in sealant retention in primary and permanent molars was not significant ( p >0.05). Maxillary molars showed superior retention compared to mandibular molars, which was statistically significant at both three and six months ( p <0.05). Conclusions Combining air abrasion pretreatment with subsequent acid etching did not result in statistically significant difference in sealant retention compared to acid etching alone in both primary and permanent molars after 3 and 6 months follow up.

0.438915969,22440642,Is optical imaging spectroscopy a viable measurement technique for the investigation of the negative BOLD phenomenon? A concurrent optical imaging spectroscopy and  f MRI study at high field (7¬†T),"Traditionally functional magnetic resonance imaging ( f MRI) has been used to map activity in the human brain by measuring increases in the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. Often accompanying positive BOLD f MRI signal changes are sustained negative signal changes. Previous studies investigating the neurovascular coupling mechanisms of the negative BOLD phenomenon have used concurrent 2D-optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS) and electrophysiology (Boorman et al., 2010). These experiments suggested that the negative BOLD signal in response to whisker stimulation was a result of an increase in deoxy-haemoglobin and reduced multi-unit activity in the deep cortical layers. However, Boorman et al. (2010) did not measure the BOLD and haemodynamic response concurrently and so could not quantitatively compare either the spatial maps or the 2D-OIS and fMRI time series directly. Furthermore their study utilised a homogeneous tissue model in which is predominantly sensitive to haemodynamic changes in more superficial layers. Here we test whether the 2D-OIS technique is appropriate for studies of negative BOLD. We used concurrent f MRI with 2D-OIS techniques for the investigation of the haemodynamics underlying the negative BOLD at 7 Tesla. We investigated whether optical methods could be used to accurately map and measure the negative BOLD phenomenon by using 2D-OIS haemodynamic data to derive predictions from a biophysical model of BOLD signal changes. We showed that despite the deep cortical origin of the negative BOLD response, if an appropriate heterogeneous tissue model is used in the spectroscopic analysis then 2D-OIS can be used to investigate the negative BOLD phenomenon.",NeuroImage,NEURO

Methods: In total, 38 patients previously diagnosed with Turner syndrome (TS) and 35 healthy girls (controls) were included in our cross-sectional study. Twelve-lead electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography after a 30-min rest were performed. The QT, QTc, QTd, Tp-Te interval, and Tp-Te/QTc ratio were determined. Results: No differences in age or sex were observed between the groups.

Guidelines on DVT prophylaxis are therefore derived from expert opinion. We sought to determine the rate of thromboembolic complications after sling surgery for stress urinary incontinence among female Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and over.    Methods  We analyzed the 1999‚Äì2001 Medicare Public Use Files provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on a 5% national random sample of beneficiaries. Women undergoing sling procedures between January 1, 1999 and July 31, 2000 were identified by CPT-4 codes and tracked for 12 months. Diagnoses of postoperative thromboembolism (DVT/PE) were identified with ICD-9 codes. Multivariate analysis determined independent risk factors for developing a thromboembolic event.    Results  A total of 1,356 slings were performed in the 5% sample of female Medicare beneficiaries during the 18-month index period. Concomitant prolapse surgery was performed in 467 (34.4%) cases. At three months after surgery, thromboembolic complications had occurred in 0.9% of women undergoing a sling alone and in 2.2% of women undergoing concomitant prolapse surgery (p=0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that concomitant prolapse surgery was associated with nearly three times the odds of thromboembolic complications (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.10-7.45).    Conclusions  A low rate of thromboembolism occurred after an isolated sling procedure. However, the increased rate of DVT and PE among women undergoing sling surgery combined with prolapse repair emphasizes the need for appropriate DVT prophylaxis in this group.  ",Urology,CLINIC

Sixty days old seedlings of Neem ( Azadirachta indica A. Juss) raised in root trainers were inoculated with six species of AMF and a mixed inoculum (consortia) and kept in green house. Performances of the treatments on this tree species were evaluated in terms of growth parameters like plant height shoot collar diameter, biomass and phosphorous uptake capabilities. Significant and varied increase in the growth parameters and phosphorous uptake was observed for most of the AMF species against control. Consortia culture was found to be the best suited AMF treatment for A. indica , while Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae were the best performing single species cultures. It is the first time in the state of Gujarat that a wide variety of AMF species, isolated from the typical semi-arid region of western India, were tested for the best growth performance with one of the most important tree species for the concerned region.",Brazilian journal of microbiology : [publication of the Brazilian Society for Microbiology],ANIMAL
0.672590161,24104765,Cilioplasm is a cellular compartment for calcium signaling in response to mechanical and chemical stimuli," Primary cilia with a diameter of ~200 nm have been implicated in development and disease. Calcium signaling within a primary cilium has never been directly visualized and has therefore remained a speculation. Fluid-shear stress and dopamine receptor type-5 (DR5) agonist are among the few stimuli that require cilia for intracellular calcium signal transduction. However, it is not known if these stimuli initiate calcium signaling within the cilium, or if the calcium signal originates in the cytoplasm. Using an integrated single-cell imaging technique, we demonstrate for the first time that calcium signaling triggered by fluid-shear stress initiates in the primary cilium and can be distinguished from the subsequent cytosolic calcium response through the ryanodine receptor. Importantly, this flow-induced calcium signaling depends on the ciliary polycystin-2 calcium channel. While DR5-specific agonist induces calcium signaling mainly in the cilioplasm via ciliary CaV1.2, thrombin specifically induces cytosolic calcium signaling through the IP 3 receptor. Furthermore, a non-specific calcium ionophore triggers both ciliary and cytosolic calcium responses. We suggest that cilia not only act as sensory organelles but also function as calcium signaling compartments. Cilium-dependent signaling can spread to the cytoplasm or be contained within the cilioplasm. Our study also provides the first model to understand signaling within the cilioplasm of a living cell.

However, injury has been found to increase with socioeconomic disadvantage for some injuries. The current study examines the 10-year epidemiological profile of injury hospitalisations of children ‚â§16‚Äâyears by socioeconomic status for different age group and select types of injury. Method A retrospective analysis of injury hospitalisations of children aged ‚â§16‚Äâyears using linked hospitalisation and mortality records during 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2012 was conducted. Negative binomial regression was used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for injury hospitalisation rates by socioeconomic disadvantage quintile. Results There were 679,171 injury hospitalisations for children aged 0‚Äì16‚Äâyears in Australia. Children in more disadvantaged socioeconomic quintiles were more likely to be hospitalised for an injury sustained by: assault (IRR range 1.40 to 3.64), poisoning (IRR range 1.29 to 1.36), heat and hot substances (IRR range 1.07 to 1.34), and pedestrian collisions (IRR range 1.06 to 1.54) than children in advantaged socioeconomic quintiles. Conclusions Findings support the notion that the risk of injury hospitalisation among children differs according to socioeconomic gradient and has implications for childhood injury prevention. Policy makers should consider socioeconomic differences in the design of injury prevention measures, particularly measures directed at modifying the built environment and home-based interventions.",BMC public health,EPIDEM

One of the most effective ways to rapidly obtain an overview of genomic alterations in large amounts of genomic data is the integrative visualization of genomic events. Results We developed FISH Oracle 2, a web server for the interactive visualization of different kinds of downstream processed genomics data typically available in cancer research. A powerful search interface and a fast visualization engine provide a highly interactive visualization for such data. High quality image export enables the life scientist to easily communicate their results. A comprehensive data administration allows to keep track of the available data sets. We applied FISH Oracle 2 to published data and found evidence that, in colorectal cancer cells, the gene TTC28 may be inactivated in two different ways, a fact that has not been published before. Conclusions The interactive nature of FISH Oracle 2 and the possibility to store, select and visualize large amounts of downstream processed data support life scientists in generating hypotheses.

Recent findings  Thyroid cancer behavior is defined by the effects of the initiating oncogene as well as secondary events in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment that are both genetic and epigenetic. These events together play an important role in regulating thyroid cancer behavior. Over the past several years, there has been intense focus on identifying molecular markers to better predict the aggressiveness of thyroid cancers and also define therapeutic targets. The results of recent articles in this area of work are summarized with a focus of differentiated follicular-cell derived forms of thyroid cancer.    Summary  Clinical staging predicts tumor behavior in many cases, but does not allow for true ‚Äúpersonalization‚Äù of initial therapy or identify potential therapeutic targets for patients with progressive disease that does not respond to standard therapies. Recent data point to several new opportunities to refine thyroid cancer treatment based on molecular information. Several highlighted articles have begun to apply this information with clinical intent.  ","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",IMMUN
0.642628722,23926094,High Disease Activity May Not Be Sufficient to Escalate Care,"  Background  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment regimens are not adjusted in response to active disease as frequently as indicated. The objective of this study was to examine how disease activity and patients‚Äô illness beliefs combine to predict future treatment changes in patients who are currently under the care of a rheumatologist.    Methods  We interviewed RA patients at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 months. We examined the association of disease activity (RAPID-4) and five specific illness beliefs (consequences, treatment control, symptom burden, concern, emotional impact) with future escalation of treatment using logistic regression. Analyses were adjusted for age, current biologic use, and disease duration. Disease activity and illness beliefs were dichotomized at the median to create four dummy variables (e.g. Low disease activity + High illness belief) in order to examine the combined impact of disease activity and illness beliefs on escalation.    Results  Twenty-nine percent of the participants (N=142) had an escalation of treatment during the follow-up period. When examined separately, disease activity and four of the illness beliefs (consequences, symptom burden, concern, and emotional impact) were associated with future escalation. High disease activity was predictive of future escalation only when combined with high levels of consequences, concern, and emotional impact. The combinations of high disease activity and high consequences, concern, and emotional impact were much stronger predictors or future escalation than either factor in isolation.    Conclusions  The findings suggest that patients‚Äô illness beliefs are an important determinant of treatment decisions which are not fully captured by disease activity measures alone.

0.666085767,29150105,"For survival, the emergence of oligoclonal bands after multiple myeloma treatment is less important than achieving complete remission","Background The emergence of oligoclonal bands, proteins differing from those originally identified at diagnosis, has been reported in multiple myeloma patients after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and after successful conventional chemotherapy. The clinical relevance of oligoclonal bands remains unclear, but their emergence has been associated with better prognosis. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence, clinical characteristics and prognostic impact of the presence of oligoclonal bands in multiple myeloma patients. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted. The study included newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with at least very good partial response after conventional dose or high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. The emergence of oligoclonal bands was identified using serum protein electrophoresis as well as serum and urine immunofixation techniques. Results A total of 101 patients were included with a median follow-up of 42 months. In total, 55% were male, and the median age was 58 years (29‚Äì87 years). Fifty-one (50.5%) patients developed oligoclonal bands. They comprised 60% (45/75) of patients treated with autologous stem cell transplantation and 23% (6/26) of those who were not transplanted. Patients with oligoclonal bands showed better progression-free survival than those without the emergence of oligoclonal bands ( p -value¬†=¬†0.0075). Conclusion The prevalence of oligoclonal bands in this study population was 50.5% with its frequency being greater in cases treated with autologous stem cell transplantation and in those attaining complete remission.

0.962180262,15588327,Proportional odds ratio model for comparison of diagnostic tests in meta-analysis,"Background Consider a meta-analysis where a 'head-to-head' comparison of diagnostic tests for a disease of interest is intended. Assume there are two or more tests available for the disease, where each test has been studied in one or more papers. Some of the papers may have studied more than one test, hence the results are not independent. Also the collection of tests studied may change from one paper to the other, hence incomplete matched groups. Methods We propose a model, the proportional odds ratio (POR) model, which makes no assumptions about the shape of OR p , a baseline function capturing the way OR changes across papers. The POR model does not assume homogeneity of ORs, but merely specifies a relationship between the ORs of the two tests. One may expand the domain of the POR model to cover dependent studies, multiple outcomes, multiple thresholds, multi-category or continuous tests, and individual-level data. Results In the paper we demonstrate how to formulate the model for a few real examples, and how to use widely available or popular statistical software (like SAS, R or S-Plus, and Stata) to fit the models, and estimate the discrimination accuracy of tests. Furthermore, we provide code for converting ORs into other measures of test performance like predictive values, post-test probabilities, and likelihood ratios, under mild conditions. Also we provide code to convert numerical results into graphical ones, like forest plots, heterogeneous ROC curves, and post test probability difference graphs. Conclusions The flexibility of POR model, coupled with ease with which it can be estimated in familiar software, suits the daily practice of meta-analysis and improves clinical decision-making.",BMC medical research methodology,CLINIC
0.879447687,18981919,Is There Evidence for Continued Learning Over Multiple Years in Perimetry?,"  Purpose  The existence of learning effects in perimetry, whereby a subject‚Äôs first test is more variable and has lower mean sensitivity (MS) than subsequent tests, is well established. However, studies have typically examined this issue by testing subjects at a frequency that would be unusual in a clinical setting. This study seeks to determine the validity of these conclusions for less frequent, yet more clinically realistic, testing rates.    Methods  One hundred sixty eyes of 80 subjects with suspected or early glaucoma were included. Subjects were tested annually for 8 years using white-on-white standard automated perimetry (SAP) and short wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP). All subjects had undergone at least one test with both paradigms before entering the study.    Results  For SAP, MS increased by 0.5 dB over the first year, and then showed no significant change until after year 5 (despite expected effects of aging and disease progression), after which it started to decline. For SWAP, MS of the average eye continued to improve until year 6 of the study.    Conclusions  Our findings seem to indicate a prolonged learning effect for SWAP, with MS increasing for several years. A smaller prolonged learning effect may also be present for SAP, counteracting the effects of aging and disease progression. Deterioration of the subject‚Äôs visual field may be underestimated within this period.  ",Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,CLINIC

Design:  Clinicopathologic correlation.    Subjects:  Patients with metastatic UM to the liver.    Methods  A retrospective review of MRI images of patients with metastatic UM to the liver at a single institution between 2004-2016 was performed. The MRI growth patterns were classified as nodular or diffuse. The histopathologic findings in core liver biopsies of liver metastases identified by needle localization in a subset of these patients were reviewed. The core samples were evaluated by routine light microscopy including immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent staining for CD31, CD105 and HMB45 and classified as exhibiting an infiltrative or nodular growth pattern.    Outcome measures:  MRI images and core biopsy findings.    Results  Thirty-two patients were identified with metastatic UM to the liver that was imaged by MRI and 127 lesions were identified. There were 46 lesions that were classified by MRI as infiltrative and 81 as nodular. There were 9 needle-localized core biopsies that corresponded to MRI-imaged metastatic lesions. Of these 9 lesions, 3 that were classified as infiltrative on MRI exhibited a stage I infiltrative histologic growth patterns; of the remaining 6 that were classified as nodular by MRI, 5 histologically demonstrated stage II or stage III infiltrative growth patterns and 1 histologically demonstrated a nodular growth pattern.    Conclusions  MRI hepatic infiltrative growth patterns of metastatic UM corresponded to stage I histologic infiltrative growth in the sinusoidal spaces whereas MRI nodular growth patterns corresponded to either stage II/ III histologic infiltrative growth that replaced the hepatic lobule or histologic nodular growth in the portal triad that effaced adjacent hepatic parenchyma.

Future development of cachexia treatment needs methods for early identification of patients at risk. The aim of the study was to validate nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with cachexia, and to explore 182 other candidate SNPs with the potential to be involved in the pathophysiology. Method: A total of 1797 cancer patients, classified as either having severe cachexia, mild cachexia or no cachexia, were genotyped. Results: After allowing for multiple testing, there was no statistically significant association between any of the SNPs analysed and the cachexia groups. However, consistent with prior reports, two SNPs from the acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH) gene showed suggestive statistical significance ( P =0.02; OR, 0.78). Conclusion: This study failed to detect any significant association between any of the SNPs analysed and cachexia; although two SNPs from the APEH gene had a trend towards significance. The APEH gene encodes the enzyme APEH, postulated to be important in the endpoint of the ubiquitin system and thus the breakdown of proteins into free amino acids. In cachexia, there is an extensive breakdown of muscle proteins and an increase in the production of acute phase proteins in the liver.",British journal of cancer,IMMUN
0.127255314,22225431,Screening for elder mistreatment in dental and medical clinics,"  Objective  Elder mistreatment (EM) is a potentially fatal and largely unrecognised problem in the United States. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of EM in busy clinics and specifically, we report on the feasibility of screening for EM as well as the appropriate instrumentation for screening.    Background Data  Prevalence estimates for elder mistreatment vary, but recent data from a national sample of community-residing adults over age 60 indicate that 11.4% of older adults report some form of elder mistreatment ( 1 ). There is a paucity of research related to screening in dental and medical clinics to understand the prevalence in such practice settings.    Methods  A cross-sectional study from January 2008 to March 2009. We enrolled 241 patients at two clinics: a medical clinic (N=102) and the dental clinics (N=139). A mini-mental status exam was conducted with a minimum of 18 or better for inclusion. An elder mistreatment screen was next used (EAI-R for medical, HS-EAST for dental).    Results  For the 241 patients, we were able to compare data from the EAI-R with the HS-EAST. This pilot work demonstrates the feasibility of screening for EM in busy clinics and we documented patient enrolment of 20% in the medical clinics, and 66% in dental clinics. Patients are willing to answer extremely-sensitive questions related to elder mistreatment, and are also willing to use computer technology for interviewing.    Conclusion  Dental and medical clinics are important practice venues to screen for elder mistreatment.  ",Gerodontology,CLINIC

0.545978201,28475766,Sak and Sak4 recombinases are required for bacteriophage replication in  Staphylococcus aureus,"Abstract DNA-single strand annealing proteins (SSAPs) are recombinases frequently encoded in the genome of many bacteriophages. As SSAPs can promote homologous recombination among DNA substrates with an important degree of divergence, these enzymes are involved both in DNA repair and in the generation of phage mosaicisms. Here, analysing Sak and Sak4 as representatives of two different families of SSAPs present in phages infecting the clinically relevant bacterium Staphylococcus aureus , we demonstrate for the first time that these enzymes are absolutely required for phage reproduction. Deletion of the genes encoding these enzymes significantly reduced phage replication and the generation of infectious particles. Complementation studies revealed that these enzymes are required both in the donor (after prophage induction) and in the recipient strain (for infection). Moreover, our results indicated that to perform their function SSAPs require the activity of their cognate single strand binding (Ssb) proteins. Mutational studies demonstrated that the Ssb proteins are also required for phage replication, both in the donor and recipient strain. In summary, our results expand the functions attributed to the Sak and Sak4 proteins, and demonstrate that both SSAPs and Ssb proteins are essential for the life cycle of temperate staphylococcal phages.",Nucleic acids research,BIOCHEM

0.153105083,26477039,Methods for Health Economic Evaluation of Vaccines and Immunization Decision Frameworks: A Consensus Framework from a European Vaccine Economics Community,"Background Incremental cost-effectiveness  and cost-utility analyses [health economic evaluations (HEEs)] of vaccines are routinely considered in decision making on immunization in various industrialized countries. While guidelines advocating more standardization of such HEEs (mainly for curative drugs) exist, several immunization-specific aspects (e.g. indirect effects or discounting approach) are still a subject of debate within the scientific community. Objective The objective of this study was to develop a consensus framework for HEEs of vaccines to support the development of national guidelines in Europe. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify prevailing issues related to HEEs of vaccines. Furthermore, European experts in the field of health economics and immunization decision making were nominated and asked to select relevant aspects for discussion. Based on this, a workshop was held with these experts. Aspects on ‚Äòmathematical modelling‚Äô, ‚Äòhealth economics‚Äô and ‚Äòdecision making‚Äô were debated in group-work sessions (GWS) to formulate recommendations and/or‚Äîif applicable‚Äîto state ‚Äòpros‚Äô and ‚Äòcontras‚Äô. Results A total of 13 different aspects were identified for modelling and HEE: model selection, time horizon of models, natural disease history, measures of vaccine-induced protection, duration of vaccine-induced protection, indirect effects apart from herd protection, target population, model calibration and validation, handling uncertainty, discounting, health-related quality of life, cost components, and perspectives. For decision making, there were four aspects regarding the purpose and the integration of HEEs of vaccines in decision making as well as the variation of parameters within uncertainty analyses and the reporting of results from HEEs. For each aspect, background information and an expert consensus were formulated. Conclusions There was consensus that when HEEs are used to prioritize healthcare funding, this should be done in a consistent way across all interventions, including vaccines. However, proper evaluation of vaccines implies using tools that are not commonly used for therapeutic drugs. Due to the complexity of and uncertainties around vaccination, transparency in the documentation of HEEs and during subsequent decision making is essential.",PharmacoEconomics,EPIDEM

0.967005408,27587023,Activation of the EIF2Œ±/ATF4 and ATF6 Pathways in DU-145 Cells by Boric Acid at the Concentration Reported in Men at the US Mean Boron Intake,"Fruits, nuts, legumes, and vegetables are rich sources of boron (B), an essential plant nutrient with chemopreventive properties. Blood boric acid (BA) levels reflect recent B intake, and men at the US mean intake have a reported non-fasting level of 10¬†ŒºM. Treatment of DU-145 prostate cancer cells with physiological concentrations of BA inhibits cell proliferation without causing apoptosis and activates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2Œ±). EIF2Œ± induces cell differentiation and protects cells by redirecting gene expression to manage endoplasmic reticulum stress. Our objective was to determine the temporal expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-activated genes in DU-145 prostate cells treated with 10¬†ŒºM BA. Immunoblots showed post-treatment increases in eIF2Œ± protein at 30¬†min and ATF4 and ATF6 proteins at 1¬†h and 30¬†min, respectively. The increase in ATF4 was accompanied by an increase in the expression of its downstream genes growth arrest and DNA damage-induced protein 34 (GADD34) and homocysteine-induced ER protein (Herp), but a decrease in GADD153/CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), a pro-apoptotic gene. The increase in ATF6 was accompanied by an increase in expression of its downstream genes GRP78/BiP, calreticulin, Grp94, and EDEM. BA did not activate IRE1 or induce cleavage of XBP1 mRNA, a target of IRE1. Low boron status has been associated with increased cancer risk, low bone mineralization, and retinal degeneration. ATF4 and BiP/GRP78 function in osteogenesis and bone remodeling, calreticulin is required for tumor suppressor p53 function and mineralization of teeth, and BiP/GRP78 and EDEM prevent the aggregation of misfolded opsins which leads to retinal degeneration. The identification of BA-activated genes that regulate its phenotypic effects provides a molecular underpinning for boron nutrition and biology.

However, the extent of the problem in low-income countries like Sub-Saharan Africa is unclear. We assessed the magnitude and disparity of both phenomena by place of residence, level of education and wealth quintile using cross-sectional data from 32 countries. Methods Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data collected in 32 Sub-Saharan African countries between January 2005 and December 2013 were used. A total of 250651 women (aged 15‚Äì49 years) were analyzed. Trained personnel using a standardized procedure measured body weight and height. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing body weight by height squared. Prevalence of overweight (25.0‚Äì29.9¬†kg/m 2 ) and obesity (‚â•30.0¬†kg/m2) were estimated for each country. Analysis of the relationships of overweight and obesity with place of residence, education and wealth index were carried out using logistic regression. Results The pooled prevalence of overweight for the region was 15.9¬†% (95¬†% CI, 15.7‚Äì16.0) with the lowest in Madagascar 5.6¬†% (95¬†% CI, 5.1‚Äì6.1) and the highest in Swaziland 27.7¬†% (95¬†% CI, 26.4‚Äì29.0).

Vam7p is recruited to vacuoles by its N-terminal PX domain that specifically recognizes PtdIns(3)P in the bilayers, however the precise mechanism of membrane anchoring remains unclear. Here we describe a molecular basis for membrane targeting and penetration by the Vam7p PX domain based on structural and quantitative analysis of its interactions with lipids and micelles. Our results derived from in vitro binding measurements using NMR, monolayer surface tension experiments and mutagenesis reveal a multivalent membrane docking mechanism involving specific PtdIns(3)P recognition that is facilitated by electrostatic interactions and accompanying hydrophobic insertion. Both the hydrophobic and electrostatic components enhance the Vam7p PX domain association with PtdIns(3)P-containing membranes. The inserting Val 70 , Leu 71 , and Trp 75 residues located next to the PtdIns(3)P binding pocket are surrounded by a basic patch, which is involved in nonspecific electrostatic contacts with acidic lipids, such as PtdSer. Substitution of the insertion residues significantly reduces the binding and penetrating power of the Vam7p PX domain and leads to cytoplasmic redistribution of the EGFP-tagged protein. The affinities of the PX domain for PtdIns(3)P and other lipids reveal a remarkable synergy within the multivalent complex that stably anchors Vam7p at the vacuolar membrane.

We recruited 118 pregnant women, between 25 and 34 years of age, at the obstetric clinic. Personal data collected included reproductive and medical histories and physical factors. Clinicians gathered placental and umbilical cord serum upon delivery and carefully scored the 118 newborns, making both structural and functional assessments. We analyzed placentas for 17 polychlorinated dibenzo- p -dioxins and dibenzofurans and 12 dioxin-like PCB congeners with the World Health Organization‚Äìdefined toxic equivalent factors, and six indicator PCBs by high-resolution gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. We analyzed thyroid and growth hormones from cord serum using radioimmunoassay. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-binding globulin-3, and thyroxine √ó yroid-stimulating hormone (T 4 √ó TSH) were significantly associated with increased placental weight and Quetelet index (in kilograms per square meter; correlation coefficient r = 0.2‚Äì0.3; p < 0.05). Multivariate analyses showed independently and significantly decreased free T 4 (FT 4 ) √ó TSH with increasing non- ortho PCBs ( r = ‚àí0.2; p < 0.05). We suggest that significant FT 4 feedback alterations to the hypothalamus result from in utero exposure to non- ortho PCBs. Considering the vast existence of bioaccumulated dioxins and PCBs and the resultant body burden in modern society, we suggest routine screening of both thyroid hormone levels and thyroid function in newborns.",Environmental health perspectives,ENVIRON
0.55114043,28352731,Artifacts reduction in strain maps of tagged magnetic resonance imaging using harmonic phase,Tagged Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive technique for examining myocardial function and deformation. Tagged MRI can also be used in quasi-static MR elastography to acquire strain maps of other biological soft tissues. Harmonic phase (HARP) provides automatic and rapid analysis of tagged MR images for the quantification and visualization of myocardial strain. We propose a new artifact reduction method in strain maps. Image intensity of the DC component is estimated and subtracted from spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM) tagged MR images. DC peak interference in harmonic phase extraction is greatly reduced after DC component subtraction. The proposed method is validated using both simulated and MR acquired tagged images. Strain maps are obtained with better accuracy and smoothness after DC component subtraction.,"Open medicine (Warsaw, Poland)",ENG

Targeting the Onchocerca volvulus Wolbachia endosymbionts with doxycycline is effective in clearing microfilariae in onchocerciasis patients with persistent microfilaridermia and in enhanced killing of adult worms after repeated standard IVM treatment. Background. Ivermectin (IVM) has been the drug of choice for the treatment of onchocerciasis. However, there have been reports of persistent microfilaridermia in individuals from an endemic area in Ghana after many rounds of IVM, raising concerns of suboptimal response or even the emergence of drug resistance. Because it is considered risky to continue relying only on IVM to combat this phenomenon, we assessed the effect of targeting the Onchocerca volvulus Wolbachia endosymbionts with doxycycline for these individuals with suboptimal response. Methods. One hundred sixty-seven patients, most of them with multiple rounds of IVM, were recruited in areas with IVM suboptimal response and treated with 100 mg/day doxycycline for 6 weeks. Three and 12 months after doxycycline treatment, patients took part in standard IVM treatment. Results. At 20 months after treatment, 80% of living female worms from the placebo group were Wolbachia positive, whereas only 5.1% in the doxycycline-treated group contained bacteria. Consistent with interruption of embryogenesis, none of the nodules removed from doxycycline-treated patients contained microfilariae, and 97% of those patients were without microfilaridermia, in contrast to placebo patients who remained at pretreatment levels ( P < .001). Moreover, a significantly enhanced number of dead worms were observed after doxycycline. Conclusions. Targeting the Wolbachia in O. volvulus is effective in clearing microfilariae in the skin of onchocerciasis patients with persistent microfilaridermia and in enhanced killing of adult worms after repeated standard IVM treatment. Strategies can now be developed that include doxycycline to control onchocerciasis in areas where infections persist despite the frequent use of IVM. Clinical Trials Registration.

With the increasing incidence of both obesity and thyroid cancer, we designed the present study to investigate a causal relationship between leptin, which is one of the well known adipokines, and well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC). Methods Serum leptin levels were measured in 30 patients with WDTC and compared to 30 healthy control subjects before and 1¬†month after surgery. Other parameters studied included age, sex, body mass index, menopausal status in women, lymph node status, tumor size, and disease multifocality.

0.591746658,26029632,Comparative metal oxide nanoparticle toxicity using embryonic zebrafish,"Engineered metal oxide nanoparticles (MO NPs) are finding increasing utility in the medical field as anticancer agents. Before validation of in vivo anticancer efficacy can occur, a better understanding of whole-animal toxicity is required. We compared the toxicity of seven widely used semiconductor MO NPs made from zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium dioxide, cerium dioxide and tin dioxide prepared in pure water and in synthetic seawater using a five-day embryonic zebrafish assay. We hypothesized that the toxicity of these engineered MO NPs would depend on physicochemical properties. Significant agglomeration of MO NPs in aqueous solutions is common making it challenging to associate NP characteristics such as size and charge with toxicity. However, data from our agglomerated MO NPs suggests that the elemental composition and dissolution potential are major drivers of toxicity. Only ZnO caused significant adverse effects of all MO particles tested, and only when prepared in pure water (point estimate median lethal concentration¬†=¬†3.5‚Äì9.1¬†mg/L). This toxicity was life stage dependent. The 24¬†h toxicity increased greatly (‚àº22.7 fold) when zebrafish exposures started at the larval life stage compared to the 24¬†h toxicity following embryonic exposure. Investigation into whether dissolution could account for ZnO toxicity revealed high levels of zinc ion (40‚Äì89% of total sample) were generated.

0.758431045,27427455,"The perfect storm: incarceration and the high-risk environment perpetuating transmission of HIV, hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis in Eastern Europe and Central Asia"," Despite global reductions in HIV incidence and mortality, the 15 UNAIDS-designated countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) that gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 constitute the only region where both continue to rise. HIV transmission in EECA is fuelled primarily by injection of opioids, with harsh criminalisation of drug use that has resulted in extraordinarily high levels of incarceration. Consequently, people who inject drugs, including those with HIV, hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis, are concentrated within prisons. Evidence-based primary and secondary prevention of HIV using opioid agonist therapies such as methadone and buprenorphine is available in prisons in only a handful of EECA countries (methadone or buprenorphine in five countries and needle and syringe programmes in three countries), with none of them meeting recommended coverage levels. Similarly, antiretroviral therapy coverage, especially among people who inject drugs, is markedly under-scaled. Russia completely bans opioid agonist therapies and does not support needle and syringe programmes‚Äîwith neither available in prisons‚Äîdespite the country‚Äôs high incarceration rate and having the largest burden of people with HIV who inject drugs in the region. Mathematical modelling for Ukraine suggests that high levels of incarceration in EECA countries facilitate HIV transmission among people who inject drugs, with 28‚Äì55% of all new HIV infections over the next 15 years predicted to be attributable to heightened HIV transmission risk among currently or previously incarcerated people who inject drugs. Scaling up of opioid agonist therapies within prisons and maintaining treatment after release would yield the greatest HIV transmission reduction in people who inject drugs. Additional analyses also suggest that at least 6% of all incident tuberculosis cases, and 75% of incident tuberculosis cases in people who inject drugs are due to incarceration. Interventions that reduce incarceration itself and effectively intervene with prisoners to screen, diagnose, and treat addiction and HIV, hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis are urgently needed to stem the multiple overlapping epidemics concentrated in prisons.

Design and setting  Prospective observational study in a tertiary care children‚Äôs hospital.    Patients and participants  63 children with confirmed meningococcal disease.    Interventions  Plasma concentrations of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF) were assayed on admission. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis was used to determine optimum thresholds for IL-1Ra:TNF, IL-1Ra:IL-6 and IL-1Ra:IL-8 ratios.    Measurements and results  Median IL-1Ra:TNF and IL-1Ra:IL-6 ratios were significantly higher in severe disease with septic shock than in severe disease without septic shock and in non severe disease (IL-1Ra:TNF 263 vs. 185 vs. 108; IL-1Ra:IL-6 139 vs. 23 vs. 17). Median IL-1Ra:IL-8 ratios were not significantly different in the three groups.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of the herbal formula Gamisoyo-San (GSS) on the muscles of hSOD1 G93A transgenic mice, a mouse model of ALS, by examining the tissue expression of inflammation- and oxidative stress-related proteins. The mice were randomly divided into three groups: nontransgenic mice (non-Tg, n = 4), hSOD1 G93A transgenic mice (Tg, n = 4), and GSS-treated hSOD1 G93A transgenic mice (Tg+GSS, n = 4).

Gastrocnemius (GA) tissues were analyzed for inflammatory proteins [CD11b and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)] and oxidative stress-related proteins [heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) and ferritin] by western blot analysis. Administration of GSS significantly reduced the level of inflammation- and oxidative stress-related proteins in hSOD1 G93A transgenic mice. GSS ameliorated inflammation by downregulating TLR4 and CD11b expression and regulated iron homeostasis in the GA muscle of hSOD1 G93A mice.

This analysis explored trial duration with first episode patients and whether early limited improvement predicts ultimate lack of treatment response with first episode patients as it does with multi-episode patients.    Methods  112 subjects (mean age=23.3 years [SD=5.1]) who presented between November 1998 and October 2004 with a first episode of psychosis and had a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorder, were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine or risperidone for 16 weeks. Treatment response, the primary outcome measure, was defined as a rating of mild or better on all of the positive symptom items on the SADS-C + PD. Response rates were calculated for each study week. A logistic regression analysis examined the association between percent reduction in symptom severity scores from baseline values at weeks 2, 4 or 8 and response by week 16.    Results  The estimated cumulative response rate by week 8 was 39.59% (95% CI: 29.77% ‚Äì 49.41%) and 65.19% (95% CI: 55.11% ‚Äì 75.27%) by week 16. The confidence intervals for estimated response at weeks 10, 12, 14 and 16 were not distinct. Response rates increased approximately 5 to 6 percentage points each 2 week interval between week 10 and 16. Percent reduction in symptom severity score at week 4 (but not 2 or 8) was associated (Chi-square = 3.96; df = 1, p<0.05) with responder status at week 16 (odds ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00;1.05). However, receiver operating characteristic curves did not suggest any level of percent symptom reduction that would be clinically useful as a predictor of response by week 16.    Conclusions  Many first episode patients respond between weeks 8 and 16 of treatment with a single antipsychotic medication. Limited early symptom improvement does not identify with enough accuracy to be clinically useful those first episode patients who will not improve with a full 16 week trial.

0.201097358,22021736,Inter-examiner reproducibility of clinical tests and criteria used to identify subacromial impingement syndrome,"Introduction A specific algorithm has been proposed for classifying impingement related shoulder pain in athletes with overhead activity. Data on the inter-examiner reproducibility of the suggested clinical tests and criteria and their mutual dependencies for identifying subacromial impingement symptoms (SIS) are not available. Objective To test the inter-examiner reproducibility of selected tests and criteria suggested for classifying SIS and the mutual dependencies of each of the individual tests and SIS. Method A standardised three-phase protocol for clinical reproducibility studies was followed, consisting of a training, an overall agreement and a study phase. To proceed to the study phase, an overall agreement of 0.80 was required. In total 10, 20 and 44 subjects were included in the three phases, respectively. The case prevalence in the study phase was 50%. The inclusion criterion for cases was ‚â•3, and for controls ‚â§1 positive test out of four. Cohen's Œ∫ statistics were used for calculating agreement. Results In the overall agreement phase, an agreement of 0.90 was obtained, while in the study phase it was 0.98 with a Œ∫ of 0.95 for SIS. Œ∫ Values for the individual tests varied between 0.60 and 0.95. Mutual dependencies between each test and SIS showed Neer's test with anterior pain to be most often used to determine SIS. Conclusions Inter-examiner reproducibility was moderate to almost perfect for the selected tests and criteria for SIS. The next challenge will be to establish reproducibility in clinical practice, as well as the validity of the tests and criteria for SIS. Article summary Article focus This study examines the inter-tester reproducibility of Hawkins', Neer's, Jobe's and Apprehension tests, included in a recent clinical reasoning algorithm, both as individual tests and as performed as a battery of tests for screening for subacromial impingement symptoms (SIS) in overhead athletes. Furthermore, the mutual dependency of each individual test and SIS was determined. Key messages Overall, the reproducibility was almost perfect for tests and criteria for SIS when following a standardised test protocol for reliability and validity studies. Mutual dependency was highest for Neer's test with anterior pain and SIS, implying that this was the test most often used to determine SIS. Strengths and limitations of this study The strength of the study is the strict adherence to a standardised study protocol for reproducibility and validity studies, with a training and an overall agreement phase, including the requirement of a 0.50 prevalence of SIS, before performing the study phase. Since the study population consisted of overhead athletes, for whom the algorithm is intended, data can be generalised to the target population. The limitation of the study is that the current mutual dependencies may have been deceptively high because of a possible bias due to the inclusion criteria used in this algorithm, since subjects with two out of four positive test responses are not included. However, this limitation has not biased the high reproducibility of the tests and criteria for SIS.",BMJ open,CLINIC

To address this problem, we introduce a shape representation enhancement over popular snake models in the context of confident scale-space such that a higher level of interpretation can hopefully be achieved. Our proposed system consists of a hierarchical analytic framework including feedback loops, self-adaptive and demand-adaptive adjustment, incorporating a steerable boundary detail term constraint based on multiscale B-spline interpolation. To minimize the noise interference inherited from microscopy acquisition, the coarse boundary derived from the initial segmentation with refined watershed line is coupled with microscopy compensation using the mean shift filtering. A progressive approximation is applied to achieve represented as a balance between a relief function of watershed algorithm and local minima concerning multi-scale optimality, convergence, and robust constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method overcomes problems with spurious branches, arbitrary gaps, low contrast boundaries and low signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed system has the potential to serve as an automated data processing tool for cell migration applications. ",Journal of microscopy,CS

0.01821546,13129848,Slb/Wnt11 controls hypoblast cell migration and morphogenesis at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation," Summary  During vertebrate gastrulation, highly coordinated cellular rearrangements lead to the formation of the three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In zebrafish, silberblick ( slb ) /wnt11 regulates normal gastrulation movements by activating a signalling pathway similar to the Frizzled-signalling pathway, which establishes epithelial planar cell polarity (PCP) in Drosophila . However, the cellular mechanisms by which slb/wnt11 functions during zebrafish gastrulation are still unclear. Using high-resolution two-photon confocal imaging followed by computer-assisted reconstruction and motion analysis, we have analysed the movement and morphology of individual cells in three dimensions during the course of gastrulation. We show that in slb -mutant embryos, hypoblast cells within the forming germ ring have slower, less directed migratory movements at the onset of gastrulation. These aberrant cell movements are accompanied by defects in the orientation of cellular processes along the individual movement directions of these cells. We conclude that slb/wnt11 -mediated orientation of cellular processes plays a role in facilitating and stabilising movements of hypoblast cells in the germ ring, thereby pointing at a novel function of the slb/wnt11 signalling pathway for the regulation of migratory cell movements at early stages of gastrulation.

METHODS This was a single-center, retrospective observational cohort study conducted between January 2013 and April 2015. All patients who had either a primary transtibial amputation (TTA) or transfemoral amputation (TFA) conducted at our institution during the study period were assessed for inclusion. All TTA patients underwent a standardized one-stage operative procedure (ad modum Persson amputation) performed approximately 10 cm below the knee joint. All TTA procedures were performed with sagittal flaps. TFA procedures were performed in one stage with amputation approximately 10 cm above the knee joint, performed with anterior/posterior flaps. Trained residents or senior consultants performed the surgical procedures. The SAS is based on intraoperative heart rate, blood pressure and blood loss. Intraoperative parameters of interest were collected by revising electronic health records. The first author of this study calculated the SAS. Data regarding major complications were not revealed to the author until after the calculation of SAS. The SAS results were arranged into four groups (SAS 0-4, SAS 5-6, SAS 7-8 and SAS 9-10). The cohort was then divided into two groups representing low-risk (SAS ‚â• 7) and high-risk patients (SAS < 7) using a previously established threshold. The outcome of interest was the occurrence of major complications and death within 30-d of surgery. RESULTS A logistic regression model with SAS 9-10 as a reference showed a significant linear association between lower SAS and more postoperative complications [all patients: OR = 2.00 (1.33-3.03), P = 0.001]. This effect was pronounced for TFA [OR = 2.61 (1.52-4.47), P < 0.001]. A significant increase was observed for the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group for all patients [OR = 2.80 (1.40-5.61), P = 0.004] and for the TFA sub-group [OR = 3.82 (1.5-9.42), P = 0.004]. The AUC from the models were estimated as follows: All patients = [0.648 (0.562-0.733), P = 0.001], for TFA patients = [0.710 (0.606-0.813), P < 0.001] and for TTA patients = [0.472 (0.383-0.672), P = 0.528]. This indicates moderate discriminatory power of the SAS in predicting postoperative complications among TFA patients. CONCLUSION SAS provides information regarding the potential development of complications following TFA. The SAS is especially useful when patients are divided into high- and low-risk groups.",World journal of orthopedics,CLINIC
0.673435348,29730037,Parental hormones are associated with crop loss and family sickness following catastrophic flooding in lowland Bolivia," The physiology of fatherhood is a growing field of study, and variability in hormonal mediators of reproductive effort (e.g. testosterone, cortisol) can predict variability in paternal investment. Studies often find that lower testosterone levels are associated with increased paternal investment, though most studies are conducted under relatively stable ecological conditions. In this paper, we examine parental physiological correlates of crop loss and family health problems among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists following a catastrophic flood in lowland Bolivia. Immediately after a devastating 2014 flood that impacted >75% of Tsimane communities, we conducted structured interviews examining crop losses and morbidity, and collected saliva specimens from 421 parents (n= 292 households) to analyze cortisol and testosterone. Over 98% of interviewees reported horticultural losses, with the average family losing 88% of their crops, while 80% of families reported flood-induced injuries or illnesses. Controlling for age, body mass index, and time of specimen collection, men‚Äôs testosterone was negatively associated with both absolute cropland losses (Std. Œ≤= ‚àí0.16, p=0.037), and percent of cropland lost (Std. Œ≤= ‚àí0.16, p=0.040). Female testosterone was not associated with crop losses.

0.392873312,26280391,Principles of protein targeting to the nucleolus,"The nucleolus is the hallmark of nuclear compartmentalization and has been shown to exert multiple roles in cellular metabolism besides its main function as the place of rRNA synthesis and assembly of ribosomes. Nucleolar proteins dynamically localize and accumulate in this nuclear compartment relative to the surrounding nucleoplasm. In this study, we have assessed the molecular requirements that are necessary and sufficient for the localization and accumulation of peptides and proteins inside the nucleoli of living cells. The data showed that positively charged peptide entities composed of arginines alone and with an isoelectric point at and above 12.6 are necessary and sufficient for mediating significant nucleolar accumulation. A threshold of 6 arginines is necessary for peptides to accumulate in nucleoli, but already 4 arginines are sufficient when fused within 15 amino acid residues of a nuclear localization signal of a protein. Using a pH sensitive dye, we found that the nucleolar compartment is particularly acidic when compared to the surrounding nucleoplasm and, hence, provides the ideal electrochemical environment to bind poly-arginine containing proteins. In fact, we found that oligo-arginine peptides and GFP fusions bind RNA in vitro . Consistent with RNA being the main binding partner for arginines in the nucleolus, we found that the same principles apply to cells from insects to man, indicating that this mechanism is highly conserved throughout evolution.","Nucleus (Austin, Tex.)",BIOCHEM

H 2 O 2 can react with free iron to form the hydroxyl radical, through Fenton Chemistry. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine if there was a role for the hydroxyl radical in neonatal HI brain injury and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our data demonstrate that HI increases the deposition of free iron and hydroxyl radical formation, in both P7 hippocampal slice cultures exposed to oxygen‚Äìglucose deprivation (OGD), and the neonatal rat exposed to HI. Both these processes were found to be nitric oxide (NO) dependent. Further analysis demonstrated that the NO-dependent increase in iron deposition was mediated through increased transferrin receptor expression and a decrease in ferritin expression. This was correlated with a reduction in aconitase activity. Both NO inhibition and iron scavenging, using deferoxamine administration, reduced hydroxyl radical levels and neuronal cell death. In conclusion, our results suggest that increased NO generation leads to neuronal cell death during neonatal HI, at least in part, by altering iron homeostasis and hydroxyl radical generation. Graphical abstract Highlights ‚Ä¢ HI increases the deposition of free iron and hydroxyl radical formation in the neonatal brain. ‚Ä¢ Both these processes are NO dependent. ‚Ä¢ Increased iron deposition is mediated via increased TfR and decreased ferritin expression. ‚Ä¢ These processes are involved in the neuronal cell death associated with neonatal HI.",Redox biology,BIOCHEM
0.144456459,26370359,Saccadic modulation of stimulus processing in primary visual cortex,"Saccadic eye movements play a central role in primate vision. Yet, relatively little is known about their effects on the neural processing of visual inputs. Here we examine this question in primary visual cortex (V1) using receptive-field-based models, combined with an experimental design that leaves the retinal stimulus unaffected by saccades. This approach allows us to analyse V1 stimulus processing during saccades with unprecedented detail, revealing robust perisaccadic modulation. In particular, saccades produce biphasic firing rate changes that are composed of divisive gain suppression followed by an additive rate increase. Microsaccades produce similar, though smaller, modulations. We furthermore demonstrate that this modulation is likely inherited from the LGN, and is driven largely by extra-retinal signals. These results establish a foundation for integrating saccades into existing models of visual cortical stimulus processing, and highlight the importance of studying visual neuron function in the context of eye movements.  Primates acquire visual information through rapid saccadic eye movements, although little is known about their effects on neural processing of visual inputs. Here the authors demonstrate that saccades produce modulations of visual cortical processing that likely originate in the thalamus.",Nature communications,NEURO

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which consists of a catalytic C, a structural A, and a regulatory B subunit, plays diverse roles in Wnt signaling through its B56 subunits. B56 is a multigene family encoding for proteins with a conserved core domain and divergent amino- and carboxy-termini. Ectopic B56Œ± and B56Œ≥ reduce Œ≤-catenin abundance and B56Œ± reduces Wnt-dependent transcription, suggesting that B56Œ± and B56Œ≥ inhibit Wnt signaling. In contrast, B56Œµ is required for Wnt signaling. Knowledge of where and when B56 subunits are expressed during Xenopus development will aid in our understanding of their roles in Wnt signaling. Results We have undertaken expression analyses of B56Œ± and B56Œ≥ in Xenopus laevis . We cloned Xenopus B56Œ±; it is 88% identical to human B56Œ±. Xenopus B56Œ≥ is 94% identical with human B56Œ≥, however, a novel evolutionarily conserved mixed-isoform transcript was identified that contains a B56Œ¥-like amino-terminal domain and a B56Œ≥ core domain. The B56Œ¥-like variable domain exon is located upstream of the B56Œ≥ variable domain exon at the human B56Œ≥ locus, suggesting that the mixed-isoform transcript is due to alternative splicing. B56Œ≥ transcripts with different 3' ends were identified that lack or possess a 35 base pair sequence, resulting in either a transcript similar to human B56Œ≥1, or an uncharacterized evolutionarily conserved sequence. Real time RT-PCR analyses revealed that B56Œ± is expressed at moderate levels before the midblastula transition (MBT), at reduced levels during gastrulation and neurulation, and at high levels during organogenesis, while B56Œ≥ is expressed at low levels until organogenesis. B56Œ± is enriched in the ventral hemisphere pre-MBT, while B56Œ≥ is ventrally enriched post-MBT. AŒ±, AŒ≤, CŒ± and CŒ≤ are expressed in early Xenopus development, suggesting the presence of a functional heterotrimer. Conclusion Our data suggest that B56 functional diversity is achieved in part through the synthesis of a novel mixed-isoform B56Œ¥/Œ≥ transcript. Our data also suggest that B56Œ± functions pre-MBT, inhibiting Wnt signaling on the ventral side of the embryo, and again during organogenesis, while B56Œ≥ functions primarily post-MBT.",BMC developmental biology,BIOCHEM
0.596842519,20430759,Selective Visualization of Cyclooxygenase-2 in Inflammation and Cancer by Targeted Fluorescent Imaging Agents ‚Ä†," Effective diagnosis of inflammation and cancer by molecular imaging is challenging because of interference from non-selective accumulation of the contrast agents in normal tissues. Here we report a series of novel fluorescence imaging agents that efficiently target cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is normally absent from cells, but is found at high levels in inflammatory lesions, and in many premalignant and malignant tumors. After either intraperitoneal or intravenous injection, these reagents become highly enriched in inflamed or tumor tissue compared to normal tissue and this accumulation provides sufficient signal for in vivo fluorescence imaging. Further, we show that only the intact parent compound is found in the region of interest. COX-2-specific delivery was unambiguously confirmed using animals bearing targeted deletions of COX-2 and by blocking the COX-2 active site with high affinity inhibitors in both in vitro and in vivo models. Because of their high specificity, contrast, and detectability, these COX-2 beacons are ideal candidates for detection of inflammatory lesions or early-stage COX-2-expressing human cancers, such as those in the esophagus, oropharynx, and colon.

0.081574712,27653698,RNF4-Dependent Oncogene Activation by Protein Stabilization,"SUMMARY Ubiquitylation regulates signaling pathways critical for cancer development and, in many cases, targets proteins for degradation. Here, we report that ubiquitylation by RNF4 stabilizes otherwise short-lived oncogenic transcription factors, including Œ≤-catenin, Myc, c-Jun, and the Notch intracellular-domain (N-ICD) protein. RNF4 enhances the transcriptional activity of these factors, as well as Wnt- and Notch-dependent gene expression. While RNF4 is a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase, protein stabilization requires the substrate‚Äôs phosphorylation, rather than SUMOylation, and binding to RNF4‚Äôs arginine-rich motif domain. Stabilization also involves generation of unusual polyubiquitin chains and docking of RNF4 to chromatin. Biologically, RNF4 enhances the tumor phenotype and is essential for cancer cell survival. High levels of RNF4 mRNA correlate with poor survival of a subgroup of breast cancer patients, and RNF4 protein levels are elevated in 30% of human colon adenocarcinomas. Thus, RNF4-dependent ubiquitylation translates transient phosphorylation signal(s) into long-term protein stabilization, resulting in enhanced oncoprotein activation.

0.613766007,26613416,Stable G protein-effector complexes in striatal neurons: mechanism of assembly and role in neurotransmitter signaling,"In the striatum, signaling via G protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors is essential for motor control. Critical to this process is the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) that produces second messenger cAMP upon receptor-mediated activation by G protein Golf. However, the molecular organization of the G olf- AC5 signaling axis is not well understood. In this study, we report that in the striatum AC5 exists in a stable pre-coupled complex with subunits of G olf heterotrimer. We use genetic mouse models with disruption in individual components of the complex to reveal hierarchical order of interactions required for AC5-G olf stability. We further identify that the assembly of AC5-G olf complex is mediated by PhLP1 chaperone that plays central role in neurotransmitter receptor coupling to cAMP production motor learning. These findings provide evidence for the existence of stable G protein-effector signaling complexes and identify a new component essential for their assembly. DOI:  http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10451.001 eLife digest In the brain, cells called neurons communicate with one another using chemicals called neurotransmitters, which bind to receptors on the surface of cells. In most cases, the binding of neurotransmitter causes a protein known as a G protein to interact with the receptor. G proteins are made up of three subunits: Œ±, Œ≤ and Œ≥. After binding to the receptor, the Œ± subunit separates from the Œ≤/Œ≥ subunits ‚Äì which remain together ‚Äì and both components then act as signals to activate specific targets in the cell. There are many different Œ±, Œ≤ and Œ≥ subunits, which participate in various signaling pathways in different parts of the brain. In the striatum ‚Äì a region involved in controlling movement ‚Äì a particular combination of Œ±, Œ≤ and Œ≥ subunits called G olf is responsible for activating an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5). Traditionally, G protein signalling has been thought to occur in stages so that the binding of neurotransmitter to receptors on striatal neurons would lead to the dissociation of G olf into the Œ± and Œ≤Œ≥ subunits. Then the Œ± and Œ≤Œ≥ subunits are thought to bind to and activate AC5. However, Xie et al. now show that all three subunits of G olf are already found in a stable group (or complex) with AC5 in striatal neurons. Neurotransmitter binding to the receptors causes the entire G olf -AC5complex to rearrange and this process activates AC5. A particular chaperone protein regulates the assembly of the G protein-AC5complex. Mice that lack the gene that encodes this chaperone in striatal neurons struggle to learn how to balance on a rotating rod. In humans, mutations in the genes that encode G olf and AC5 cause dystonia, which is a disorder characterised by involuntary movements. Given the evidence linking this chaperone protein to the regulation of G olf -AC5 signaling, future experiments should investigate whether it might also contribute to dystonia.

0.783781881,15728257,Golgi polarization in a strong electric field," Directional cell migration requires proper cell polarization. The redistribution of the Golgi apparatus is an important event in the polarization and migration of many types of cells, as a polarized Golgi supplies membrane components for leading edge protrusion. Direct current electric fields induce directional cell migration in a wide variety of cells. Here we show that electric fields of 300 mV/mm induce robust Golgi polarization and directional cell migration in CHO cells. Asymmetric Src and PI 3-kinase signalling as well as actin polymerization are essential for electric field-induced Golgi polarization and directional cell migration. The Golgi polarizes at the same time as cells change morphology and migrate directionally in response to an electric field. Golgi polarization in turn significantly reinforces and maintains optimal electrotaxis. It is not known whether electrical signals, when contradicting other directional cues, are still able to polarize cells and direct cell migration. Most strikingly, Golgi polarization and cell migration simply follow the direction of an applied electric field and ignore all other cues generated by wounding a monolayer of CHO cells. Thus, an electric field of 300 mV/mm is the predominant cue to polarize the Golgi and direct cell migration mediated by PI 3-kinase and Src signalling. ",Journal of cell science,BIOCHEM

Using immunohistochemistry to assess translocation of Œ≤-catenin protein, we identified intranuclear staining, which suggest WNT pathway activation, in 8 of 43 (19%) adult and 9 of 30 (30%) pediatric glioblastoma patient surgical samples. WNT activity, evidenced by nuclear Œ≤-catenin in our cohort and high expression of its target AXIN2 in published glioma datasets, was associated with shorter patient survival, although this was not statistically significant. We determined the effects of the porcupine inhibitor LGK974 in 3 glioblastoma cell lines with elevated AXIN2 and found that it reduced WNT pathway activity by 50% or more as assessed by T cell factor-luciferase reporters. WNT inhibition led to suppression of growth and proliferation in the cultures and a modest induction of cell death. LGK974 reduced NANOG mRNA levels and the fraction of cells expressing the stem cell marker CD133 in neurosphere cultures, induced glial differentiation, and suppressed clonogenicity. These data indicate that LGK974 represents a promising new agent that can inhibit the canonical WNT pathway in vitro, slow tumor growth and deplete stem-like clonogenic cells, thereby providing further support for targeting WNT in patients with glioblastoma.

However, most approaches for identifying cancer mutations focus on either the entire-gene or single amino-acid level. We have bridged these two methodologies with a multiscale mutation clustering algorithm that identifies variable length mutation clusters in cancer genes. We ran our algorithm on 539 genes using the combined mutation data in 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified 1295 mutation clusters. The resulting mutation clusters cover a wide range of scales and often overlap with many kinds of protein features including structured domains, phosphorylation sites, and known single nucleotide variants. We statistically associated these multiscale clusters with gene expression and drug response data to illuminate the functional and clinical consequences of mutations in our clusters. Interestingly, we find multiple clusters within individual genes that have differential functional associations: these include PTEN , FUBP1 , and CDH1 . This methodology has potential implications in identifying protein regions for drug targets, understanding the biological underpinnings of cancer, and personalizing cancer treatments. Toward this end, we have made the mutation clusters and the clustering algorithm available to the public. Clusters and pathway associations can be interactively browsed at m2c.systemsbiology.net .

Machine learning methods have been widely applied for timely predicting resistance of MTB given a specific drug and identifying resistance markers. However, they have been not validated on a large cohort of MTB samples from multi-centers across the world in terms of resistance prediction and resistance marker identification. Several machine learning classifiers and linear dimension reduction techniques were developed and compared for a cohort of 13 402 isolates collected from 16 countries across 6 continents and tested 11 drugs. Results Compared to conventional molecular diagnostic test, area under curve of the best machine learning classifier increased for all drugs especially by 23.11%, 15.22% and 10.14% for pyrazinamide, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively ( P <‚Äâ0.01).

0.675061263,30102395,A Freeloader? The Highly Eroded Yet Large Genome of the  Serratia symbiotica  Symbiont of  Cinara strobi,"Abstract Genome reduction is pervasive among maternally inherited bacterial endosymbionts. This genome reduction can eventually lead to serious deterioration of essential metabolic pathways, thus rendering an obligate endosymbiont unable to provide essential nutrients to its host. This loss of essential pathways can lead to either symbiont complementation (sharing of the nutrient production with a novel co-obligate symbiont) or symbiont replacement (complete takeover of nutrient production by the novel symbiont). However, the process by which these two evolutionary events happen remains somewhat enigmatic by the lack of examples of intermediate stages of this process. Cinara aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) typically harbor two obligate bacterial symbionts: Buchnera and Serratia symbiotica . However, the latter has been replaced by different bacterial taxa in specific lineages, and thus species within this aphid lineage could provide important clues into the process of symbiont replacement. In the present study, using 16S rRNA high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we determined that the aphid Cinara strobi harbors not two, but three fixed bacterial symbionts: Buchnera aphidicola , a Sodalis sp., and S. symbiotica . Through genome assembly and genome-based metabolic inference, we have found that only the first two symbionts ( Buchnera and Sodalis ) actually contribute to the hosts‚Äô supply of essential nutrients while S. symbiotica has become unable to contribute towards this task. We found that S. symbiotica has a rather large and highly eroded genome which codes only for a few proteins and displays extensive pseudogenization. Thus, we propose an ongoing symbiont replacement within C. strobi , in which a once ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù S. symbiotica does no longer contribute towards the beneficial association. These results suggest that in dual symbiotic systems, when a substitute cosymbiont is available, genome deterioration can precede genome reduction and a symbiont can be maintained despite the apparent lack of benefit to its host.",Genome biology and evolution,ANIMAL

Recent work suggests that biotic interactions among plants and between plants and soil organisms drive key aspects of resource use complementarity. Here, we provide a conceptual framework for integrating positive biotic interactions across guilds of organisms, more specifically between plants and mycorrhizal types, to explain resource use complementarity in plants and its consequences for plant competition. Our overarching hypothesis is that ecosystem functioning increases when more plant species associate with functionally dissimilar mycorrhizal fungi because differing mycorrhizal types will increase coverage of habitat space for and reduce competition among plants. We introduce a recently established field experiment (MyDiv) that uses different pools of tree species that associate with either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi to create orthogonal experimental gradients in tree species richness and mycorrhizal associations and present initial results. Finally, we discuss options for future mechanistic studies on resource use complementarity within MyDiv.

In recent years, this phenomenon has taken on new dimensions in Iran and has changed from a local problem to a national issue. This study is an attempt to investigate the formation of the dust storms crossing the Western Iran. Methodology To find the sources of the dust storms entering Iran, first we examine three determined dust paths in the region and their temporal activities, using MODIS satellite images. Then, four regions were identified as dust sources through soil, land cover and wind data. Finally, atmospheric analyses are implemented to find synoptic patterns inducing dust storms.

Finally source 3 is bounded in eastern and south-eastern deserts of Saudi Arabia called Rub-Al-Khali desert, or Empty Quarter. Moreover, south-eastern part of Iraq (source 4) was also determined as a secondary source which thickens the dust masses originating from the above mentioned sources. The study of synoptic circulations suggests that the dust storms originating from source 1 are formed due to the intense pressure gradient between the low-pressure system of Zagros and a high-pressure cell formed on Mediterranean Sea.

0.228544608,19503750,Directed Interactions Between Auditory and Superior Temporal Cortices and their Role in Sensory Integration,"Recent studies using functional imaging and electrophysiology demonstrate that processes related to sensory integration are not restricted to higher association cortices but already occur in early sensory cortices, such as primary auditory cortex. While anatomical studies suggest the superior temporal sulcus (STS) as likely source of visual input to auditory cortex, little evidence exists to support this notion at the functional level. Here we tested this hypothesis by simultaneously recording from sites in auditory cortex and STS in alert animals stimulated with dynamic naturalistic audio‚Äìvisual scenes. Using Granger causality and directed transfer functions we first quantified causal interactions at the level of field potentials, and subsequently determined those frequency bands that show effective interactions, i.e. interactions that are relevant for influencing neuronal firing at the target site. We found that effective interactions from auditory cortex to STS prevail below 20 Hz, while interactions from STS to auditory cortex prevail above 20 Hz. In addition, we found that directed interactions from STS to auditory cortex make a significant contribution to multisensory influences in auditory cortex: Sites in auditory cortex showing multisensory enhancement received stronger feed-back from STS during audio‚Äìvisual than during auditory stimulation, while sites with multisensory suppression received weaker feed-back. These findings suggest that beta frequencies might be important for inter-areal coupling in the temporal lobe and demonstrate that superior temporal regions indeed provide one major source of visual influences to auditory cortex.",Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,NEURO
0.848774019,14697001,Exchange of Disfluency With Age From Function Words to Content Words in Spanish Speakers Who Stutter," The main purpose of the present study was to examine whether the developmental change in loci of disfluency from mainly function words to mainly content words, observed for English speakers who stutter ( P. Howell, J. Au-Yeung, & S. Sackin, 1999 ), also occurs for comparable Spanish speakers who stutter. The participants were divided into 5 age groups. There were 7 participants in Group 1, from 3 to 5 years old; 11 in Group 2, from 6 to 9 years old; 10 in Group 3, from 10 to 11 years old; 9 in Group 4, from 12 to 16 years old; and 9 in Group 5, from 20 to 68 years old. Across all groups, 36 of the 46 participants were male. The study method involved segmenting speech into phonological words (PWs) that consist of an obligatory content word with optional function words that precede and follow it. The initial function words in the PWs were examined to establish whether they have a higher disfluency rate than the final ones ( J. Au-Yeung, P. Howell, & L. Pilgrim, 1998 ). Disfluency on function words in a PW was higher when the word occurred before a content word rather than after a content word for all age groups. Disfluencies on function and content words were then examined to determine whether they change over age groups in the same way as for English speakers who stutter ( Howell et al., 1999 ). The rate of disfluency on function words was higher than that on content words, particularly in the youngest speakers. Function word disfluency rate dropped off and content word disfluency rate increased across age groups. These patterns are similar to those reported for English. Possible explanations for these similarities across the two languages are discussed. ","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",PSYCH
0.271769457,30258912,Analysis of EX5del4232ins268 and EX5del955  PAH  gene mutations in Ukrainian patients with phenylketonuria,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The major molecular defects causing PKU are missense mutations of PAH gene. Large deletions of exon 5 (EX5del955 and EX5del4232ins) were first reported by the Czech study and were later found also in the Polish, Slovak, Slovenian and Italian PKU-patients. These observations demonstrate the existence of a common subset of this mutation predominantly among Central European populations of Slavic descent. That is why we suggest that EX5del1955 and EX5del4232ins268 mutations might be frequent causes of PKU in Ukrainian patients. EX5del955 and EX5del4232ins268 mutations were analyzed in 106 unrelated PKU patients negative for PAH gene mutations on one or both alleles from our previous analysis. The simultaneous detection of EX5del4232ins268 and EX5del955 mutations was performed by PCR amplification of mutant alleles. EX5del955 mutation was not detected in the Ukrainian patients. This relative alleles frequency of EX5del4232ins268 mutation in the Ukrainian PKU population was determined as 1,66%. Our findings can be the one more evidence of Central European Slavic origin of EX5del4232ins268 mutation, suggested previously. This finding is important for the improvement of DNA diagnosis necessary for the management of PKU patients from Ukraine.",Genes & diseases,BIOCHEM

We evaluated Cystatin C (CysC) as an early biomarker of serum creatinine (SCr)-AKI and as an alternative to define AKI.    Methods  160 non-cardiac children admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) were prospectively studied. We measured daily CysC and SCr. AKI was staged according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) SCr criteria and by similarly applied criteria, using CysC (CysC-AKI) We calculated area under the curve (AUC) for 1) neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-18 (IL-18), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and urine cystatin C (uCysC) to diagnose SCr- and CysC-AKI and 2) for CysC to diagnose SCr-AKI. We evaluated the relation of each AKI definition with length of stay and mechanical ventilation duration.    Results  44% of patients developed SCr-AKI; 32% developed CysC-AKI. Whether AKI was defined by SCr or CysC, NGALwas associated with AKI severity. CysC-AKI was not more strongly associated with clinical outcomes. However, early ICU admission CysC predicted SCr-AKI development within 48 hours (AUC=0.70 [95% CI 0.53 ‚Äì 0.89]).    Conclusions  Our findings do not support replacing SCr by CysC to define AKI. However, CysC may be used for predicting AKI development when obtained early in ICU admission.  ","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",CLINIC

The embryos from five independent transgenic lines of Aedes aegypti , each with a single integrated non-autonomous piggyBac transposable element gene vector, were injected with plasmids containing the piggyBac transposase open-reading frame under the regulatory control of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp70 promoter. No evidence for somatic remobilization was detected in the subsequent adults whereas somatic remobilization was readily detected when similar lines of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster were injected with the same piggyBac transposase-expressing plasmid. Aedes aegypti heterozygotes of piggyBac reporter-containing transgenes and piggyBac transposase-expressing transgenes showed no evidence of somatic and germ-line remobilization based on phenotypic and molecular detection methods. The post-integration mobility properties of piggyBac in Aedes aegypti enhance the utility of this gene vector for certain applications, particularly those where any level of vector remobilization is unacceptable.

Methods A retrospective review of patients undergoing lumbar fusion was performed. For patients in whom fever (‚â•38.6¬∞C) was documented, charts were reviewed for any fever workup or diagnosis. Multivariate regression was used to identify independent risk factors for the development of postoperative fever. Results A total of 868 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 105 exhibited at least 1 episode of fever during hospitalization. The first documentation of fever occurred during the first 24 hours in 43.8% of cases, during postoperative hours 24‚Äì48 in 53.3%, and later than 48 hours postoperatively in 2.9%. At least 1 component of a fever workup was conducted in 47 of the 105 patients who had fever, resulting in fever-associated diagnoses in 4 patients prior to discharge. Three patients who had fever during the inpatient stay developed complications after discharge. On multivariate analysis, operations longer than 150 minutes (relative risk [RR], 1.66; p=0.015) and narcotic consumption greater than 85 oral morphine equivalents on postoperative day 0 (RR, 1.53; p=0.038) were independently associated with an increased risk of developing postoperative fever. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that inpatient fever occurred in roughly 1 in 8 patients following lumbar fusion surgery. In most cases where a fever workup was performed, no cause of fever was detected. Longer operative time and increased early postoperative narcotic use may increase the risk of developing postoperative fever.",Neurospine,CLINIC
0.981799565,23497491,"Ethnotaxonomical considerations and usage of ichthyofauna in a fishing community in Cear√° State, Northeast Brazil","Background Artisanal fishery is one of the most important economic activities for human populations living in coastal areas. The traditional knowledge that fishermen have of fishes is of utmost importance for the establishment of conservation strategies for many species. This study aimed to analyse the knowledge of and utilization of fishes by the artisanal fishermen in a fishing community on the coast of Cear√° State (Northeast Brazil). Methods In 2011, a number of semi-structured interviews were performed with fishermen with more than 20 years of fishery experience. The interviews were about fisheries (collecting spots, artefacts, etc.) and fish use. The fishes cited by the fishermen were identified scientifically and ethnotaxonomically. Results Considered masters of fishery, they cited 162 vernacular names of fishes, which corresponded to 290 different species, also including other animals such as dolphins, porpoises, whales and manatees. The criteria for the classification of the fishes were well known and utilised by the fishermen, and they were based on morphology, behaviour, habitat and the importance of commercial and fishing activities. Four hierarchical categories were identified in their classification system: kingdom, life-form, generic and specific. The fish nomenclature created by the fishermen was mostly composed of generic and monotypic names. The main uses of fish were for food and commercial purposes. Conclusions The results stress the richness and complexity of the knowledge of the artisanal fishermen of Redonda Beach, and they provide support for the possibility of future studies and for the development of management plans and the management of wildlife resources.",Journal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine,ECO
0.283427738,28424974,Transposable elements in the  Anopheles funestus  transcriptome," Transposable elements (TEs) are present in most of the eukaryotic genomes and their impact on genome evolution is increasingly recognized. Although there is extensive information on the TEs present in several eukaryotic genomes, less is known about the expression of these elements at the transcriptome level. Here we present a detailed analysis regarding the expression of TEs in A. funestus, the second most important vector of human malaria in Africa. Several transcriptionally active TE families belonging both to Class I and II were identified and characterized. Interestingly, we have identified a full-length putative active element (including the presence of full length TIRs in the genomic sequence) belonging to the hAT superfamily, which presents active members in other insect genomes. This work contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of transposable elements in A. funestus transcriptome. Our results reveal that TEs are abundant and diverse in the mosquito and that most of the TE families found in the genome are represented in the mosquito transcriptome, a fact that could indicate activity of these elements. The vast diversity of TEs expressed in A. funestus suggests that there is ongoing amplification of several families in this organism. ",Genetica,BIOCHEM

0.044686516,17154367,Contribution of VCAF-positive cells to neovascularization and calcification in atherosclerotic plaque development," Calcification of the vessel wall is a regulated process with many similarities to osteogenesis. Progenitor cells may play a role in this process. Previously, we identified a novel gene, Vascular Calcification Associated Factor ( VCAF ), which was shown to be important in pericyte osteogenic differentiation. The aim of this study was to determine the localization and expression pattern of VCAF in human cells and tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis of seven atherosclerotic arteries confirmed VCAF protein expression within calcified lesions. In addition, individual VCAF-positive cells were detected within the intima and adventitia in areas where sporadic 3G5-positive pericytes were localized. Furthermore, VCAF-positive cells were identified in newly formed microvessels in association with CD34-positive/CD146-positive/c-kit-positive cells as well as in intact CD31-positive endothelium in internal mammary arteries. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of VCAF (18 kD) in protein lysates extracted from human smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and osteoblasts. In fracture callus samples from three patients, VCAF was detected in osteoblasts and microvessels. This study demonstrates the presence of VCAF in neovessels and raises the possibility that VCAF could be a new marker for vascular progenitor cells involved in a number of differentiation pathways. These data may have implications for the prevention or treatment of vascular disease. ",The Journal of pathology,IMMUN
0.089263168,21815902,Plasma CNP Forms and Thyroid Status in Prepubertal Children with Acquired Thyroid Disease,"  Objective  C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and thyroid hormone (TH) are essential for normal skeletal growth. Plasma CNP peptides correlate with growth velocity, but the relationship between thyroid status and CNP production is unknown. This study examined the impact of restoring normal TH levels on CNP and height velocity (HV) in children with acquired hypo- and hyperthyroidism.    Design  We performed a prospective, observational study in prepubertal children with acquired hypothyroidism (n=15) and hyperthyroidism (n=12).    Measurements  Blood levels of CNP, amino-terminal proCNP (NTproCNP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), IGF-I, and TH levels were measured before and during the first six months of standard treatment for hypo- and hyperthyroidism, and correlations were determined.    Results  At baseline, HV, CNP, NTproCNP, and BSAP were significantly higher in hyper- than in hypothyroid subjects. Changes in TH after treatment were closely coupled to change in CNP and NTproCNP in hyper-, but not in hypothyroid children. In addition, a positive association of HV with CNP peptides was found during treatment of hyperthyroidism. Normalizing TH did not correlate with changes in BSAP or IGF-I in either group.    Conclusions  Plasma CNP peptides are higher in children with hyper- than in hypothyroidism at diagnosis, and, in hyperthyroid children, change concordantly with TH and HV during treatment. Differential responses of CNP in the two groups suggest CNP production is dependent on growth plate activity and not a direct effect of TH on CNP gene expression. Our findings suggest novel mechanisms underlying changes in skeletal response during treatment in children with acquired thyroid disease.  ",Clinical endocrinology,CLINIC
0.840609696,29334895,Challenges imposed by minor reference alleles on the identification and reporting of clinical variants from exome data,"Background The conventional variant calling of pathogenic alleles in exome and genome sequencing requires the presence of the non-pathogenic alleles as genome references. This hinders the correct identification of variants with minor and/or pathogenic reference alleles warranting additional approaches for variant calling. Results More than 26,000 Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) variants have a minor reference allele including variants with known ClinVar disease alleles. For instance, in a number of variants related to¬†clotting disorders, the phenotype-associated allele is a human genome reference allele (rs6025, rs6003, rs1799983, and rs2227564 using the assembly hg19). We highlighted how the current variant calling standards miss homozygous reference disease variants in these sites and provided a bioinformatic panel that can be used to screen these variants using commonly available variant callers. We present exome sequencing results from an individual with venous thrombosis to emphasize how pathogenic alleles in clinically relevant variants escape variant calling while non-pathogenic alleles are detected. Conclusions This article highlights the importance of specialized variant calling strategies in clinical variants with minor reference alleles especially in the context of personal genomes and exomes. We provide here a simple strategy to screen potential disease-causing variants when present in homozygous reference state.

0.669010508,30832640,Predictors of condom use behavior among men who have sex with men in China using a modified information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model,"Background Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in China. Correct and consistent condom use is one of the most effective strategies for preventing the spread of HIV. This study developed a modified Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model to predict condom use behavior among Chinese MSM. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data using self-administered electronic questionnaire. Participants were recruited from HIV Voluntary Counseling and Testing clinics in six district Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Guangzhou and two community-based HIV service centers (Lingnan Partners and Zhitong Charity) from May to September 2017. Structural equation modeling was performed to develop the modified IMB model with extended multilevel factors. Results Among the 976 MSM included, 52.05% had engaged in anal intercourse with a condom every time. The final modified IMB model fitted the data more ideally than the conventional model. The final modified IMB model revealed that behavioral skills positively contributed directly to condom use ( Œ≤ =‚Äâ0.385, p <‚Äâ0.001) and partially mediated the associations between information ( Œ≤ =‚Äâ0.106, p =‚Äâ0.005) and motivation ( Œ≤ =‚Äâ0.390, p <‚Äâ0.001) and condom use. Regarding the extended multilevel factors, education, income, receiving HIV prevention services, sexual partner seeking behavior, depression, intimate partner violence, and child sexual abuse had indirect impacts on condom use that were mediated by information, motivation, and/or behavioral skills ( p <‚Äâ0.05). All paths from the latent variable to the corresponding observed variables were statistically significant ( p <‚Äâ0.001). Conclusion The modified IMB model with extended multilevel factors could serve as a theoretical framework for behavioral interventions for condom use among Chinese MSM. Further prospective studies are needed to examine the predictive power of the modified IMB model.

0.527955807,23842589,Nonconvulsive Electrographic Seizures are Common in Children With Abusive Head Trauma*,"  Objective  To determine the prevalence of nonconvulsive seizures in children with abusive head trauma.    Design  Retrospective study of children with abusive head trauma undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalographic monitoring.    Setting  PICU of a tertiary care hospital.    Subjects  Children less than or equal to 2 years old with evidence of abusive head trauma determined by neuroimaging, physical examination, and determination of abuse by the Child Protection Team.    Interventions  None.    Measurements and Main Results  Thirty-two children with abusive head trauma were identified with a median age of 4 months (interquartile range 3, 5.5 months). Twenty-one of 32 children (66%) underwent electroencephalographic monitoring. Those monitored were more likely to have a lower admission Glasgow Coma Scale (8 vs 15, p = 0.05) and be intubated (16 vs 2, p = 0.002). Electrographic seizures occurred in 12 of 21 children (57%) and constituted electrographic status epilepticus in 8 of 12 children (67%). Electrographic seizures were entirely nonconvulsive in 8 of 12 children (67%). Electroencephalographic background category (discontinuous and slow-disorganized) ( p = 0.02) and neuroimaging evidence of ischemia were associated with the presence of electrographic seizures ( p = 0.05). Subjects who had electrographic seizures were no more likely to have clinical seizures at admission (67% electrographic seizures vs 33% none, p = 0.6), parenchymal imaging abnormalities (61% electrographic seizures vs 39% none, p = 0.40), or extra-axial imaging abnormalities (56% electrographic seizures vs 44% none, p = 0.72). Four of 21 (19%) children died prior to discharge; none had electrographic seizures, but all had attenuated-featureless electroencephalographic backgrounds. Follow-up outcome data were available for 16 of 17 survivors at a median duration of 9.5 months following PICU admission, and the presence of electrographic seizures or electrographic status epilepticus was not associated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale score ( p = 0.10).    Conclusions  Electrographic seizures and electrographic status epilepticus are common in children with abusive head trauma. Most seizures have no clinical correlate.

0.872473015,19368335,Factors controlling the reactivity of hydrogen sulfide with hemeproteins ‚Ä†," Hemoglobin I (HbI) from the clam Lucina pectinata is an intriguing hemeprotein that binds and transports H 2 S to sulfide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria to maintain a symbiotic relationship and to protect the mollusk from H 2 S toxicity. Single point mutations at E7, B10 and E11 positions were introduced in the HbI heme pocket to define the reactivity of sulfide with hemeproteins. The functional and structural properties of mutant and wild type recombinant proteins were first evaluated using the well-known ferrous CO and O 2 derivatives. The effects of these mutations on the ferric environment were then studied in the metaquo and hydrogen sulfide derivatives. The results obtained with the ferrous HbI mutants show that all the E7 substitutions and the PheB10Tyr mutation influence directly CO and O 2 binding and stability while the B10 and E11 substitutions induce distal structural rearrangements that affect ligand entry and escape indirectly. For the metaquo-GlnE7His, PheB10Val, PheB10Leu and the E11 variants, two individual distal structures are suggested, one of which is associated with H-bonding interactions between the E7 residues and the bound water. Similar H-bonding interactions are invoked for these HbI-H 2 S mutant derivatives and the rHbI, altering in turn sulfide reactivity within these protein samples. This is evident in the resonance Raman spectra of these HbI-H 2 S complexes, which show reduction of heme iron as judged by the appearance of the ŒΩ 4 oxidation state marker at 1356 cm ‚àí1 , indicative of heme-Fe II species. This reduction process depends strongly on distal mutations showing faster reduction for those HbI mutants exhibiting strongest H-bonding interactions. Overall, the results presented here show that: a . H 2 S association is regulated by steric constraints; b . H 2 S release is controlled by two competing reactions involving simple sulfide dissociation and heme reduction; c . at high H 2 S concentrations, reduction of the ferric center dominates; d . reduction of the heme is also enhanced in those HbI mutants having polar distal environments.

0.63373593,23912506,Surgical Preparation: Are Patients ‚ÄúReady‚Äù for Stress Urinary Incontinence Surgery?,"  Introduction and Hypothesis:  Patient preparedness for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) surgery is associated with improvements in post-operative satisfaction, symptoms and quality of life (QoL). This planned secondary analysis examined the association of patient preparedness with surgical outcomes, treatment satisfaction and quality of life.    Methods:  The ValUE trial compared the effect of pre-operative urodynamic studies to a standardized office evaluation on outcomes of SUI surgery at one year. In addition to primary and secondary outcome measures, patient satisfaction with treatment was measured with a 5-point Likert scale (very dissatisfied to very satisfied) that queried subjects to rate the treatment‚Äôs effect on overall incontinence, urge incontinence, SUI, and frequency. Preparedness for surgery was assessed using an 11-question Patient Preparedness Questionnaire (PPQ).    Results:  Based on PPQ Question 11, 4 out of 5 (81%) of women reported they ‚Äúagreed‚Äù or ‚Äústrongly agreed‚Äù that they were prepared for surgery. Selected demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in unprepared and prepared women. Among SUI severity baseline measures, total UDI score was significantly but weakly associated with preparedness (question 11 of the PPQ) (Spearman r = 0.13, p = 0.001). Although preparedness for surgery was not associated with successful outcomes, it was associated with satisfaction (r s =0.11, p = 0.02) and larger PGI-S improvement (increase) (p=0.008).    Conclusions:  Approximately half (48%) of women ‚Äústrongly agreed‚Äù that they felt prepared for SUI. Women with higher pre-operative preparedness scores were more satisfied although surgical outcomes did not differ.  ",International urogynecology journal,CLINIC

Results Participants emphasised both the importance of community participation and the lack of consistent engagement by policy-makers and practitioners. All indicated that communities had a key role, though most interventions focused on awareness-raising rather than community empowerment, behaviour change or influence on the design, delivery and/or evaluation of interventions. Conclusions Despite clear consensus around the need to engage, support and empower potentially affected communities and several examples of meaningful community participation in addressing FGM (eg, REPLACE, REPLACE 2, Ketenaapak , Tackling FGM Initiative), the role of communities remains inconsistent and further engagement efforts are necessary.",BMJ open,EPIDEM
0.615642203,25437025,Independent Influence of Overweight and Obesity on the Regression of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Hypertensive Patients A Meta-analysis,"Abstract Overweight and obesity are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, the role of overweight and obesity in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of hypertensive patients is controversial. The aim of the current meta-analysis was to evaluate the influence of overweight and obesity on LVH regression in the hypertensive population. Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials comprising 2403 hypertensive patients (mean age range: 43.8‚Äì66.7 years) were identified. Three groups were divided according to body mass index: normal weight, overweight, and obesity groups. Compared with the normal-weight group, LVH regression in the overweight and obesity groups was more obvious with less reduction of systolic blood pressure after antihypertensive therapies ( P <‚Ää0.001). The renin‚Äìangiotensin system inhibitor was the most effective in regressing LVH in overweight and obese hypertensive patients (19.27‚Ääg/m 2 , 95% confidence interval [15.25, 23.29], P <‚Ää0.001), followed by Œ≤-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. In the stratified analysis based on blood pressure measurement methods and age, more significant LVH regression was found in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) group and in relatively young patients (40‚Äì60 years‚Äô old) group ( P <‚Ää0.01). Overweight and obesity are independent risk factors for LVH in hypertensive patients. Intervention at an early age and monitoring by ABPM may facilitate therapy-induced LVH regression in overweight and obese hypertensive patients.",Medicine,CLINIC
0.593463362,24163796,Reversible Germ Cell Toxicity of Sulphasalazine and Ampicillin Combination in Male Rats,"Background The antifertility effect of ampicillin (AMP, 40 mg/kg ) and sulphasalazine or salicylazosulfapyridine (SASP, 300,450 and 600 mg/kg ) in male rats has been reported earlier. The combination of AMP and SASP is generally used in certain pathological conditions, but the combined effect of these two drugs on the fertility is not clear. So, the aim of this study was to investigate the antifertility effect of ampicillin and sulphasalazine combination in male rats. Methods In the present study, forty rats were randomly divided into five groups (n=8). Group I served as the control, while Group II and III received AMP and SASP at the doses of 20 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg respectively. Moreover, group IV and V received the combination of SASP (100 mg/kg ) and AMP (10 mg/kg ). However, for evaluating the reversible effect of the combination, a washout period of 30 days was given in group V. After 45 days of drug treatment, each rat was sacrificed. The testes, seminal vesicles and epididymis were dissected & weighed. Furthermore, fertility tests, sperm characteristic analysis, histopathological studies, testosterone assay and tissue biochemistry were performed. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and in case ANOVA shows statistical differences, post hoc analysis was performed. Results A decrease in parameters related to fertility of males such as sperm count, sperm motility, fertility ratio, serum testosterone level, glycogen and protein content in sexual organs was observed. Although AMP and SASP significantly (p<0.001) reduced the reproductive activity separately, but their combination was found to be impairing the reproductive activity at a considerably lower dose. However, on withdrawing the treatment, all these parameters were restored which was confirmed by the histopathological analysis of the testis. Conclusion The combination produces synergistic antifertility effect in male rats and the effect was reversible. The dose and efficacy of results could be extrapolated in future clinical trials.",Journal of reproduction & infertility,BIOCHEM

Method Sixty patients with hemiparesis after stroke were included (41 males and 19 females, average age 63.3 years). Twenty patients had NMES applied and simultaneously underwent mirror therapy. Twenty patients had NMES applied only, and twenty patients underwent mirror therapy only. Each treatment was done five days per week, 30 minutes per day, for three weeks. NMES was applied on the surface of the extensor digitorum communis and extensor pollicis brevis for open-hand motion. Muscle tone, Fugl-Meyer assessment, and power of wrist and hand were evaluated before and after treatment. Results There were significant improvements in the Fugl-Meyer assessment score in the wrist, hand and coordination, as well as power of wrist and hand in all groups after treatment. The mirror and NMES group showed significant improvements in the Fugl-Meyer scores of hand, wrist, coordination and power of hand extension compared to the other groups. However, the power of hand flexion, wrist flexion, and wrist extension showed no significant differences among the three groups. Muscle tone also showed no significant differences in the three groups. Conclusion Our results showed that there is a synergic effect of mirror therapy and NMES on hand function. Therefore, a hand rehabilitation strategy combined with NMES and mirror therapy may be more helpful for improving hand function in stroke patients than NMES or mirror therapy only.",Annals of rehabilitation medicine,PHYSIO
0.931889104,26413478,Neural signal during immediate reward anticipation in schizophrenia: Relationship to real-world motivation and function,"Amotivation in schizophrenia is a central predictor of poor functioning, and is thought to occur due to deficits in anticipating future rewards, suggesting that impairments in anticipating pleasure can contribute to functional disability in schizophrenia. In healthy comparison (HC) participants, reward anticipation is associated with activity in frontal‚Äìstriatal networks. By contrast, schizophrenia (SZ) participants show hypoactivation within these frontal‚Äìstriatal networks during this motivated anticipatory brain state. Here, we examined neural activation in SZ and HC participants during the anticipatory phase of stimuli that predicted immediate upcoming reward and punishment, and during the feedback/outcome phase, in relation to trait measures of hedonic pleasure and real-world functional capacity. SZ patients showed hypoactivation in ventral striatum during reward anticipation. Additionally, we found distinct differences between HC and SZ groups in their association between reward-related immediate anticipatory neural activity and their reported experience of pleasure. HC participants recruited reward-related regions in striatum that significantly correlated with subjective consummatory pleasure, while SZ patients revealed activation in attention-related regions, such as the IPL, which correlated with consummatory pleasure and functional capacity. These findings may suggest that SZ patients activate compensatory attention processes during anticipation of immediate upcoming rewards, which likely contribute to their functional capacity in daily life. Highlights ‚Ä¢ Schizophrenia patients show frontal‚Äìstriatal impairment during reward anticipation. ‚Ä¢ Patients recruit additional inferior parietal lobes (IPL) during reward anticipation. ‚Ä¢ IPL activation may contribute to motivation and functional enhancements in SZ.",NeuroImage.

0.794289075,20353570,Factors associated with early menarche: results from the French Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study,"Background Puberty is a transition period making physiological development a challenge adolescents have to face. Early pubertal development could be associated with higher risks of poor health. Our objective was to examine risk behaviours, physical and psychological determinants associated with early menarche (<11 years). Methods Early menarche was assessed in the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children French cross-sectional survey. Data were collected in 2006 by anonymous self-reported standardized questionnaire from a nationally representative sample of 1072 15 years old girls in school classrooms. Family environment, school experience, physical and psychological factors, risk behaviours (substance use and sexual initiation) were recorded. Logistic regression models were applied (analysing for crude and adjusted relationships between early menarche and risk behaviours controlled for family context). Results Median age at menarche was 13.0 years; 57 girls (5.3%) were early-matured. Controlled for familial environment, early menarche was associated with having had more than two life-drunkenness episodes (adjusted OR = 2.5 [1.3-4.6]), early sexual initiation (adjusted OR = 2.8 [1.3-6.0]) and overweight (adjusted OR = 7.3 [3.6-14.9]). Conclusion Early-maturing girls may affiliate with older adolescents, hence engage in risk behaviours linked to their appearance rather than their maturity level. Factors associated with early menarche highlight the need to focus attention on early-matured girls to prevent further health problems linked to risk behaviours.",BMC public health,EPIDEM
0.305512498,23826372,Genome-Wide Responses of Female Fruit Flies Subjected to Divergent Mating Regimes,"Elevated rates of mating and reproduction cause decreased female survival and lifetime reproductive success across a wide range of taxa from flies to humans. These costs are fundamentally important to the evolution of life histories. Here we investigate the potential mechanistic basis of this classic life history component. We conducted 4 independent replicated experiments in which female Drosophila melanogaster were subjected to ‚Äòhigh‚Äô and ‚Äòlow‚Äô mating regimes, resulting in highly significant differences in lifespan. We sampled females for transcriptomic analysis at day 10 of life, before the visible onset of ageing, and used Tiling expression arrays to detect differential gene expression in two body parts (abdomen versus head+thorax). The divergent mating regimes were associated with significant differential expression in a network of genes showing evidence for interactions with ecdysone receptor . Preliminary experimental manipulation of two genes in that network with roles in post-transcriptional modification ( CG11486, eyegone ) tended to enhance sensitivity to mating costs. However, the subtle nature of those effects suggests substantial functional redundancy or parallelism in this gene network, which could buffer females against excessive responses. There was also evidence for differential expression in genes involved in germline maintenance, cell proliferation and in gustation / odorant reception. Interestingly, we detected differential expression in three specific genes ( EcR, keap1, lbk1 ) and one class of genes (gustation / odorant receptors) with previously reported roles in determining lifespan. Our results suggest that high and low mating regimes that lead to divergence in lifespan are associated with changes in the expression of genes such as reproductive hormones, that influence resource allocation to the germ line, and that may modify post-translational gene expression. This predicts that the correct signalling of nutrient levels to the reproductive system is important for maintaining organismal integrity.",PloS one,ANIMAL

0.422522845,29082660,Anellovirus loads are associated with outcomes in pediatric lung transplantation," Anelloviruses are DNA viruses ubiquitously present in human blood. Due to their elevated levels in immunosuppressed patients, anellovirus levels have been proposed as a marker of immune status. We hypothesized that low anellovirus levels, reflecting relative immunocompetence, would be associated with adverse outcomes in pediatric lung transplantation. We assayed blood samples from 57 patients in a multicenter study for alpha- and betatorquevirus, two anellovirus genera. The primary short-term outcome of interest was acute rejection, and longer-term outcomes were analyzed individually and as ‚Äúcomposite‚Äù (death, chronic rejection, or retransplant within two years). Patients with low alphatorquevirus levels at two weeks post-transplantation were more likely to develop acute rejection within three months after transplant (p=0.013). Low betatorquevirus levels at six weeks and six months after transplant were associated with death (p=0.047) and the composite outcome (p=0.017), respectively. There was an association between low anellovirus levels and adverse outcomes in pediatric lung transplantation. Alphatorquevirus levels were associated with short-term outcomes (i.e., acute rejection) while betatorquevirus levels were associated with longer-term outcomes (i.e., death, or composite outcome within two years). These observations suggest that anelloviruses may serve as useful biomarkers of immune status and predictors of adverse outcomes. ",Pediatric transplantation,CLINIC
0.069131566,21394775,Measurement of glycine in the human brain in vivo by  1 H-MRS at 3T: Application in brain tumors," Glycine (Gly) is a key metabolic intermediate required for the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids and other molecules, and its detection in cancer could therefore provide biologically relevant information about the growth of the tumor. Here we report measurement of Gly in human brain and gliomas by an optimized point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence at 3T. Echo time dependence of the major obstacle, myo -inositol (mI) multiplet, was investigated with numerical simulations, incorporating the 3D volume localization. The simulations indicated that a subecho pair (TE 1 , TE 2 ) = (60, 100) ms permits detection of both Gly and mI with optimum selectivity. In vivo validation of the optimized PRESS was conducted on the right parietal cortex of five healthy volunteers. Metabolite signals estimated from LCModel were normalized with respect to the brain water signal and the concentrations were evaluated assuming the total creatine concentration at 8 mM. The Gly concentration was estimated as 0.6¬±0.1 mM (mean¬±SD, n=5), with a mean Cram√©r-Rao lower bound of 9¬±1%. The PRESS sequence was applied to measure the Gly levels in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Metabolite concentrations were obtained using the water signal from the tumor mass. The study revealed that a subset of human gliomas contains glycine levels elevated 1.5‚Äì8 fold relative to normal. ",Magnetic resonance in medicine,ONCO
0.702495071,29355368,Profiles of Minority Stressors and Identity Centrality Among Sexual Minority Latinx Youth," Few studies have examined how the amalgamation of minority stressors for youth with multiple marginalized identities is associated with well-being. Additionally, among youth with multiple marginalized identities, identity centrality may clarify the associations between specific types of minority stressors (i.e., bias-based peer victimization, perceived discrimination) and adjustment. This study sought to identify intersectional profiles of perceived peer victimization, perceived discrimination, and identity centrality, specific to either Latinx ethnicity or sexual minority identity in the U.S. Demographic characteristics associated with each profile (i.e., age, SES, gender nonconformity, survey language, gender, rurality) were examined, as well as associations between profiles and grade-point average (GPA), self-esteem, and depression. In a sample of 219 in-school Latinx sexual minority youth (47% secondary, 53% post-secondary; M age = 19, SD = 2.3), four profiles of intersectional minority stress (perceived victimization, discrimination) and identity centrality were identified: a) low stress, low centrality; b) low stress, high centrality; c) moderate stress, moderate centrality, and d) high stress, moderate centrality. Men, youth who were relatively older, socioeconomically advantaged, gender nonconforming, and in urban areas had higher probabilities of membership in profiles with moderate and high stress. Compared to the low stress, low centrality profile, profiles with higher levels of intersectional stress were associated with maladjustment, whereas the profile characterized by low stress, high centrality had higher levels of self-esteem.

0.672226668,31239790,Nasal sound pressure as objective verification of implant in active transcutaneous bone conduction devices,"Objective: Active transcutaneous bone conduction devices consist of an external audio processor and an internal implant under intact skin. During the surgical procedure, it is important to verify the functionality of the implant before the surgical wound is closed. In a clinical study with the new bone conduction implant (BCI), the functionality of the implant was tested with an electric transmission test, where the output was the nasal sound pressure (NSP) recorded in the ipsilateral nostril. The same measurement was performed in all follow-up visits to monitor the implant's functionality and transmission to bone over time. The objective of this study was to investigate the validity of the NSP method as a tool to objectively verify the implant's performance intraoperatively, as well as to follow-up the implant's performance over time. Design: Thirteen patients with the BCI were included, and the NSP measurement was part of the clinical study protocol. The implant was electrically stimulated with an amplitude-modulated signal generator using a swept sine 0.1‚Äì10 kHz. The NSP was measured with a probe tube microphone in the ipsilateral nostril. Results: The NSP during surgery was above the noise floor for most patients within the frequency interval 0.4‚Äì5 kHz, showing NSP values for expected normal transmission of a functioning implant. Inter-subject comparison showed large variability, but follow-up results showed only minor variability within each subject. Further investigation showed that the NSP was stable over time. Conclusion: The NSP method is considered applicable to verify the implant's functionality during and after surgery. Such a method is important for implantable devices, but should be simplified and clinically adapted. Large variations between subjects were found, as well as smaller variability in intra-subject comparisons. As the NSP was found to not change significantly over time, stable transmission to bone, and implant functionality, were indicated. Video abstract Point your SmartPhone at the code above.

0.881301588,28222713,The mental health status of refugees and asylum seekers attending a refugee health clinic including comparisons with a matched sample of Australian-born residents,"Background The aim of this study was to survey refugees and asylum-seekers attending a Refugee Health Service in Melbourne, Australia to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders based on screening measures and with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specifically highlighted. A secondary aim was to compare the prevalence findings with Australian-born matched comparators from the 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 135 refugees and asylum-seeker participants using instruments including Kessler-10 (K10) and PTSD-8 to obtain estimates of the prevalence of mental disorders. We also performed a comparative analysis using matched sets of one participant and four Australian-born residents, comparing prevalence results with conditional Poisson regression estimated risk ratios (RR). Results The prevalence of mental illness as measured by K10 was 50.4%, while 22.9% and 31.3% of participants screened positive for PTSD symptoms in the previous month and lifetime, respectively. The matched analysis yielded a risk ratio of 3.16 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.30, 4.34] for abnormal K10, 2.25 (95% CI: 1.53, 3.29) for PTSD-lifetime and 4.44 (95% CI: 2.64, 7.48) for PTSD-month. Conclusions This information on high absolute and relative risk of mental illness substantiate the increased need for mental health screening and care in this and potentially other refugee clinics and should be considered in relation to service planning. While the results cannot be generalised outside this setting, the method may be more broadly applicable, enabling the rapid collection of key information to support service planning for new waves of refugees and asylum-seekers.

Results The model was highly predictive of mortality (C statistic=0.93), and well calibrated by risk stratum. There was substantial overdispersion. No trusts were more than 3 SDs above the mean, and only one trust was more than 2 SDs above the mean for 2010/2011. Conclusions QUORUM is highly predictive of patient mortality in hospital or up to 30‚ÄÖdays after admission. However, like the Summary Hospital Mortality Indicator (SHMI), QUORUM is subjected to considerable remaining legitimate but unexplained variation. It is unlikely that measures like QUORUM and SHMI will be useful beyond identifying a very small number of trusts as potential outliers.",BMJ open,CLINIC
0.868312277,20438651,A conformal Bayesian network for classification of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  complex lineages,"Background We present a novel conformal Bayesian network (CBN) to classify strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) into six major genetic lineages based on two high-throuput biomarkers: mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) and spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping). MTBC is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), which remains one of the leading causes of disease and morbidity world-wide. DNA fingerprinting methods such as MIRU and spoligotyping are key components in the control and tracking of modern TB. Results CBN is designed to exploit background knowledge about MTBC biomarkers. It can be trained on large historical TB databases of various subsets of MTBC biomarkers. During TB control efforts not all biomarkers may be available. So, CBN is designed to predict the major lineage of isolates genotyped by any combination of the PCR-based typing methods: spoligotyping and MIRU typing. CBN achieves high accuracy on three large MTBC collections consisting of over 34,737 isolates genotyped by different combinations of spoligotypes, 12 loci of MIRU, and 24 loci of MIRU. CBN captures distinct MIRU and spoligotype signatures associated with each lineage, explaining its excellent performance. Visualization of MIRU and spoligotype signatures yields insight into both how the model works and the genetic diversity of MTBC. Conclusions CBN conforms to the available PCR-based biological markers and achieves high performance in identifying major lineages of MTBC. The method can be readily extended as new biomarkers are introduced for TB tracking and control.

0.608462372,30419896,Development and pilot evaluation of a pregnancy-specific mobile health tool: a qualitative investigation of  SmartMoms Canada,"Background Mobile technology is ubiquitous. Women of childbearing age have embraced health information technology for pregnancy-related counsel as prenatal care provider communication is increasingly scarce and brief. Pregnant women and new mothers place high value in the use of online sources to support their pregnancy information needs. In Canada, over 300,000 women are pregnant annually, with approximately 60% exceeding evidence-based weight gain recommendations. Mobile health (mHealth) tools, such as mobile applications (app), have the potential to reduce excessive gestational weight gain, offering pregnant women trustworthy guidance, ultimately improving the health outcomes of mothers and infants. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to implement a qualitative, descriptive research design to assess the receptiveness, functionality, and future prospective of the SmartMoms Canada mHealth app. Methods Two focus groups ( n =‚Äâ13) involving both currently pregnant and recently postpartum women were organized on the same day. Focus groups were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was undertaken using manual coding and NVivo software. Participants who took part in the focus groups (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ13) and those who could not attend ( n =‚Äâ4) were asked to complete a Likert-scale survey. All survey responses ( n =‚Äâ17) were analyzed using simple tabulation and percentage analysis. Results Participants were technologically proficient and interacted with several mHealth tools prior to testing the SmartMoms Canada app. Six major themes emerged from thematic analysis: knowledge of pregnancy-specific mHealth services, knowledge and attitudes of weight gain guidelines, weight tracking, strengths of the app, critique and lastly, future suggestions for the app. Conclusions Our thematic analysis found that women positively viewed the future potential of our app and offered constructive feedback to improve the next version.

0.962969286,25957157,"Non-Smoker Exposure to Secondhand Cannabis Smoke II: Effect of Room Ventilation on the Physiological, Subjective, and Behavioral/Cognitive Effects","  Introduction  Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug. Many individuals are incidentally exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke, but little is known about the effects of this exposure. This report examines the physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive effects of secondhand cannabis exposure, and the influence of room ventilation on these effects.    Methods  Non-cannabis-using individuals were exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke from six individuals smoking cannabis (11.3% THC) ad libitum in a specially constructed chamber for one hour. Chamber ventilation was experimentally manipulated so that participants were exposed under unventilated conditions or with ventilation at a rate of 11 air exchanges/hour. Physiological, subjective and behavioral/cognitive measures of cannabis exposure assessed after exposure sessions were compared to baseline measures.    Results  Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke under unventilated conditions produced detectable cannabinoid levels in blood and urine, minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate self-reported sedative drug effects, and impaired performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST). One urine specimen tested positive at using a 50 ng/mL cut-off and several specimens were positive at 20 ng/mL. Exposure under ventilated conditions resulted in much lower blood cannabinoid levels, and did not produce sedative drug effects, impairments in performance, or positive urine screen results.    Conclusions  Room ventilation has a pronounced effect on exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke. Under extreme, unventilated conditions, secondhand cannabis smoke exposure can produce detectable levels of THC in blood and urine, minor physiological and subjective drug effects, and minor impairment on a task requiring psychomotor ability and working memory.

0.844682437,20889416,Anechoic Sphere Phantoms for Estimating 3-D Resolution of Very High Frequency Ultrasound Scanners," Two phantoms have been constructed for assessing the performance of high frequency ultrasound imagers. They also allow for periodic quality assurance tests. The phantoms contain eight blocks of tissue-mimicking material where each block contains a spatially random distribution of suitably small anechoic spheres having a small distribution of diameters. The eight mean sphere diameters are distributed from 0.10 to 1.09 mm. The two phantoms differ primarily in terms of the backscatter coefficient of the background material in which the spheres are suspended. The mean scatterer diameter for one phantom is larger than that for the other phantom resulting in a lesser increase in backscatter coefficient for the second phantom; however, the backscatter curves cross at about 35 MHz. Since spheres have no preferred orientation, all three (spatial) dimensions of resolution contribute to sphere detection on an equal basis; thus, the resolution is termed 3-D. Two high frequency scanners are compared. One employs single-element (fixed focus) transducers, and the other employs variable focus linear arrays. The nominal frequency for the single element transducers were 25 and 55 MHz and for the linear array transducers were 20, 30 and 40 MHz. The depth range for detection of spheres of each size is determined corresponding to determination of 3-D resolution as a function of depth. As expected, the single-element transducers are severely limited in useful imaging depth ranges compared with the linear arrays. Note that these phantoms could also be useful for training technicians in using higher frequency scanners. ","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",ENG

This study was performed to investigate whether diclofenac sodium (DFS) potentiates the cardiotoxicity of tulathromycin and increases the cardioprotective effects of lycopene against DFS and tulathromycin. Seven groups (eight per group) of adult Swiss albino mice received saline (control), tulathromycin (a single subcutaneous dose of 28 mg/kg/bw on day 14), DFS (a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg/bw on day 14), tulathromycin plus DFS, or lycopene (oral, 10 mg/kg/bw daily for 15 d) combined with tulathromycin, DFS, or both. Compared to the control group, the administration of tulathromycin or DFS (individually or in combination) caused significantly elevated ( p < 0.05) serum levels of Creatine kinase-myocardial B fraction (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase, and cardiac-specific troponin-T and tissue levels of nitric oxide and malondialdehyde that were accompanied by significantly decreased tissue reduced glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase antioxidant enzyme activity. Upon histopathological and immunohistochemical examination, the mean pathology scores and the percentages of caspase-3-, Bax-, and CK-positive regions were significantly higher in the tulathromycin- and/or DFS-treated groups than in control mice. For all these parameters, the pathological changes were more significant in the tulathromycin‚ÄìDFS combination group than in mice treated with either drug individually. Interestingly, co-administration of lycopene with tulathromycin and/or DFS significantly ameliorated the changes described above. In conclusion, DFS could potentiate the cardiotoxic effects of tulathromycin, whereas lycopene can serve as a cardioprotective agent against DFS and tulathromycin.",International journal of molecular sciences,BIOCHEM

A homogenous fluorescence-based assay was devised to detect aggregated proteins inside aggresomes and inclusion bodies within an authentic cellular context. The assay employs a novel red fluorescent molecular rotor dye, which is essentially nonfluorescent until it binds to structural features associated with the aggregated protein cargo. Aggresomes and related structures were generated within cultured cells using various potent, cell permeable, proteasome inhibitors: MG-132, lactacystin, epoxomicin and bortezomib, and then selectively detected with the fluorescent probe. Employing the probe in combination with various fluorescein-labeled primary antibodies facilitated co-localization of key components of the autophagy system (ubiquitin, p62, and LC3) with aggregated protein cargo by fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, cytoplasmic aggregates were highlighted in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells incubated with exogenously supplied amyloid beta peptide 1‚Äì42. SMER28, a small molecule modulator of autophagy acting via an mTOR-independent mechanism, prevented the accumulation of amyloid beta peptide within these cells. The described assay allows assessment of the effects of protein aggregation directly in cells, without resorting to the use of non-physiological protein mutations or genetically engineered cell lines.

In contrast, we found that HIV-1 replication was significantly decreased in 293T and TZM-b1 cells with siRNA-mediated Pom121 knockdown. Quantitative PCR indicated that viral replication was impaired at the step of cDNA nuclear import. Furthermore, we found that karyopherin-Œ≤1 (KPNB1), which belongs to the importin-Œ≤ family, interacts with Pom121 and is involved in Pom121-mediated PIC nuclear import. Rescue experiment indicated that the FG-repeats and the following Œ±-helix in Pom121 are required for its role in HIV-1 PIC nuclear import.

From these 45 patients, 63 tissue locations or samples were identified and imaged with the confocal microlaparoscope. Twenty of the samples were high-grade cancers and the remaining 43 samples were normal or non-cancerous. Twenty-three of the samples were imaged in vivo and the remaining 40 samples were imaged ex vivo . The average AUC score and standard error (SE) for detection of cancer in all images were 0.88 and 0.02, respectively. An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare AUC scores for in vivo and ex vivo conditions. No statistically significant difference in the AUC score for in vivo (AUC=0.850, SE=0.049) and ex vivo (AUC=0.888, SE=0.027) conditions was observed; t(6)=1.318, p=0.2355.    Conclusions  AUC scores indicate that high-resolution in vivo images obtained by the confocal laparoscope can distinguish between normal and malignant ovarian surface epithelium. In addition, in vivo performance is similar to that which can be obtained from ex vivo tissue.

0.989733442,24128682,Upregulation of Adenosine Kinase in Rasmussen Encephalitis,"Abstract Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is a rare neurologic disorder of childhood characterized by unihemispheric inflammation, progressive neurologic deficits, and intractable focal epilepsy. The pathogenesis of RE is still enigmatic. Adenosine is a key endogenous signaling molecule with anticonvulsive and anti-inflammatory effects, and our previous work demonstrated that dysfunction of the adenosine kinase (ADK)‚Äìadenosine system and astrogliosis are the hallmarks of epilepsy. We hypothesized that the epileptogenic mechanisms underlying RE are related to changes in ADK expression and that those changes might be associated with the development of epilepsy in RE patients. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of ADK and glial fibrillary acidic protein in surgically resected human epileptic cortical specimens from RE patients (n = 12) and compared with control cortical tissues (n = 6). Adenosine kinase expression using Western blot and enzymatic activity for ADK were assessed in RE versus control samples. Focal astrogliosis and marked expression of ADK were observed in the lesions of RE. Significantly greater ADK expression in RE versus controls was demonstrated by Western blot, and greater enzymatic activity for ADK was demonstrated using an enzyme-coupled bioluminescent assay. These results suggest that upregulation of ADK is a common pathologic hallmark of RE and that ADK might be a target in the treatment of epilepsy associated with RE.",Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,BIOCHEM
0.61859253,31435567,Dash-Associated Spondylolysis Hypothesis,"Introduction In past biomechanical studies, repetitive motion of lumbar extension, rotation, or a combination of both, frequently seen in batting or pitching practice in baseball, shooting practice in soccer, and spiking practice in volleyball, have been considered important risk factors of lumbar spondylolysis. However, clinically, these have been identified in many athletes performing on a running track or on the field, which requires none of the practices described above. The purpose of this study was to verify how much impact running has on the pathologic mechanism of lumbar spondylolysis. Methods In study 1, 89 consecutive pediatric patients diagnosed with lumbar spondylolysis at a single outpatient clinic between January 2012 and February 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. In study 2, motion analysis was performed on 17 male volunteers who had played on a soccer team without experiencing low back pain or any type of musculoskeletal injury. A Vicon motion capture system was used to evaluate four movements: maximal effort sprint (Dash), comfortable running (Jog), instep kick (Shoot), and inside kick (Pass). Results In study 1, 13 of the 89 patients with lumbar spondylolysis were track and field athletes. In study 2, motion analysis revealed that the hip extension angle, spine rotation angle, and hip flexion moment were similar in Dash and Shoot during the maximum hip extension phase. The pelvic rotation angle was significantly greater in the kicking conditions than in the running conditions. Conclusions Kinematically and kinetically, the spinopelvic angles in Dash were considered similar to those in Shoot. Dash could cause mechanical stress at the pars interarticularis of the lumbar spine, similar to that caused by Shoot, thus leading to spondylolysis.",Spine surgery and related research,CLINIC
0.467743858,29582934,Mining Major Transitions of Chronic Conditions in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions," Summary   Objectives  Evolution of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) follows a complex stochastic process, influenced by several factors including the inter-relationship of existing conditions, and patient-level risk factors. Nearly 20% of citizens aged 18 years and older are burdened with two or more (multiple) chronic conditions (MCC). Treatment for people living with MCC currently accounts for an estimated 66% of the Nation‚Äôs healthcare costs. However, it is still not known precisely how MCC emerge and accumulate among individuals or in the general population. This study investigates major patterns of MCC transitions in a diverse population of patients and identifies the risk factors affecting the transition process.    Methods  A Latent regression Markov clustering (LRMCL) algorithm is proposed to identify major transitions of four MCC that include hypertension (HTN), depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and back pain. A cohort of 601,805 individuals randomly selected from the population of Iraq and Afghanistan war Veterans (IAVs) who received VA care during three or more years between 2002-2015, is used for training the proposed LRMCL algorithm.    Results  Two major clusters of MCC transition patterns with 78% and 22% probability of membership respectively were identified. The primary cluster demonstrated the possibility of improvement when the number of MCC is small and an increase in probability of MCC accumulation as the number of comorbidities increased. The second cluster showed stability (no change) of MCC overtime as the major pattern. Age was the most significant risk factor associated with the most probable cluster for each IAV.    Conclusions  These findings suggest that our proposed LRMCL algorithm can be used to describe and understand MCC transitions, which may ultimately allow healthcare systems to support optimal clinical decision-making. This method will be used to describe a broader range of MCC transitions in this and non-VA populations, and will add treatment information to see if models including treatments and MCC emergence can be used to support clinical decision-making in patient care.

0.600148158,20204454,Genetic factors that influence moenomycin production in streptomycetes," Moenomycin, a natural phosphoglycolipid product that has long history of use in animal nutrition, is currently considered attractive starting point for the development of novel antibiotics. We recently reconstituted the biosynthesis of this natural product in a heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans TK24, but production levels were too low to be useful. We have examined several other streptomycetes strains as hosts and have also explored the overexpression of two pleiotropic regulatory genes, afsS and relA , on moenomycin production. A moenomycin-resistant derivative of S. albus J1074 was found to give the highest titers of moenomycin and production was improved by overexpressing relA . Partial duplication of moe cluster 1 in S. ghanaensis also increased average moenomycin production. The results reported here suggest that rational manipulations of global regulators combined with increased moe gene dosage could be a useful for improvement of moenomycin biosynthesis.

0.700543879,28506225,HealthRecSys: A semantic content-based recommender system to complement health videos,"Background The Internet, and its popularity, continues to grow at an unprecedented pace. Watching videos online is very popular; it is estimated that 500¬†h of video are uploaded onto YouTube, a video-sharing service, every minute and that, by 2019, video formats will comprise more than 80% of Internet traffic. Health-related videos are very popular on YouTube, but their quality is always a matter of concern. One approach to enhancing the quality of online videos is to provide additional educational health content, such as websites, to support health consumers. This study investigates the feasibility of building a content-based recommender system that links health consumers to reputable health educational websites from MedlinePlus for a given health video from YouTube. Methods The dataset for this study includes a collection of health-related videos and their available metadata. Semantic technologies (such as SNOMED-CT and Bio-ontology) were used to recommend health websites from MedlinePlus. A total of 26 healths professionals participated in evaluating 253 recommended links for a total of 53 videos about general health, hypertension, or diabetes. The relevance of the recommended health websites from MedlinePlus to the videos was measured using information retrieval metrics such as the normalized discounted cumulative gain and precision at K. Results The majority of websites recommended by our system for health videos were relevant, based on ratings by health professionals. The normalized discounted cumulative gain was between 46% and 90% for the different topics. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using a semantic content-based recommender system to enrich YouTube health videos. Evaluation with end-users, in addition to healthcare professionals, will be required to identify the acceptance of these recommendations in a nonsimulated information-seeking context.

There are, however, two problems, specific to optical microscopy imaging of neurons, which make accurate neuron tracing exceedingly challenging: ( i ) neurites can appear broken due to inhomogeneous labeling and ( ii ) neurites can appear fused in 3D due to limited resolution. Here, we propose and evaluate several artificial neural network (ANN) architectures and conventional image enhancement filters with the aim of alleviating both problems. We developed four image quality metrics to evaluate the effects of the proposed filters: normalized intensity in the cross-over regions between neurites, effective radius of neurites, coefficient of variation of intensity along neurites, and local background to neurite intensity ratio. Our results show that ANN-based filters, trained on optimized semi-manual traces of neurites, can significantly outperform conventional filters. In particular, U-Net based filtering can virtually eliminate background intensity, while also reducing the effective radius of neurites to nearly 1 voxel. In addition, this filter significantly decreases intensity in the cross-over regions between neurites and reduces fluctuations of intensity on neurites‚Äô centerlines. These results suggest that including an ANN-based filtering step, which does not require substantial extra time or computing power, can be beneficial for automated neuron tracing projects.

0.604665937,29399417,A calendar method of collecting remittance use data in a remittance dependent setting of Nepal 1," This methodological paper describes the design and refinement of a calendar method of collecting data on remittance receipt and remittance use and its piloting in a rural remittance dependent setting of Nepal. Much of the previous national surveys collected remittance receipt and remittance use cross-sectional data that used a time frame ranging from 12 ‚Äì 24 months. These surveys collected remittance receipt data by asking, ‚ÄòHow much money has he/she sent in the past 12 months or 2 years?‚Äô We believe that the long time frame of one to two years adds burden to respondents for unnecessary calculations and is prone to re-call bias. Moreover, these surveys used vague words such as ‚Äòcapital formation‚Äô or ‚Äòdaily consumption‚Äô to measure the uses of remittances. Thus, the instrument per se is unreliable posing threats to collecting valid responses. Considering these flaws, in 2013, we designed a calendar with shorter timing cues and simple words for collecting longitudinal data on remittance receipt and remittance use. First, we describe the calendar design process. Next, we provide descriptive results of household responses on the amount of remittance received and the remittance used on various socio-economic and cultural dimensions of household activities. The implications of the insights gained from this study are discussed. ",Migration and development,EPIDEM
0.922568865,19641596,Presenilins are Essential for Regulating Neurotransmitter Release,"Summary Mutations in the presenilin genes are the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Loss of presenilin activity and/or accumulation of amyloid-Œ≤ peptides have been proposed to mediate the pathogenesis of AD by impairing synaptic function 1 - 5 . However, the precise site and nature of the synaptic dysfunction remain unknown. Here we employ a genetic approach to inactivate presenilins conditionally in either presynaptic (CA3) or postsynaptic (CA1) neurons of the hippocampal Schaeffer-collateral pathway. We found that long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta burst stimulation is decreased after presynaptic but not postsynaptic deletion of presenilins. Moreover, presynaptic but not postsynaptic inactivation of presenilins alters short-term plasticity and synaptic facilitation. The probability of evoked glutamate release, measured with the open-channel NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, is reduced by presynaptic inactivation of presenilins. Strikingly, depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -stores by thapsigargin or blockade of Ca 2+ -release from these stores by ryanodine receptor inhibitors mimics and occludes the effects of presynaptic presenilin inactivation. Collectively, these results reveal a selective role for presenilins in the activity-dependent regulation of neurotransmitter release and LTP induction via modulation of intracellular Ca 2+ -release in presynaptic terminals, and further suggest that presynaptic dysfunction might be an early pathogenic event leading to dementia and neurodegeneration in AD.",Nature,BIOCHEM

Methods  One hundred post-treatment endometrial cancer survivors received a 6-month home-based exercise intervention. EMAs were conducted using hand-held computers for 10- to 12-day periods every 2 months. Participants rated morning self-efficacy and positive and negative outcome expectations using the computer, recorded exercise information in real time and at night, and wore accelerometers. At the midpoint of each assessment period participants completed SCT questionnaires. Using linear mixed-effects models, we tested whether morning SCT variables predicted minutes of exercise that day (Question 1) and whether exercise minutes at time point T j could be predicted by questionnaire measures of SCT variables from time point T j-1 (Question 2).    Results  Morning self-efficacy significantly predicted that day‚Äôs exercise minutes (p<.0001). Morning positive outcome expectations was also associated with exercise minutes (p=0.0003), but the relationship was attenuated when self-efficacy was included in the model (p=0.4032). Morning negative outcome expectations was not associated with exercise minutes. Of the questionnaire measures of SCT variables, only exercise self-efficacy predicted exercise at the next time point (p=0.003).    Conclusions  The consistency of the relationship between self-efficacy and exercise minutes over short (same day) and longer ( T j to T j-1 ) time periods provides support for a causal relationship. The strength of the relationship between morning self-efficacy and exercise minutes suggest that real-time interventions that target daily variation in self-efficacy may benefit endometrial cancer survivors‚Äô exercise adherence.

Research design and methods Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data for 2008‚Äì2010 were used to identify individuals with diabetes and their preventive care usage. Each Appalachian respondent county of residence was categorised into one of the five economic levels: distressed, at-risk, transitional, competitive and attainment counties. Competitive and attainment counties were combined and designated as competitive counties. We used logistic regressions to compare receipt of ADA preventive care recommendations by county economic level, adjusting for respondent demographic, socioeconomic, health and access-to-care factors. Results Compared to the most affluent (competitive) counties, less affluent (distressed and at-risk) counties demonstrated equivalent or higher rates of self-care practices such as daily blood glucose monitoring and daily foot checks. But they showed 40‚Äì50% lower uptake of annual foot and eye examinations and 30% lower uptake of diabetes education and pneumococcal vaccinations compared to competitive counties. After adjusting for demographic factors, significant disparities still existed in the uptake of annual foot examinations, annual eye examinations, 2 or more A1c tests per year and pneumococcal vaccinations in distressed and at-risk counties compared to competitive counties. Appalachian counties as a whole were similar to non-Appalachian counties in the uptake of all recommendations with the absolute differences of ‚â§3%.

Infection with HIV-1, male gender and older age all increase risk for KS. However, the geographic distribution of HHV-8 and KS both prior to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and with HIV/AIDS suggest the presence of an additional co-factor in the development of KS. Methods Between January 1994 and October 1997, we interviewed 2576 black in-patients with cancer in Johannesburg and Soweto, South Africa. Blood was tested for antibodies against HIV-1 and HHV-8 and the study was restricted to 2191 HIV-1 negative patients. Antibodies against the latent nuclear antigen of HHV-8 encoded by orf73 were detected with an indirect immunofluorescence assay. We examined the relationship between high anti-HHV-8 antibody titers (‚â•1:51,200) and sociodemographic and behavioral factors using unconditional logistic regression models. Variables that were significant at p = 0.10 were included in multivariate analysis. Results Of the 2191 HIV-1 negative patients who did not have Kaposi's sarcoma, 854 (39.0%) were positive for antibodies against HHV-8 according to the immunofluorescent assay. Among those seropositive for HHV-8, 530 (62.1%) had low titers (1:200), 227 (26.6%) had medium titers (1:51,200) and 97 (11.4%) had highest titers (1:204,800). Among the 2191 HIV-1 negative patients, the prevalence of high anti-HHV-8 antibody titers (‚â•1:51,200) was independently associated with increasing age (ptrend = 0.04), having a marital status of separated or divorced (p = 0.003), using wood, coal or charcoal as fuel for cooking 20 years ago instead of electricity (p = 0.02) and consuming traditional maize beer more than one time a week (p = 0.02; p-trend for increasing consumption = 0.05) although this may be due to chance given the large number of predictors considered in this analysis. Conclusions Among HIV-negative subjects, patients with high anti-HHV-8 antibody titers are characterized by older age. Other associations that may be factors in the development of high anti-HHV-8 titers include exposure to poverty or a low socioeconomic status environment and consumption of traditional maize beer. The relationship between these variables and high anti-HHV-8 titers requires further, prospective study.",BMC infectious diseases,IMMUN

Through automated routines, this technology acquires large datasets of fluorescence images depicting functional states of thousands to millions of cells. Information on shapes, textures, intensities, and localizations is then used to create unique representations, or ‚Äúphenotypic signatures,‚Äù of each cell. These signatures quantify physiologic or diseased states, for example, dendritic arborization, drug response, or cell coping strategies. Live-cell imaging in HCS adds the ability to correlate cellular events at different points in times, thereby allowing sensitivities and observations not possible with fixed endpoint analysis. HCS with live-cell imaging therefore provides unprecedented capability to detect spatiotemporal changes in cells and is particularly suited for time-dependent, stochastic processes such as neurodegenerative disorders.

Methods: Ninety patients were contacted for a phone interview [age 41.0 ¬± 10.6 (mean ¬± SD) years, age-range 31-65 years]. QoL (by SF-36) and the clinical situation (by ad hoc questionnaire) were collected. Data were analyzed with SPSS 22. SF-36 scores were compared with Italian normative data from general and healthy population. We also compared primary clinical outcomes and SF-36 scores between patients who reported high and low levels of satisfaction with BIB. Results: Considering SF-36 results, patients showed significant impairments in QoL compared to general and healthy populations. Sixty-five percent would repeat the BIB.

However, little is known in humans about the biology of CD4-CTL generation, their functional properties, and heterogeneity, especially in relation to other well-described CD4 + memory T cell subsets. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing in more than 9000 cells to unravel CD4-CTL heterogeneity, transcriptional profile, and clonality in humans. Single-cell differential gene expression analysis revealed a spectrum of known transcripts, including several linked to cytotoxic and costimulatory function that are expressed at higher levels in the T EMRA (effector memory T cells expressing CD45RA) subset, which is highly enriched for CD4-CTLs, compared with CD4 + T cells in the central memory (T CM ) and effector memory (T EM ) subsets. Simultaneous T cell antigen receptor (TCR) analysis in single cells and bulk subsets revealed that CD4-T EMRA cells show marked clonal expansion compared with T CM and T EM cells and that most of CD4-T EMRA were dengue virus (DENV)‚Äìspecific in donors with previous DENV infection. The profile of CD4-T EMRA was highly heterogeneous across donors, with four distinct clusters identified by the single-cell analysis. We identified distinct clusters of CD4-CTL effector and precursor cells in the T EMRA subset; the precursor cells shared TCR clonotypes with CD4-CTL effectors and were distinguished by high expression of the interleukin-7 receptor. Our identification of a CD4-CTL precursor population may allow further investigation of how CD4-CTLs arise in humans and, thus, could provide insights into the mechanisms that may be used to generate durable and effective CD4-CTL immunity.

Phosphorylation of PIN proteins plays an important role in generating and maintaining specific PIN polarity. In a recent study, we have shown that phosphorylation in certain conserved residues of the PIN3 hydrophilic loop (HL) modulates its subcellular localization and polarity in a cell type-specific manner in different root tissues. Here, we additionally show that the phosphorylation code of PIN3-HL is operational for the determination of PIN3 polarity in the Arabidopsis guard cell and is deciphered in a differential way even in a single tobacco cell for the intracellular trafficking of PIN3. On the other hand, PIN3 localization often remained unaltered in certain cell types irrespective of its phosphorylation status. These findings, together with previous reports, indicate that the phosphorylation code of the PIN-HL along with cell type-specific factors, kinases, and developmental/environmental cues is instrumental for the PIN trafficking to different subcellular compartments as well as different plasma membrane domains.",Plant signaling & behavior,ANIMAL
0.740528507,31077218,"HIV/AIDS length of stay in Portugal under financial constraints: a longitudinal study for public hospitals, 2009‚Äì2014","Background The global financial crisis and the economic and financial adjustment programme (EFAP) forced the Portuguese government to adopt austerity measures, which also included the health sector. The aim of this study was to analyse factors associated with HIV/AIDS patients‚Äô length of stay (LOS) among Portuguese hospitals, and the potential impact of the EFAP measures on hospitalizations among HIV/AIDS patients. Methods Data used in this analysis were collected from the Portuguese database of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG). We considered only discharges classified under MCD 24 created for patients with HIV infection. A total of 20,361 hospitalizations occurring between 2009 and 2014 in 41 public hospitals were included in the analysis. The outcome was the number of days between hospital admission and discharge dates (LOS). Hierarchical Poisson regression model with random effects was used to analyse the relation between LOS and patient, treatment and setting characteristics. To more effectively analyse the impact of the EFAP implementation on HIV/AIDS hospitalizations, yearly variables, as well as a variable measuring hospitals‚Äô financial situation (current ratio) was included. Results For the 5% level, having HIV/AIDS as the principal diagnosis, the number of secondary diagnoses, the number of procedures, and having tuberculosis have a positive impact in HIV/AIDS LOS; while being female, urgent admission, in-hospital mortality, pneumocystis pneumonia, hepatitis C, and hospital‚Äôs current ratio contribute to the decrease of LOS. Additionally, LOS between 2010 and 2014 was significantly shorter in comparison to 2009. Differences in LOS across hospitals are significant after controlling for these variables. Conclusion Following the EFAP, a number of cost-containment measures in the health sector were implemented. Results from our analysis suggest that the implementation of these measures contributed to a significant decrease is LOS among HIV/AIDS patients in Portuguese hospitals.",BMC health services research,EPIDEM
0.599786257,30323914,Alterations in electrophysiological indices of perceptual processing and discrimination are associated with co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder,"Background Many young people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience emotional and behavioural problems. However, the causes of these co-occurring difficulties are not well understood. Perceptual processing atypicalities are also often reported in individuals with ASD, but how these relate to co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems remains unclear, and few studies have used objective measurement of perceptual processing. Methods Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to both standard and deviant stimuli (which varied in pitch) in an auditory oddball paradigm in adolescents (mean age of 13.56¬†years, SD‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.12, range‚Äâ=‚Äâ11.40‚Äì15.70) with ASD ( n =‚Äâ43) with a wide range of IQ (mean IQ of 84.14, SD‚Äâ=‚Äâ24.24, range 27‚Äì129). Response to deviant as compared to standard stimuli (as indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN)) and response to repeated presentations of standard stimuli (habituation) were measured. Multivariate regression tested the association between neural indices of perceptual processing and co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems. Results Greater sensitivity to changes in pitch in incoming auditory information (discrimination), as indexed by increased MMN amplitude, was associated with higher levels of parent-rated behaviour problems. MMN amplitude also showed a trend positive correlation with parent-rated sensory hyper-sensitivity. Conversely, greater habituation at the later N2 component was associated with higher levels of emotional problems. Upon more detailed analyses, this appeared to be driven by a selectively greater ERP response to the first (but not the second or third) standard stimuli that followed deviant stimuli. A similar pattern of association was found with other measures of anxiety. All results remained in covariation analyses controlling for age, sex and IQ, although the association between MMN amplitude and behaviour problems became non-significant when controlling for ASD severity. Conclusions Findings suggest that alterations in mechanisms of perceptual processing and discrimination may be important for understanding co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems in young people with ASD.

0.103275085,28119668,"PprM, a Cold Shock Domain-Containing Protein from  Deinococcus radiodurans , Confers Oxidative Stress Tolerance to  Escherichia coli","Escherichia coli is a representative microorganism that is frequently used for industrial biotechnology; thus its cellular robustness should be enhanced for the widespread application of E. coli in biotechnology. Stress response genes from the extremely radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans have been used to enhance the stress tolerance of E. coli . In the present study, we introduced the cold shock domain-containing protein PprM from D. radiodurans into E. coli and observed that the tolerance to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) was significantly increased in recombinant strains (Ec-PprM). The overexpression of PprM in E. coli elevated the expression of some OxyR-dependent genes, which play important roles in oxidative stress tolerance. Particularly, mntH (manganese transporter) was activated by 9-fold in Ec-PprM, even in the absence of H 2 O 2 stress, which induced a more than 2-fold increase in the Mn/Fe ratio compared with wild type. The reduced production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (¬∑OH) and low protein carbonylation levels (a marker of oxidative damage) in Ec-PprM indicate that the increase in the Mn/Fe ratio contributes to the protection of cells from H 2 O 2 stress. PprM also conferred H 2 O 2 tolerance to E. coli in the absence of OxyR. We confirmed that the H 2 O 2 tolerance of oxyR mutants reflected the activation of the ycgZ - ymgABC operon, whose expression is activated by H 2 O 2 in an OxyR-independent manner. Thus, the results of the present study showed that PprM could be exploited to improve the robustness of E. coli .",Frontiers in microbiology,BIOCHEM
0.87199765,23355462,Computerized provider documentation: findings and implications of a multisite study of clinicians and administrators,"Objective Clinical documentation is central to the medical record and so to a range of healthcare and business processes. As electronic health record adoption expands, computerized provider documentation (CPD) is increasingly the primary means of capturing clinical documentation. Previous CPD studies have focused on particular stakeholder groups and sites, often limiting their scope and conclusions. To address this, we studied multiple stakeholder groups from multiple sites across the USA. Methods We conducted 14 focus groups at five Department of Veterans Affairs facilities with 129 participants (54 physicians or practitioners, 34 nurses, and 37 administrators). Investigators qualitatively analyzed resultant transcripts, developed categories linked to the data, and identified emergent themes. Results Five major themes related to CPD emerged: communication and coordination; control and limitations in expressivity; information availability and reasoning support; workflow alteration and disruption; and trust and confidence concerns. The results highlight that documentation intertwines tightly with clinical and administrative workflow. Perceptions differed between the three stakeholder groups but remained consistent within groups across facilities. Conclusions CPD has dramatically changed documentation processes, impacting clinical understanding, decision-making, and communication across multiple groups. The need for easy and rapid, yet structured and constrained, documentation often conflicts with the need for highly reliable and retrievable information to support clinical reasoning and workflows. Current CPD systems, while better than paper overall, often do not meet the needs of users, partly because they are based on an outdated ‚Äòpaper-chart‚Äô paradigm. These findings should inform those implementing CPD systems now and future plans for more effective CPD systems.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,CS
0.007885883,23034518,Role of Fusiform and Anterior Temporal Cortical Areas in Facial Recognition," Recent FMRI studies suggest that cortical face processing extends well beyond the fusiform face area (FFA), including unspecified portions of the anterior temporal lobe. However, the exact location of such anterior temporal region(s), and their role during active face recognition, remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that (in addition to FFA) a small bilateral site in the anterior tip of the collateral sulcus (‚ÄòAT‚Äô; the anterior temporal face patch) is selectively activated during recognition of faces but not houses (a non-face object). In contrast to the psychophysical prediction that inverted and contrast reversed faces are processed like other non-face objects, both FFA and AT (but not other visual areas) were also activated during recognition of inverted and contrast reversed faces. However, response accuracy was better correlated to recognition-driven activity in AT, compared to FFA. These data support a segregated, hierarchical model of face recognition processing, extending to the anterior temporal cortex. ",NeuroImage,NEURO
0.248317779,26954783,An Efficacious Multi-Objective Fuzzy Linear Programming Approach for Optimal Power Flow Considering Distributed Generation,"This paper proposes a new formulation for the multi-objective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problem for meshed power networks considering distributed generation. An efficacious multi-objective fuzzy linear programming optimization (MFLP) algorithm is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem with and without considering the distributed generation (DG) effect. A variant combination of objectives is considered for simultaneous optimization, including power loss, voltage stability, and shunt capacitors MVAR reserve. Fuzzy membership functions for these objectives are designed with extreme targets, whereas the inequality constraints are treated as hard constraints. The multi-objective fuzzy optimal power flow (OPF) formulation was converted into a crisp OPF in a successive linear programming (SLP) framework and solved using an efficient interior point method (IPM). To test the efficacy of the proposed approach, simulations are performed on the IEEE 30-busand IEEE 118-bus test systems. The MFLP optimization is solved for several optimization cases. The obtained results are compared with those presented in the literature. A unique solution with a high satisfaction for the assigned targets is gained. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MFLP technique in terms of solution optimality and rapid convergence. Moreover, the results indicate that using the optimal DG location with the MFLP algorithm provides the solution with the highest quality.",PloS one,CS

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published report of PCB11 in ambient air. This compound is ubiquitous in air throughout the city of Chicago. The annual mean concentration in air samples collected from November 2006 to November 2007 is 24 pg m ‚àí3 (¬± 24 pg m ‚àí3 std. dev.), although the seasonal variation is significant. The concentration of PCB11 is up to 15% of measured polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in air but only up to 0.16% of commercial Aroclor mixtures that were banned from production in the 1970s. PCB11 is associated with pigments, paints, and resins and has been reported to be a dominant congener among PCBs detected in the wastewater effluent from paint production. The wide distribution of PCB11 in Chicago air is consistent with volatilization of this compound from painted surfaces although the actual source of PCB11 is unknown.

0.70202039,29720986,"A Nitrogen Molecular Sensing System, Comprised of the  ALLANTOINASE  and  UREIDE PERMEASE 1  Genes, Can Be Used to Monitor N Status in Rice","Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development, but its concentration in the soil is often insufficient for optimal crop production. Consequently, improving N utilization in crops is considered as a major target in agricultural biotechnology. However, much remains to be learnt about crop N metabolism for application. In this study, we have developed a molecular sensor system to monitor the N status in rice ( Oryza sativa ). We first examined the role of the ureide, allantoin, which is catabolized into allantoin-derived metabolites and used as an N source under low N conditions. The expression levels of two genes involved in ureide metabolism, ALLANTOINASE ( OsALN ) and UREIDE PERMEASE 1 ( OsUPS1 ), were highly responsive to the N status. OsALN was rapidly up-regulated under low N conditions, whereas OsUPS1 was up-regulated under high N conditions. Taking advantage of the responses of these two genes to N status, we generated transgenic rice plants harboring the molecular N sensors, proALN::ALN-LUC2 and proUPS1::UPS1-LUC2 , comprising the gene promoters driving expression of the luciferase reporter. We observed that expression of the transgenes mimicked transcriptional regulation of the endogenous OsALN and OsUPS1 genes in response to exogenous N status. Importantly, the molecular N sensors showed similar levels of specificity to nitrate and ammonium, from which we infer their sensing abilities. Transgenic rice plants expressing the proUPS1::UPS1-LUC2 sensor showed strong luminescence under high exogenous N conditions (>1 mM), whereas transgenic plants expressing the proALN::ALN-LUC2 sensor showed strong luminescence under low exogenous N conditions (<0.1 mM). High exogenous N (>1 mM) substantially increased internal ammonium and nitrate levels, whereas low exogenous N (<0.1 mM) had no effect on internal ammonium and nitrate levels, indicating the luminescence signals of molecular sensors reflect internal N status in rice. Thus, proALN::ALN-LUC2 and proUPS1::UPS1-LUC2 represent N molecular sensors that operate over a physiological and developmental range in rice.",Frontiers in plant science,ANIMAL
0.881587816,24119145,"Transcriptional profile of  Paracoccidioides  induced by oenothein B, a potential antifungal agent from the Brazilian Cerrado plant  Eugenia uniflora","Background The compound oenothein B (OenB), which is isolated from the leaves of Eugenia uniflora , a Brazilian Cerrado plant, interferes with Paracoccidioides yeast cell morphology and inhibits 1,3-Œ≤-D-glucan synthase ( Pb FKS1) transcript accumulation, which is involved in cell wall synthesis. In this work we examined the gene expression changes in Paracoccidioides yeast cells following OenB treatment in order to investigate the adaptive cellular responses to drug stress. Results We constructed differential gene expression libraries using Representational Difference Analysis (RDA) of Paracoccidioides yeast cells treated with OenB for 90 and 180¬†min. Treatment for 90¬†min resulted in the identification of 463 up-regulated expressed sequences tags (ESTs) and 104 down-regulated ESTs. For the 180¬†min treatment 301 up-regulated ESTs and 143 down-regulated were identified. Genes involved in the cell wall biosynthesis, such as GLN1, KRE6 and FKS1, were found to be regulated by OenB. Infection experiments in macrophages corroborated the in vitro results. Fluorescence microscopy showed increased levels of chitin in cells treated with OenB. The carbohydrate polymer content of the cell wall of the fungus was also evaluated, and the results corroborated with the transcriptional data. Several other genes, such as those involved in a variety of important cellular processes (i.e., membrane maintenance, stress and virulence) were found to be up-regulated in response to OenB treatment. Conclusions The exposure of Paracoccidioides to OenB resulted in a complex altered gene expression profile. Some of the changes may represent specific adaptive responses to this compound in this important pathogenic fungus.",BMC microbiology,BIOCHEM

0.044174882,15883196,"Kinesin-1 mediates translocation of the meiotic spindle to the oocyte cortex through KCA-1, a novel cargo adapter","In animals, female meiotic spindles are attached to the egg cortex in a perpendicular orientation at anaphase to allow the selective disposal of three haploid chromosome sets into polar bodies. We have identified a complex of interacting Caenorhabditis elegans proteins that are involved in the earliest step in asymmetric positioning of anastral meiotic spindles, translocation to the cortex. This complex is composed of the kinesin-1 heavy chain orthologue, UNC-116, the kinesin light chain orthologues, KLC-1 and -2, and a novel cargo adaptor, KCA-1. Depletion of any of these subunits by RNA interference resulted in meiosis I metaphase spindles that remained stationary at a position several micrometers from the cell cortex during the time when wild-type spindles translocated to the cortex. After this prolonged stationary period, unc-116(RNAi) spindles moved to the cortex through a partially redundant mechanism that is dependent on the anaphase-promoting complex. This study thus reveals two sequential mechanisms for translocating anastral spindles to the oocyte cortex.",The Journal of cell biology,BIOCHEM

Design Observational study. Setting Hospitals (n=1487) participating in the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke program in the United States, from 2009 to 2011. Participants 12‚Äâ552 warfarin naive atrial fibrillation patients admitted to hospital for ischemic stroke and treated with warfarin compared with no oral anticoagulant at discharge, linked to Medicare claims for longitudinal outcomes. Main outcome measures Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and home time, a patient centered outcomes measure defined as the total number of days free from institutional care after discharge. A propensity score inverse probability weighting method was used to account for all differences in observed characteristics between treatment groups. Results Among 12‚Äâ552 survivors of stroke, 11‚Äâ039 (88%) were treated with warfarin at discharge. Warfarin treated patients were slightly younger and less likely to have a history of previous stroke or coronary artery disease but had similar severity of stroke as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Relative to those not treated, patients treated with warfarin had more days at home (as opposed to institutional care) during the two years after discharge (adjusted home time difference 47.6 days, 99% confidence interval 26.9 to 68.2). Patients discharged on warfarin treatment also had a reduced risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio 0.87, 99% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.98), all cause mortality (0.72, 0.63 to 0.84), and recurrent ischemic stroke (0.63, 0.48 to 0.83). These differences were consistent among clinically relevant subgroups by age, sex, stroke severity, and history of previous coronary artery disease and stroke.

Children with KD (n=152) were classified into 7 groups according to fever duration: at the third day or earlier (n=20), fourth (n=33), fifth (n=46), sixth (n=15), seventh (n=15), eighth (n=9), and at the ninth day or later after fever onset (n= 14). The levels of various laboratory indices were determined 3 times: before, 24 hr and 7 days after intravenous immunoglobulin administration (2 g/kg). WBC and neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein level were the highest at the sixth day. Levels of hemoglobin, albumin, and high density lipoprotein cholestrol were the lowest at the sixth day. Although these indices were not significant statistically between groups, the indices showed either bell-shaped or U-shaped distribution of which peak or trench were at the sixth day. These findiugs showed that the inflammatory processes in KD reach peak on the sixth day of fever onset.

0.056614174,17122856,Polo Kinase Controls Cell Cycle-Dependent Transcription by Direct Targeting of a Coactivator Protein," Polo kinases play crucial conserved roles in controlling the eukaryotic cell cycle through orchestrating several events during mitosis 1 , 2 . An essential element of cell cycle control is exerted by altering the expression of key regulators 3 . Here, we demonstrate an important role for the polo kinase, Cdc5p, in controlling cell cycle-dependent gene expression which is critical for the execution of mitosis in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae . In particular, we find that Cdc5p is temporally recruited to promoters of the cell cycle-regulated CLB2 gene cluster, where it targets the Mcm1p-Fkh2p-Ndd1p transcription factor complex, through direct phosphorylation of the coactivator protein Ndd1p. This phosphorylation event is required for the normal temporal expression of cell cycle-regulated genes such as CLB2 and SWI5 in G2/M phases. Furthermore, severe defects in cell division occur in the absence of Cdc5p-mediated phosphorylation of Ndd1p. Thus, polo kinase is required for the production of key mitotic regulators, in addition to previously defined roles in controlling other mitotic events. ",Nature,BIOCHEM
0.344031556,28123798,Meta-analysis reveals protective effects of vitamin B on stroke patients,"Stroke is the loss of brain function due to a disturbance in the blood supply to the brain resulting from either ischemia or hemorrhage. Previous studies have evaluated the clinical importance of nutritional interventions such as vitamin B supplementation in the management of acute strokes. However, it is still inconclusive whether or not vitamin B supplementation will benefit patients with acute strokes. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of vitamin B supplementation in the treatment of stroke patients. Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched (from 1960 to June 2015) and forest plots were generated to illustrate the treatment effects. A systemic review of the electronic databases yielded 12 eligible studies consisting of 7474 patients. Forest plots from the meta-analyses of the included studies illustrated that vitamin B supplementation significantly lowered the plasma concentration of total homocysteine (SMD = ‚àí0.82; 95% CI: ‚àí0.77; Z = ‚àí29.06, p < 0.0001) and resulted in significant reduction in stroke recurrence (OR = 0.86%; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.97; Z = ‚àí2.41; p = 0.016) as well as a combined incidence of vascular events, including recurrent strokes, myocardial infarctions and vascular deaths (OR = 0.87%; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.96; Z= ‚àí2.73; p = 0.0063). Additionally, the nearly-symmetrical funnel plot (Egger‚Äôs test, t = ‚àí1.705, p = 0.1224) indicated the absence of publication bias regarding the meta-analysis that examined the effect of vitamin B supplementation on the plasma levels of homocysteine in acute stroke patients.

0.904090587,23249231,Antigen loss and tumor-mediated immunosuppression facilitate tumor recurrence," While tumor immunotherapy has seen notable success in recent years, mechanisms that tumors utilize to escape immune responses have provided significant hurdles to maximal clinical benefit. Escape mechanisms such as antigen loss, decreased MHC expression, as well as tumor-mediated suppressive effects on antitumor immune responses, can cause the most potent antitumor immune response to be rendered powerless at the tumor site. In this study, the authors show that the adoptive transfer of tumor antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells combined with tumor cell immunization can elicit regression of established subcutaneous tumors in lymphopenic, but not lymphoreplete, animals. However, using a suboptimal dose of transferred cells followed by vaccination, the authors identify the development of recurrent tumors with reduced antigen expression. These tumors could still be eradicated in similarly treated animals; however, they found that transferred CD4 + T cells from animals with recurrent tumors acquired a suppressive phenotype. This work highlights the importance of understanding mechanisms of tumor escape, particularly underscoring the role of the tumor in modulating antigen-specific immune responses, and the critical importance of finding mechanisms to avoid the development of viable escape variants.

We sought to describe the changes in a diverse set of plasma metabolite profiles in patients undergoing chronic exercise training and assess the relationship between metabolites and cardiometabolic response to exercise.    Methods  secondary analysis was performed in 216 middle-aged abdominally obese men and women ([mean (SD)], 52.4 (8.0) years) randomized into one of four groups varying in exercise amount and intensity for 6 months duration: high amount high intensity, high amount low intensity, low amount low intensity, and control. 147 metabolites were profiled by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.    Results  No significant differences in metabolite changes between specific exercise groups were observed; therefore, subsequent analyses were collapsed across exercise groups. There were no significant differences in metabolite changes between the exercise and control groups after 24 weeks at a Bonferroni-adjusted statistical significance (p < 3.0 √ó 10 -4 ). Seven metabolites changed in the exercise group compared to the control group at p < 0.05. Changes in several metabolites from distinct metabolic pathways were associated with change in cardiometabolic risk traits, and three baseline metabolite levels predicted changes in cardiometabolic risk traits.    Conclusion  Metabolomic profiling revealed no significant plasma metabolite changes between exercise compared to control after 24-weeks at Bonferroni significance. However, we identified circulating biomarkers that were predictive or reflective of improvements in cardiometabolic traits in the exercise group.

Early surgical treatment by performing pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) may improve symptoms. The goal of the study was to review our experience and early outcome of PEA in patients with CTED. Methods: Data were prospectively collected on all patients who underwent PEA between 2011 and 2015. Patients with CTED and a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of <25 mm Hg were identified. All patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III. Measured outcomes were in-hospital complications, improvement in cardiac function and exercise capacity, and survival after PEA. Patients were reassessed at 6 months following surgery. Results: A total of 23 patients underwent surgery. There was no in-hospital mortality, but complications occurred in six patients (26%). At 6 months following surgery, 93% of the patients remained alive. Following PEA, the mPAP fell significantly from 21.0¬±2.7 mm Hg to 18.2¬±5.5 mm Hg (p<.001). Pulmonary vascular resistance also significantly decreased from 2.2¬±0.7 wood to 1.5¬±0.5 wood (p<.001). The 6-min walking distance significantly increased from 322.6¬±80.4 m to 379.9¬±68.2 m (p<.001). There was a significant symptomatic improvement in all survivors in NYHA functional classes I or II at 6 months following surgery (p=.001).

Here, we examined the antiviral and anti-bacterial responses of single CD8+ T cells from the polyclonal repertoire. The progeny of na√Øve clonal CD8+ T cells displayed unique profiles of differentiation based on extrinsic pathogen-induced environmental cues, with some clones demonstrating extreme bias towards a single developmental pathway. Moreover, even within the same animal, a single na√Øve CD8 + + T cell exhibited distinct fates that were controlled by tissue-specific events. However, memory CD8+ T cells relied on intrinsic factors to control differentiation upon challenge.

0.004656119,29721347,Endoscopic surgery via a combined frontal and suboccipital approach for cerebellar hemorrhage,"Background: Spontaneous cerebellar hemorrhages (CHs), which frequently require surgical intervention, are life-threatening and can be complicated by intraventricular hemorrhages (IVHs) and obstructive hydrocephalus. Commonly, endoscopic surgery is performed to remove CHs via a suboccipital approach (SA) alone. At our institution, when patients exhibited supratentorial IVH-associated hydrocephalus, we used a combined frontal and suboccipital approach (CA) to evacuate both CHs and supratentorial IVHs. The present study retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness and safety of this CA, as no prior studies examining this approach currently exist. Methods: Twenty-six patients with spontaneous CH were surgically treated at our hospital from April 2009 to March 2016. Twenty-two patients who could independently perform activities of daily living before the onset underwent endoscopic surgery to evacuate the CHs; among these, 13 patients underwent the SA alone, while nine underwent the CA. We assessed and compared the patients‚Äô baseline characteristics, surgical results, and prognosis at 1 month after the intervention between the SA and CA groups. Results: Patients who underwent the CA had significantly poorer consciousness before the surgery owing to IVH extension and obstructive hydrocephalus. However, the surgical results and prognosis at 1 month were not significantly different between the two approaches. The CH-associated IVHs were successfully removed with the CA and resulted in shorter external ventricular drainage (EVD) placement durations. Conclusion: Endoscopic surgery performed via the CA appeared to neutralize the deteriorating effects of CH-associated IVHs. Surgical strategies employing the CA may have the potential to improve the prognosis of patients with CH.",Surgical neurology international,CLINIC
0.651968837,22446492,Measuring and comparing brain cortical surface area and other areal quantities," Structural analysis of MRI data on the cortical surface usually focuses on cortical thickness. Cortical surface area, when considered, has been measured only over gross regions or approached indirectly via comparisons with a standard brain. Here we demonstrate that direct measurement and comparison of the surface area of the cerebral cortex at a fine scale is possible using mass conservative interpolation methods. We present a framework for analyses of the cortical surface area, as well as for any other measurement distributed across the cortex that is areal by nature. The method consists of the construction of a mesh representation of the ortex, registration to a common coordinate system and, crucially, interpolation using a pycnophylactic method. Statistical analysis of surface area is done with power-transformed data to address lognormality, and inference is done with permutation methods. We introduce the concept of facewise analysis, discuss its interpretation and potential applications. ",NeuroImage,NEURO
0.682351716,30463012,Activation of miR-21-Regulated Pathways in Immune Aging Selects against Signatures Characteristic of Memory T Cells," SUMMARY  Induction of protective vaccine responses, governed by the successful generation of antigen-specific anti-bodies and long-lived memory T cells, is increasingly impaired with age. Regulation of the T cell proteome by a dynamic network of microRNAs is crucial to T cell responses. Here, we show that activation-induced upregulation of miR-21 biases the transcrip-tome of differentiating T cells away from memory T cells and toward inflammatory effector T cells. Such a transcriptome bias is also characteristic of T cell responses in older individuals who have increased miR-21 expression and is reversed by antagonizing miR-21. miR-21 targets negative feedback circuits in several signaling pathways. The concerted, sustained activity of these signaling path-ways in miR-21 high T cells disfavors the induction of transcription factor networks involved in memory cell differentiation. Our data suggest that curbing miR-21 upregulation or activity in older individuals may improve their ability to mount effective vaccine responses.   Graphical Abstract      In Brief  A hallmark of the aging immune system is its failure to induce long-lived memory. Kim et al. report that increased expression of miR-21 in naive T cells from older individuals sustains signaling in the MAPK and AKT-mTORC pathways, disfavoring induction of transcription factor networks involved in memory cell generation.

0.508272262,17241141,Disentangling gaze shifts from preparatory ERP effects during spatial attention," After a cue directing attention to one side, anterior event-related potentials (ERPs) show contralateral negativity (Anterior Directing Attention Negativity, ADAN). It is unclear whether ADAN effects are contaminated by contralateral negativity arising from residual gaze shifts. Conversely, it is possible that ADAN-related potentials contaminate the horizontal electrooculogram (HEOG), via volume conduction. To evaluate these possibilities, we used high-resolution infrared eye tracking, while recording EEG and HEOG in a cued spatial-attention task. We found that, after conventional ERP and HEOG pre-processing exclusions, small but systematic residual gaze shifts in the cued direction can remain, as revealed by the infrared measure. Nevertheless, by using this measure for more stringent exclusion of small gaze shifts, we confirmed that reliable ADAN components remain for preparatory spatial attention in the absence of any systematic gaze shifts toward the cued side.

0.347245653,25679365,Patterns of substance use initiation among Indigenous adolescents ‚òÜ,"  Background  The data for this study come from an eight-wave panel study of Indigenous (Canadian First Nations and American Indian) adolescents from three U.S. reservations and four Canadian reserves.    Objectives  Our objective was to investigate variations in patterns of substance use initiation from early adolescence through early adulthood using data collected annually for 8 years.    Method  At baseline the sample included 675 Indigenous adolescents ( M age = 11.10, SD = .83; 50.3% girls). First, we calculated cumulative rates of substance use initiation by age. We then examined whether the cumulative initiation rates were moderated by gender using logistic regression analyses. Second, we calculated hazard rates for substance use initiation by age. Third, we focused on the ordering of two substances, paired two substances, and three substance initiation sequences.    Results  If one looks only at the cumulative rates of substance use initiation there appears to be support for a sequential progression of substance use during early adolescence. In contrast to the cumulative rates of substance use initiation, the hazard analyses showed a much more mixed, less progressive sequence. Among two substance pairings a nicotine to marijuana initiation sequence was most likely, followed by a nicotine to alcohol sequence. An alcohol to marijuana sequence was nearly twice as likely as a marijuana to alcohol sequence. Refined analyses to conform to those of many of the traditional gateway studies by introducing paired two substance orderings indicated that nicotine and/or alcohol prior to marijuana use was by far the most likely sequence. In two of the three most likely three substance sequences (nicotine to alcohol to marijuana and nicotine to marijuana to alcohol) nicotine was the first substance initiated.    Conclusion  This study refines the gateway hypothesis for Indigenous adolescents by providing an in-depth analysis of substance use initiation. The only evidence for a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù substance that emerged in our analyses was for nicotine use which was likely to precede alcohol and marijuana use in both two-substance pairings and to a lesser extent in three-substance initiation sequences.

0.905081245,19449186,A frameshift mutation of the chloroplast  mat K coding region is associated with chlorophyll deficiency in the  Cryptomeria japonica  virescent mutant  Wogon -Sugi,"Wogon -Sugi has been reported as a cytoplasmically inherited virescent mutant selected from a horticultural variety of Cryptomeria japonica . Although previous studies of plastid structure and inheritance indicated that at least some mutations are encoded by the chloroplast genome, the causative gene responsible for the primary chlorophyll deficiency in Wogon -Sugi, has not been identified. In this study, we identified this gene by genomic sequencing of chloroplast DNA and genetic analysis. Chloroplast DNA sequencing of 16 wild-type and 16 Wogon -Sugi plants showed a 19-bp insertional sequence in the mat K coding region in the Wogon -Sugi. This insertion disrupted the mat K reading frame. Although an indel mutation in the ycf 1 and ycf 2 coding region was detected in Wogon -Sugi, sequence variations similar to that of Wogon -Sugi were also detected in several wild-type lines, and they maintained the reading frame. Genetic analysis of the 19¬†bp insertional mutation in the mat K coding region showed that it was found only in the chlorophyll-deficient sector of 125 full-sibling seedlings. Therefore, the 19-bp insertion in the mat K coding region is the most likely candidate at present for a mutation underlying the Wogon -Sugi phenotype.

To help researchers decide which algorithm to use, we developed the analysis of gene ranking algorithms (AGRA) system that offers a novel technique for comparing ranked lists of genes. The most important feature of AGRA is that no previous knowledge of gene ranking algorithms is needed for their comparison. Using the text mining system finding-associated concepts with text analysis. AGRA defines what we call biomedical concept space (BCS) for each gene list and offers a comparison of the gene lists in six different BCS categories. The uploaded gene lists can be compared using two different methods. In the first method, the overlap between each pair of two gene lists of BCSs is calculated. The second method offers a text field where a specific biomedical concept can be entered. AGRA searches for this concept in each gene lists' BCS, highlights the rank of the concept and offers a visual representation of concepts ranked above and below it.

The laccase activity was enhanced by Cu+2, Zn+2 and Mn+2. In addition, the dye decolorization potential of purified laccase was much higher in terms of extent as well as time. The purified laccase decolorized (96%) of anthraquinonic dye Reactive blue- 4 within 4 h and its biodegradation studies was monitored by UV visible spectra, FTIR and HPLC which concluded that cyanobacterial laccase can be efficiently used to decolorize synthetic dye and help in waste water treatment.",PloS one,ENG
0.023701045,17634449,Genomewide Association Analysis of Coronary Artery Disease,"  BACKGROUND  Modern genotyping platforms permit a systematic search for inherited components of complex diseases. We performed a joint analysis of two genomewide association studies of coronary artery disease.    METHODS  We first identified chromosomal loci that were strongly associated with coronary artery disease in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study (which involved 1926 case subjects with coronary artery disease and 2938 controls) and looked for replication in the German MI [Myocardial Infarction] Family Study (which involved 875 case subjects with myocardial infarction and 1644 controls). Data on other single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly associated with coronary artery disease in either study (P<0.001) were then combined to identify additional loci with a high probability of true association. Genotyping in both studies was performed with the use of the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set (Affymetrix).    RESULTS  Of thousands of chromosomal loci studied, the same locus had the strongest association with coronary artery disease in both the WTCCC and the German studies: chromosome 9p21.3 (SNP, rs1333049) (P=1.80√ó10 ‚àí14 and P=3.40√ó10 ‚àí6 , respectively). Overall, the WTCCC study revealed nine loci that were strongly associated with coronary artery disease (P<1.2√ó10 ‚àí5 and less than a 50% chance of being falsely positive). In addition to chromosome 9p21.3, two of these loci were successfully replicated (adjusted P<0.05) in the German study: chromosome 6q25.1 (rs6922269) and chromosome 2q36.3 (rs2943634). The combined analysis of the two studies identified four additional loci significantly associated with coronary artery disease (P<1.3√ó10 ‚àí6 ) and a high probability (>80%) of a true association: chromosomes 1p13.3 (rs599839), 1q41 (rs17465637), 10q11.21 (rs501120), and 15q22.33 (rs17228212).

0.856361864,31067461,Endothelial Cells in the Decidual Bed Are Potential Therapeutic Targets for Preterm Birth Prevention," SUMMARY  Preterm birth (PTB) is a syndrome with many origins. Among them, infection or inflammation are major risk factors for PTB; however, local defense mechanisms to mount anti-inflammatory responses against inflammation-induced PTB are poorly understood. Here, we show that endothelial TLR4 in the decidual bed is critical for sensing inflammation during pregnancy because mice with endothelial Tlr4 deletion are resistant to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PTB. Under inflammatory conditions, IL-6 is readily expressed in decidual endothelial cells with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) phosphorylation in perivascular stromal cells, which then regulates expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Our observation that administration of an IL-10 neutralizing antibody predisposing mice to PTB shows IL-10‚Äôs anti-inflammatory role to prevent PTB. We show that the integration of endothelial and perivascular stromal signaling can determine pregnancy outcomes. These findings highlight a role for endothelial TLR4 in inflammation-induced PTB and may offer a potential therapeutic target to prevent PTB.   Graphical Abstract      In Brief  Deng et al. show a balance between inflammation and anti-inflammation involving endothelial and decidual cells in pregnancy. Tipping this balance toward inflammation contributes to preterm birth. A mechanism to preserve homeostatic balance in pregnancy under inflammation is mediated by a cross-talk between endothelial and perivascular stromal cells. ",Cell reports,BIOCHEM

Thus the rare species may have reduced capacity to adapt to future climate changes. Abstract Climate change is compounding the threats to the future of biodiversity, already impacted by habitat loss, invasive species and diseases. In the Hawaiian Islands, many of the endemic species have narrow habitat ranges that make them especially vulnerable to climate change. The Hawaiian Drosophila , a remarkably diverse group of species with 11 listed as federally endangered, are thought to be sensitive to temperature changes. To examine the species differences in sensitivity of Hawaiian picture-wing Drosophila to temperature changes, wild populations of Drosophila sproati , a relatively common species, and Drosophila silvestris , a rare species, were collected from two locations on Hawaii Island and bred in common laboratory conditions. Adult flies were exposed to hot and cold temperatures and compared with adult flies at control temperatures. Drosophila silvestris adults were less tolerant to heat stress than D. sproati for both survival and sperm mobility. In contrast, D. silvestris adults were more tolerant to cold stress than D. sproati for adult survival. The expression of 4950 Gene Ontology annotated gene transcripts was also analysed in high-temperature-treated and control males to identify candidate genes related to heat tolerance. There were more than twice as many transcripts differentially expressed after high temperature treatment for D. silvestris (246 transcripts) as for D. sproati (106 transcripts), with 13 Gene Ontology terms enriched between temperatures for D. silvestris and merely three in D. sproati. The combined results are consistent with D. sproati occurring more widely today as well as occurring at lower elevations than D. silvestris and with a genetically based temperature response, which is more severe in D. silvestris at high temperatures than that in D. sproati . These experiments demonstrate the potential for different capacities of species to adapt to future climate change conditions as well as providing an explanation for historical changes in the distribution of species.",Conservation physiology,ECO

It is a biocompatible, cheap, environmentally friendly and readily accessible material. It has been reported that these biomacromolecules have antimicrobial activities. Consequently, lignin (LIG) has the potential to be used for biomedical applications. In the present work, a simple method to prepare lignin-based hydrogels is described. The hydrogels were prepared by combining LIG with poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(methyl vinyl ether- co -maleic acid) through an esterification reaction. The synthesis took place in the solid state and can be accelerated significantly (24 vs 1 h) by the use of microwave (MW) radiation. The prepared hydrogels were characterized by evaluation of their swelling capacities and with the use of infrared spectroscopy/solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. The prepared hydrogels showed LIG contents ranging between 40% and 24% and water uptake capabilities up to 500%. Furthermore, the hydrophobic nature of LIG facilitated loading of a model hydrophobic drug (curcumin). The hydrogels were capable of sustaining the delivery of this compound for up to 4 days. Finally, the materials demonstrated logarithmic reductions in adherence of Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis of up to 5.0 relative to the commonly employed medical material poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC).

Here, we conducted a genome-wide investigation to study whether the molecular mechanisms involved in these traits were affected by local adaptation. Methods We performed a polygenic risk score analysis in a sample of 2455 individuals from 23 European populations with respect to variables related to geo-climate diversity, pathogen diversity, and language phonological complexity. The analysis was adjusted for the genetic diversity of European populations to ensure that the differences detected would reflect differences in environmental exposures. Results The top finding was related to the association between winter minimum temperature and schizophrenia. Additional significant geo-climate results were also observed with respect to bipolar disorder¬†(sunny daylight), depressive symptoms (precipitation rate), major depressive disorder (precipitation rate), and subjective well-being¬†(relative humidity). Beyond geo-climate variables, we also observed findings related to pathogen diversity and language phonological complexity: openness to experience was associated with protozoan diversity; conscientiousness and extraversion were associated with language consonants.

0.550592499,25392571,Notch Signaling May Be Involved in the Abnormal Differentiation of Epidermal Keratinocytes in Psoriasis,"Localization of each keratin isoform differs among epidermal layers. Proliferating basal cells synthesize keratin 14 (K14) and suprabasal cells express keratin 10 (K10) in normal skin. Notch signaling is essential for keratinocyte differentiation. Notch1 is expressed in all epidermal layers, Notch2 in the basal cell layer and Notch3 in basal cell and spinous cell layers in normal epidermis. It has been poorly elucidated how localization and expression levels of Notch molecules are related to epidermal molecular markers K10 and K14 in psoriatic skin with abnormal differentiation of epidermal tissue. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between abnormal differentiation of epidermal cells in psoriatic skin and expression of Notch molecules. We investigated keratins (K14 and K10) and Notches (1, 2, 3 and 4) using immunohistochemistry in psoriatic skin (n=30) and normal skin (n=10). In normal skin, K14 and K10 were discretely observed in the basal cell layer and suprabasal layer, respectively. In psoriatic skin, K14 was expressed in the pan epidermal layer while it and K10 were co-expressed in some middle suprabasal layer cells. Notch1, 2, 3, and 4 localized in all epidermal layers in normal skin. In psoriatic skin, Notch1, 2, and 4 mainly localized in suprabasilar layers and Notch3 is lacalized in pan epidermal, suprabasilar, and basilar layers. Protein and mRNA of Notch1, 2, and 3 isoforms decreased in psoriatic epidermis compared with normal epidermis. These data suggest that decrements in these Notch molecules might cause aberrant expression of K10 and K14 leading to anomalous differentiation of the epidermis in psoriatic lesions.",Acta histochemica et cytochemica,BIOCHEM

Exosomes are lipid bilayer-bound microvesicles containing various macromolecules including numerous microRNA (miRNA). Exosomes mediate intercellular communication by fusing and releasing their macromolecular content into target cells. Here, we analysed the content of profibrotic and antifibrotic miRNAs in exosomes isolated from the serum of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients and tested their ability to induce a profibrotic pheno-type in normal human dermal fibroblasts in vitro.    Methods.  Exosomes were isolated from serum from patients with limited cutaneous or diffuse cutaneous SSc and were characterised by Nanosight Particle Tracking Analysis, exosome antibody arrays, and transmission electron microscopy. The content of nine profibrotic and eighteen antifibrotic miRNA was assessed in the isolated exosomes by semiquantitative real time PCR. The effects of the isolated exosomes on cultured normal human dermal fibroblasts were assessed by real time PCR and Western blotting.    Results.  The isolated serum exosomes displayed the expected exosome size and morphology and contained characteristic exosome proteins. Six profibrotic miRNAs were increased and ten antifibrotic miRNAs were decreased in SSc serum exosomes compared to normal serum exosomes. The levels of eight miRNA were significantly different between exosomes from limited and diffuse SSc. Exosomes isolated from both limited or diffuse SSc patients caused dose-dependent stimulation of profibrotic gene expression and type I collagen and fibronectin production and secretion in normal human dermal fibroblasts in vitro.    Conclusion.  Serum exosomes from SSc patients contain miRNA displaying a markedly profibrotic profile and induce a profibrotic phenotype in target normal fibroblasts in vitro suggesting a plausible mechanism for the extension of the fibrotic SSc process to non-affected tissues.

Thirty males (GOLD stages II-III) underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test to the limit of tolerance (Tlim) at 75% of peak work rate on an electronically braked cycle ergometer. Exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation was considered to be present when end-expiratory (EE) V CW increased in relation to resting values. There was a noticeable heterogeneity in the patterns of V CW regulation as EEV CW increased non-linearly in 17/30 ‚Äúhyperinflators‚Äù and decreased in 13/30 ‚Äúnon-hyperinflators‚Äù (P < 0.05). EEV AB decreased slightly in 8 of the ‚Äúhyperinflators‚Äù, thereby reducing and slowing the rate of increase in end-inspiratory (EI) V CW (P < 0.05). In contrast, decreases in EEV CW in the ‚Äúnon-hyperinflators‚Äù were due to the combination of stable EEV RC with marked reductions in EEV AB . These patients showed lower EIV CW and end-exercise dyspnea scores but longer Tlim than their counterparts (P < 0.05). Dyspnea increased and Tlim decreased non-linearly with a faster rate of increase in EIV CW regardless of the presence or absence of dynamic hyperinflation (P < 0.001). However, no significant between-group differences were observed in metabolic, pulmonary gas exchange and cardiovascular responses to exercise.

Results Unconnected physicians were significantly more likely to be missing information they needed for patient encounters (13% of encounters for Unconnected physicians vs 7% for Connected physicians). Unconnected physicians were also more likely to report that missing information had consequences (23% vs 13% of encounters). Lab results were the most common type of patient information missing for both Unconnected and Connected specialists (25% for Unconnected physicians vs 11% Connected physicians). Conclusions The results from this study indicate that Canadian physicians commonly experience information gaps in ambulatory encounters, and that many of these gaps are of consequence to themselves, their patients, and the healthcare system. Wasting physician and patient time, as well as being forced to proceed with incomplete information, were the most common consequences of information gaps reported.",JMIR medical informatics,CS
0.538147889,30024110,Identification and Antibiotic-Susceptibility Profiling of Infectious Bacterial Agents: A Review of Current and Future Trends," Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most worrying threats to humankind with extremely high healthcare costs associated. The current technologies used in clinical microbiology to identify the bacterial agent and profile antimicrobial susceptibility are time-consuming and frequently expensive. As a result, physicians prescribe empirical antimicrobial therapies. This scenario is often the cause of therapeutic failures, causing higher mortality rates and healthcare costs, as well as the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. As such, new technologies for rapid identification of the pathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are needed. This review summarizes the current technologies, and the promising emerging and future alternatives for the identification and profiling of antimicrobial resistance bacterial agents, which are expected to revolutionize the field of clinical diagnostics.

0.154690659,23996831,"The Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS): Introduction to a novel, standardized, wide-range, high-quality, realistic picture database","Selecting appropriate stimuli to induce emotional states is essential in affective research. Only a few standardized affective stimulus databases have been created for auditory, language, and visual materials. Numerous studies have extensively employed these databases using both behavioral and neuroimaging methods. However, some limitations of the existing databases have recently been reported, including limited numbers of stimuli in specific categories or poor picture quality of the visual stimuli. In the present article, we introduce the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS), which consists of 1,356 realistic, high-quality photographs that are divided into five categories (people, faces, animals, objects, and landscapes). Affective ratings were collected from 204 mostly European participants. The pictures were rated according to the valence, arousal, and approach‚Äìavoidance dimensions using computerized bipolar semantic slider scales. Normative ratings for the categories are presented for each dimension. Validation of the ratings was obtained by comparing them to ratings generated using the Self-Assessment Manikin and the International Affective Picture System. In addition, the physical properties of the photographs are reported, including luminance, contrast, and entropy. The new database, with accompanying ratings and image parameters, allows researchers to select a variety of visual stimulus materials specific to their experimental questions of interest.

0.402324833,30202435,Bacterial conversion of depolymerized Kraft lignin,"Background Lignin is a potential feedstock for microbial conversion into various chemicals. However, the degradation rate of native or technical lignin is low, and depolymerization is needed to obtain reasonable conversion rates. In the current study, base-catalyzed depolymerization‚Äîusing NaOH (5 wt%)‚Äîof softwood Kraft lignin was conducted in a continuous-flow reactor system at temperatures in the range 190‚Äì240¬†¬∞C and residence times of 1 or 2¬†min. The ability of growth of nine bacterial strains belonging to the genera Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus was tested using the alkaline-treated lignin as a sole carbon source. Results Pseudomonas fluorescens and Rhodococcus opacus showed the best growth of the tested species on plates with lignin. Further evaluation of P. fluorescens and R. opacus was made in liquid cultivations with depolymerized lignin (DL) at a concentration of 1¬†g/L. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that R. opacus consumed most of the available lower molecular weight compounds (approximately 0.1‚Äì0.4¬†kDa) in the DL, but the weight distribution of larger fractions was almost unaffected. Importantly, the consumed compounds included guaiacol‚Äîone of the main monomers in the DL. SEC analysis of P. fluorescens culture broth, in contrast, did not show a large conversion of low molecular weight compounds, and guaiacol remained unconsumed. However, a significant shift in molecular weight distribution towards lower average weights was seen. Conclusions Rhodococcus opacus and P. fluorescens were identified as two potential microbial candidates for the conversion/consumption of base-catalyzed depolymerized lignin, acting on low and high molecular weight lignin fragments, respectively. These findings will be of relevance for designing bioconversion of softwood Kraft lignin.

Design/setting A prospective population-based cohort in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Participants A questionnaire was administrated to a sample of parents of 4546 children (36.7¬±1.5 months). Outcome measures Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of children was measured by HSCS-PS. The HSCS-PS consists of 10 original domains. Two single-item measures of ‚ÄòGeneral health‚Äô and ‚ÄòBehavior‚Äô were added. A disability score was calculated by summing up all 10 original domains to describe the overall health status. Feasibility was assessed by the response rate, percentages of missing answers, score distributions and the presence of floor/ceiling effects. Discriminant validity was analysed between subgroups with predefined conditions: low birth weight, preterm birth, wheezing, Ear-Nose-Throat surgical procedures and behaviour problems. In the absence of another HRQOL measure, this study uses the single-items ‚ÄòGeneral health‚Äô and ‚ÄòBehavior‚Äô as a first step to evaluate concurrent validity of the HSCS-PS. Results Feasibility: response rate was 69%. Ceiling effects were observed in all domains. Discriminant validity: the disability score discriminated clearly between subgroups of children born with a ‚Äòvery low birth weight‚Äô, ‚Äòvery preterm birth‚Äô, with ‚Äòfour or more than four times wheezing‚Äô, ‚Äòat least one ear-nose-throat surgical procedures‚Äô, ‚Äòbehaviour problems present‚Äô and the ‚Äòreference‚Äô group. Concurrent validity: HSCS-PS domains correlated better with hypothesised parallel additional domains than with other non-hypothesised original domains. Conclusions This study supports the feasibility and validity of the HSCS-PS among preschoolers in community settings. We recommend developing a utility-based scoring algorithm for the HSCS-PS.

0.467365182,29860637,Discovery of a Novel Periodontal Disease-Associated Bacterium," One of the world‚Äôs most common infectious disease, periodontitis (PD), derives from largely uncharacterized communities of oral bacteria growing as biofilms (a.k.a. plaque) on teeth and gum surfaces in periodontal pockets. Bacteria associated with periodontal disease trigger inflammatory responses in immune cells, which in later stages of the disease cause loss of both soft and hard tissue structures supporting teeth. Thus far, only a handful of bacteria have been characterized as infectious agents of PD. Although deep sequencing technologies, such as whole community shotgun sequencing have the potential to capture a detailed picture of highly complex bacterial communities in any given environment, we still lack major reference genomes for the oral microbiome associated with PD and other diseases. In recent work, by using a combination of supervised machine learning and genome assembly, we identified a genome from a novel member of the Bacteroidetes phylum in periodontal samples. Here, by applying a comparative metagenomics read-classification approach, including 272 metagenomes from various human body sites, and our previously assembled draft genome of the uncultivated Candidatus Bacteroides periocalifornicus (CBP) bacterium, we show CBP‚Äôs ubiquitous distribution in dental plaque, as well as its strong association with the well-known pathogenic ‚Äúred complex‚Äù that resides in deep periodontal pockets.

0.259630435,28470678,Learning curve estimation in medical devices and procedures: hierarchical modeling," In the use of medical device procedures, learning effects have been shown to be a critical component of medical device safety surveillance. To support their estimation of these effects, we evaluated multiple methods for modeling these rates within a complex simulated dataset representing patients treated by physicians clustered within institutions. We employed unique modeling for the learning curves to incorporate the learning hierarchy between institution and physicians and then modeled them within established methods that work with hierarchical data such as generalized estimating equations (GEE) and generalized linear mixed effect models. We found that both methods performed well, but that the GEE may have some advantages over the generalized linear mixed effect models for ease of modeling and a substantially lower rate of model convergence failures. We then focused more on using GEE and performed a separate simulation to vary the shape of the learning curve as well as employed various smoothing methods to the plots. We concluded that while both hierarchical methods can be used with our mathematical modeling of the learning curve, the GEE tended to perform better across multiple simulated scenarios in order to accurately model the learning effect as a function of physician and hospital hierarchical data in the use of a novel medical device. We found that the choice of shape used to produce the ‚Äòlearning-free‚Äô dataset would be dataset specific, while the choice of smoothing method was negligibly different from one another. This was an important application to understand how best to fit this unique learning curve function for hierarchical physician and hospital data. ",Statistics in medicine,CLINIC
0.901658579,30124943,Combat-Related Invasive Fungal Infections: Development of a Clinically Applicable Clinical Decision Support System For Early Risk Stratification," SUMMARY:   Introduction:  Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are associated with high morbidity and mortality. A better method of risk stratifying trauma patients for combat-related IFI is needed to improve clinical outcomes while minimizing morbidity related to overtreatment. We sought to develop combat-related IFI clinical decision support (CDS) tools to assist providers make treatment decisions both near the point of injury and subsequently at definitive treatment centers.    Materials and Methods:  We utilized a training dataset containing information from 227 combat-injured military personnel to build a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to predict the likelihood of developing IFI using information available at the point of initial resuscitation (THEATER model) and in the tertiary care setting (MEDCEN model). After selecting BBN models, external validation used a separate test dataset of 350 wounded warriors. Furthermore, the performance of the BBN models was compared to a ‚Äútwo-rule model‚Äù alone (based on physician experience), and combinations of the BBN models plus the two-rule model. The two-rule model contains plausible IFI criteria, but it has not been formally evaluated, and they are not currently actual clinical guidelines.    Results:  We found receiver operating characteristic areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.70 (95% CI: [0.62, 0.77]) and 0.68 (95% CI: [0.59, 0.76] ) for the THEATER and MEDCEN BBN models, respectively, on cross-validation. External validation with the highest-AUC BBN models produced THEATER AUC of 0.68 (95% CI:[0.58, 0.78]) and MEDCEN AUC of 0.67 (95% CI: [0.57, 0.78]). With the incorporation of the two-rule model in low IFI-prevalence populations, external validation AUC increased to 0.77 (95% CI:[0.69, 0.84]) for the THEATER model and 0.76 (95% CI:[0.68, 0.85]) for the LRMC model. The two-rule model alone has an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: [0.63, 0.81])    Conclusions:  Overall, the IFI tools produced clinically useful, robust models. However, the clinical utility of these models is highly dependent upon the clinician‚Äôs individual risk tolerance. The threshold probability for optimal clinical use of this CDS tool is currently being evaluated in an ongoing clinical utilization study. CDS tools, such as these, may facilitate early diagnosis of patients with or at risk for IFI, permitting early or prophylactic treatment with the aim of improving outcomes.

However, information on localized outages is limited. Objective: The study sought to examine potential health impacts of citywide and localized outages in New York City (NYC). Methods: Along with the citywide 2003 outage, localized outages in July 1999 and July 2006 were identified. We additionally investigated localized, warm- and cold-weather outages that occurred in any of 66 NYC electric-grid networks during 2002‚Äì2014 using New York State Public Service Commission data. Mortality and hospitalizations were geocoded and linked to the networks. Associations were estimated using Poisson time-series regression, including examining distributed lags and adjusting for temperature and temporal trends. Network-specific estimates were pooled by season. Results: Respiratory disease hospitalizations were associated with the 2006 localized outage [cumulative relative risk [CRR] over 0‚Äì1 lag day, lag 01 = 2.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08, 4.74)] and the 2003 citywide outage, but not with other localized, warm-weather outages. Renal disease hospitalizations were associated with the 2003 citywide outage, and with localized, warm-weather outages, pooled across networks [RR at lag 3 = 1.16 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.34)], but not the 2006 localized outage. All-cause mortality was positively associated with the 1999, 2003, and 2006 outages (significant for the 2003 outage only), but not with other localized, warm-weather outages. Localized, cold-weather outages were associated with all-cause mortality [ lag 01  CRR = 1.06 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.12)] and cardiovascular disease hospitalizations [ lag 01  CRR = 1.14 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.26)], and fewer respiratory disease hospitalizations [ lag 03  CRR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.97)]. Conclusions: Localized outages may affect health.

Unlike externally flagellated bacteria, spirochetes possess a unique periplasmic flagellar structure called the collar. This spirochete-specific novel component is linked to the flagellar basal body; however, nothing is known about the proteins encoding the collar or their function in any spirochete. To identify a collar protein and determine its function, we employed a comprehensive strategy that included genetic, biochemical, and microscopic analyses. We found that BB0286 (FlbB) is a novel flagellar motor protein, which is located around the flagellar basal body. Deletion of bb0286 has a profound effect on collar formation, assembly of other flagellar structures, morphology, and motility of the spirochete. Orientation of the flagella toward the cell body is critical for determination of wild-type spirochete‚Äôs wave-like morphology and motility. Here, we provide the first evidence that FlbB is a key determinant of normal orientation of the flagella and collar assembly. ",Molecular microbiology,BIOCHEM

Participants 109‚Äâ118 men and 254‚Äâ870 women, mainly aged 37-70. Main outcome measures Hazard rate ratios expressing the relative risk of cancer incidence for former and current alcohol consumption among EPIC participants. Hazard rate ratios combined with representative information on alcohol consumption to calculate alcohol attributable fractions of causally related cancers by country and sex. Partial alcohol attributable fractions for consumption higher than the recommended upper limit (two drinks a day for men with about 24 g alcohol, one for women with about 12 g alcohol) and the estimated total annual number of cases of alcohol attributable cancer. Results If we assume causality, among men and women, 10% (95% confidence interval 7 to 13%) and 3% (1 to 5%) of the incidence of total cancer was attributable to former and current alcohol consumption in the selected European countries. For selected cancers the figures were 44% (31 to 56%) and 25% (5 to 46%) for upper aerodigestive tract, 33% (11 to 54%) and 18% (‚àí3 to 38%) for liver, 17% (10 to 25%) and 4% (‚àí1 to 10%) for colorectal cancer for men and women, respectively, and 5.0% (2 to 8%) for female breast cancer.

Methods: The presence of CTCs was detected in 298 patients with MBC using a real-time PCR (RT-PCR assay. In 44 patients, the detection of CTCs was evaluated by both the CellSearch and the RT-PCR assay. Interaction with known prognostic factors and association of CTCs with clinical outcome were investigated. Results: There was a strong correlation between the detection of CTCs by both assays. CK-19mRNA-positive CTCs were detected in 201 (67%) patients and their detection was independent of various patients' clinico-pathological characteristics. The median progression-free survival (PFS; 9.2 vs 11.9 months (mo), P =0.003) and the overall survival (OS; 29.7 vs 38.9 mo, P =0.016) were significantly shorter in patients with detectable CK-19mRNA-positive CTCs compared with patients without detectable CTCs. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that oestrogen receptor status, performance status and detection of CTCs were emerged as independent prognostic factors associated with decreased PFS and OS. Conclusion: The detection of CK-19mRNA-positive CTCs in patients with MBC before front-line therapy could define a subgroup of patients with dismal clinical outcome.",British journal of cancer,ONCO

We have found that the broken symmetry will cause¬† Fanolike resonances in the extinction spectrum, resulting in the enhancement of SHG efficiency. When one of the gold elliptical nanodisks rotates, the SHG efficiency increases first and then decreases. In addition, we have also shown that the SHG signal blue-shifts with the reduction of efficiency when the separation between two nanodisks increases. Furthermore, when the nanodisks become thicker, the SHG signal also blue-shifts with the increase of efficiency. The SHG signal from this simple plasmonic structure with high efficiency and tunability may pave a way toward practical applications in sensing and generating a new light source.",ACS omega,CHEM
0.522269448,29791852,Melanopsin Retinal Ganglion Cells Regulate Cone Photoreceptor Lamination in the Mouse Retina," SUMMARY  Newborn neurons follow molecular cues to reach their final destination, but whether early life experience influences lamination remains largely unexplored. As light is among the first stimuli to reach the developing nervous system via intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), we asked whether ipRGCs could affect lamination in the developing mouse retina. We show here that ablation of ipRGCs causes cone photoreceptors to mislocalize at different apicobasal positions in the retina. This effect is partly mediated by light-evoked activity in ipRGCs, as dark rearing or silencing of ipRGCs leads a subset of cones to mislocalize. Furthermore, ablation of ipRGCs alters the cone transcriptome and decreases expression of the dopamine receptor D4, while injection of L-DOPA or D4 receptor agonist rescues the displaced cone phenotype observed in dark-reared animals. These results show that early light-mediated activity in ipRGCs influences neuronal lamination and identify ipRGC-elicited dopamine release as a mechanism influencing cone position.   In Brief  Tufford et al. show that light acting through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) controls cone photoreceptor positioning in the developing mouse retina, using dopamine signaling as a cue.

0.384294552,20711486,Improving spatial resolution of a fiber bundle optical biopsy system," To reduce the number of invasive tissue biopsies and needle aspirations performed during cancer screenings, endo-microscopes can be used to image tissue in vivo . However, when optical fiber bundles are used to transmit the image, the resolution of such systems is limited by undersampling due to the spacing of the bundle's individual fibers for a given field of view. We propose a method to increase the sampling of an optical biopsy system and thereby improve the system's resolution. The method involves taking several images, shifting the object and fiber bundle slightly relative to each other from one image to the next. Multiple shifting patterns were evaluated to determine which provided the greatest increase in resolution. The shifted images are later realigned and recombined by a custom algorithm. By combining four shifted images of a USAF resolution target, we were able to measure an improvement in the resolution of the system from approximately 3.9 Œºm to 2.2 Œºm. When tested on cultured cells, a visible increase in detail was detectable. This technique can provide the basis for improving the diagnostic abilities of optical biopsy systems.

However, its implication in the absence of clinical evidence of cardiac reason is not well established. Aims: The aim of this study was to identify the implications of positive TnT in traumatic chest injury (TCI) patients regardless of the cardiac involvement. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all TCI patients admitted to level 1 trauma center between 2008 and 2011. Patients who underwent TnT testing were divided into two groups: Group 1 (positive TnT) and Group 2 (negative TnT). The two groups were analyzed and compared, and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of TnT positivity and mortality. Results: Out of 993 blunt TCI patients, 19.3% had positive TnT (Group 1). On comparison to Group 2, patients in Group 1 were 5 years younger and more likely to have head, cardiac, hepatic, splenic, and pelvic injuries, in addition to lung contusion. Positive TnT was associated with higher Injury Severity Score (ISS) ( P = 0.001), higher chest Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) ( P = 0.001), and longer hospital stay ( P = 0.03). In addition, Group 1 patients were more likely to undergo chest tube insertion, exploratory laparotomy, mechanical ventilation, and tracheostomy. Twenty patients had cardiac involvement, and of them 14 had positive TnT. Among 973 patients who showed no evidence of cardiac involvement, 178 had positive TnT (18.3%). There were 104 deaths (60% in Group 1). On multivariate regression analysis, the predictors of hospital mortality were positive TnT, head injury, and high ISS, whereas, the predictors of TnT positivity were cardiac, hepatic, and pelvic injuries; higher ISS; and age. Conclusions: Positive TnT in blunt TCI patients is a common challenge, particularly in polytrauma cases. Patients with positive TnT tend to have the worst outcome even in the absence of clinical evidence of acute cardiac involvement. Positive TnT is also a reflection of the severity of chest or extrathoracic injuries; however, further prospective studies are warranted.",North American journal of medical sciences,CLINIC

Significant associations with CHB risk were observed for the rs705382 SNP after adjusting for sex, age, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index. When stratified by sex and age, this positive association was significantly strengthened among men and individuals over 40 years old. Moreover, a decreased risk of LC was associated with the rs705382 CG and the combined GG + CG genotypes among women, with borderline statistical significance. In haplotype analyses, the haplotype GA was associated with a 1.68-fold increase in the risk of HCC.

Participants 1814 pharmacies not opting out and with more than 5 dispensings of the target medications during the 6-month baseline were randomised by a 2√ó2 factorial design to feedback first for hypertension adherence (907 control, 907 intervention) followed by randomisation for asthma adherence (791 control, 807 intervention). 1422 of 1814 pharmacies had complete information available during the follow-up for hypertension intervention (706 intervention, 716 control), and 1301 of 1598 had the follow-up information for asthma (657 intervention, 644 control). Intervention Using provincial billing data to measure performance, mailed comparative feedback reported the pharmacy-level percentage of dispensings to patients non-adherent to antihypertensive medications or overusing asthma rescue inhalers. Primary and secondary outcome measures The number of hypertension/asthma services billed per pharmacy and percentage of dispensings to non-adherent patients over the 12‚ÄÖmonths post intervention. Results Feedback on the asthma measure led to increased provision of asthma services (control 0.2, intervention 0.4, RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.46). However, this did not translate into reductions in patients‚Äô overuse of rescue inhalers (control 45.5%, intervention 44.6%, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01). For non-adherence to antihypertensive medications, feedback resulted in no difference in either provision of hypertension services (control 0.7, intervention 0.8, RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.82) or antihypertensive treatment adherence (control 27.9%, intervention 28.0%, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00). Baseline performance did not influence results, and there was no evidence of a cumulative effect with repeated feedback.

0.104110414,29193439,Jackhammer Esophagus: Assessing the balance between pre-peak and post-peak contractile integral,"  Background:  We hypothesized that symptoms in Jackhammer esophagus (JH) are associated with an imbalance between the pre-peak and post-peak phases of contraction. Thus, we developed a method to distinguish the contractile integral components of pre-peak and post-peak phase contractile activity to determine the contribution of each phase and their association with dysphagia.    Methods:  Patients diagnosed with JH were enrolled and compared to controls. The first 5 intact swallows during manometry were analyzed. A single swallow was divided into a pre-peak and post-peak phase. The contractile integral of each phase and its corresponding time-controlled integral were computed. All metrics were compared between controls and JH patients subcategorized by the Impaction Dysphagia Question (IDQ) score with cut-off of 6.    Key Results:  38 JH patients and 71 controls were included. Twelve JH patients had IDQ ‚â§6 and 26 with IDQ > 6. JH patients had higher contractile integral in both phases, and a higher ratio between post-peak to pre-peak contractile integral independent of duration. Similarly, JH patients with an IDQ >6 had higher contractile metrics than those with IDQ‚â§ 6. There was a correlation between the IDQ score and the ratio within the post-peak to pre-peak contractile integral ( r =0.375).    Conclusions:  Abnormalities in contractile integral of the post-peak phase are more significant in JH with higher dysphagia scores Although the total post-peak contractile integral was higher in symptomatic patients, this was associated with longer duration of post-peak activity suggesting that dysphagia patients with JH have a defect in the post-peak phase of peristalsis.

0.063397195,26454679,Liver-Directed Surgery of Neuroendocrine Metastases: What is the Optimal Strategy?,"  Introduction  Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) frequently metastasize to the liver. Surgical debulking offers symptomatic relief and improved survival. However, the frequent presence of multifocal, bilobar disease and high recurrence rates introduce doubt regarding their optimal management. Parenchyma-sparing debulking (PSD) procedures (ablation, enucleation, wedge resections) may offer similar survival improvements as resection, while minimizing morbidity and preserving functional liver tissue.    Methods  Clinicopathologic variables from 228 patients with small bowel (SBNETs) or pancreatic NETs (PNETs) managed surgically at one institution were collected. Liver-directed surgery (LDS) was carried out when significant debulking was deemed feasible. Survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.    Results  108 PNET and SBNET patients underwent LDS with primarily PSD procedures. Nearly two-thirds of patients achieved 70% cytoreduction and 84% had concurrent resection of their primary. The median number of lesions treated was 6 (range 1‚Äì36). There were no 30-day operative mortalities. The 30-day major complication rate was 13.0%. Patients that achieved 70% cytoreduction enjoyed improved progression free (median 3.2 years) and overall survival (median not reached).    Conclusion  PSD procedures are safe and can achieve significant cytoreduction, which is associated with improved survival. Lowering the debulking target threshold to 70% may benefit NET patients by increasing eligibility for cytoreduction.  ",Surgery,CLINIC
0.845343141,26966513,EEG correlates of social interaction at distance,"This study investigated EEG correlates of social interaction at distance between twenty-five pairs of participants who were not connected by any traditional channels of communication. Each session involved the application of 128 stimulations separated by intervals of random duration ranging from 4 to 6 seconds. One of the pair received a one-second stimulation from a light signal produced by an arrangement of red LEDs, and a simultaneous 500 Hz sinusoidal audio signal of the same length. The other member of the pair sat in an isolated sound-proof room, such that any sensory interaction between the pair was impossible. An analysis of the Event-Related Potentials associated with sensory stimulation using traditional averaging methods showed a distinct peak at approximately 300 ms, but only in the EEG activity of subjects who were directly stimulated. However, when a new algorithm was applied to the EEG activity based on the correlation between signals from all active electrodes, a weak but robust response was also detected in the EEG activity of the passive member of the pair, particularly within 9 ‚Äì 10 Hz in the Alpha range. Using the Bootstrap method and the Monte Carlo emulation, this signal was found to be statistically significant.",F1000Research,NEURO
0.235669342,30546412,Gastric calcifying fibrous tumor: A clinicopathological study of nine cases,"The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinicopathological characteristics presented in 9 cases of gastric calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT), and investigate the expressions and clinical implications of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), estrogen receptor (ER) and vimentin in gastric CFTs. The clinical and pathological information of 9 patients with CFTs was investigated retrospectively. Subsequently, the expression of GPER, ER and vimentin were examined using immunohistochemistry, and a literature search for gastric CFT was conducted. The 9 patients were 40‚Äì71 years old with a mean age of 52.22 years, including 6 female and 3 male patients. Pathological features included dense hyalinized collagen fibers with a psammomatous body or dystrophic calcification, and the infiltration of scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemically, all cases expressed vimentin and GPER, whereas ER expression was negative. Using a database research, 25 studies regarding gastric CFT were identified, including 48 cases with a sex ratio (female:male) of 1.4:1. In addition, the number of female patients was twice the number of male patients in patients <50 years old, whereas the number was almost equal between women and men ‚â•50 years of age. Gastric CFT is a benign lesion with a good prognosis and a predilection for female patients, particularly premenopausal women. Estrogen may serve a role in this female predominance, and this may be mediated by GPER rather than ER.",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,CLINIC

Amygdala hyperresponsivity, found both in behaviorally inhibited and anxious individuals, suggests that amygdala dysfunction may represent a marker of anxiety risk. However, broader amygdala networks have not been examined in individuals with a history of childhood BI. This study uses resting state fMRI to assess amygdala intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) in 38 healthy young adults (19 with a history of BI, 19 with no history of BI) selected from a longitudinal study. Centromedial, basolateral, and superficial amygdala iFCs were compared between groups and examined in relation to self-report measures of anxiety. Group differences were observed in amygdala iFC with prefrontal cortex, striatum, anterior insula, and cerebellum. Adults characterized with BI in childhood endorsed greater state anxiety prior to entering the scanner, which was associated with several of the group differences. Findings support enduring effects of BI on amygdala circuitry, even in the absence of current psychopathology. ",Biological psychology,NEURO

This study aimed to determine the changes in gene expression patterns associated with time dependent CG exposure to neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Microarray analysis revealed a total of 451, 572 and 1127 differentially expressed genes after CG exposure at 1, 4 and 8 hours respectively. A total of 54 overlapped genes at each time point were mapped by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The top Up-regulated genes included Hamp , SMAD6 , NR4A1 , FOSL2 , ID3 and SLAMF7 , and down-regulated genes included CYR61 , GDF6 , Olr640 , Vom2r36 , DUSP6 and MMP20 . Our data suggest that there are multiple deregulated pathways associated with cardiomyocyte death after CG exposure, including JAK/Stat signaling, IL-9 signaling and Nur77 signaling. In addition, we also generated the molecular network of expressed gene and found most of the molecules were connected to ERK1/2, caspase, BCR (complex) and Cyclins. Our study reveals the ability to assess time-dependent changes in gene expression patterns in NRCMs associated with CG exposure. The global gene expression profiles may provide insight into the cellular mechanism that regulates CG dependent myocyte apoptosis. In future, the pathways important in CG response, as well as the genes found to be differentially expressed might represent the therapeutic targets for myocyte survival in heart failure.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2‚Ä≤-deoxycytodine (decitabine) can reverse resistance to carboplatin in women with relapsed ovarian cancer. Methods: Patients progressing 6‚Äì12 months after previous platinum therapy were randomised to decitabine on day 1 and carboplatin (AUC 6) on day 8, every 28 days or carboplatin alone. The primary objective was response rate in patients with methylated hMLH1 tumour DNA in plasma. Results: After a pre-defined interim analysis, the study closed due to lack of efficacy and poor treatment deliverability in 15 patients treated with the combination. Responses by GCIG criteria were 9 out of 14 vs 3 out of 15 and by RECIST were 6 out of 13 vs 1 out of 12 for carboplatin and carboplatin/decitabine, respectively. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was more common with the combination (60% vs 15.4%) as was G2/3 carboplatin hypersensitivity (47% vs 21%). Conclusions: With this schedule, the addition of decitabine appears to reduce rather than increase the efficacy of carboplatin in partially platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer and is difficult to deliver. Patient-selection strategies, different schedules and other demethylating agents should be considered in future combination studies.",British journal of cancer,ONCO

Phytochemicals may be promising anticancer agents given their various chemical structures and diverse biological activities. Damnacanthal (DAM) is a major bioactive component of Noni, which has been investigated previously as a cancer-preventive or chemotherapeutic agent. DAM has also been reported to exhibit anti-proliferative activity in several cancer types. In the present study, it was identified that DAM downregulates chromosome maintenance protein 1 (CRM1) expression in human cancer cells. The application of chitosan-based nanoparticles (NPs) with DAM also induced CRM1 downregulation, which suggests that chitosan-based NPs may be effective vehicles for delivery of phytochemicals such as DAM. It was also identified that DAM increased the levels of the tumor suppressor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-activated gene 1 in the nucleus, thereby leading to enhanced anticancer effects.

We report that mGlu3 receptors, which are traditionally linked to the control of neurotransmitter release, support mGlu5 receptor signaling in neurons and largely contribute to the robust mGlu5 receptor-mediated polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in the early postnatal life. In cortical pyramidal neurons, mGlu3 receptor activation potentiated mGlu5 receptor-mediated somatic Ca 2+ mobilization, and mGlu3 receptor-mediated long-term depression in the prefrontal cortex required the endogenous activation of mGlu5 receptors. The interaction between mGlu3 and mGlu5 receptors was also relevant to mechanisms of neuronal toxicity, with mGlu3 receptors shaping the influence of mGlu5 receptors on excitotoxic neuronal death. These findings shed new light into the complex role played by mGlu receptors in physiology and pathology, and suggest reconsideration of some of the current dogmas in the mGlu receptor field.

0.208079841,26506067,Efficacy and Tolerability of a Novel Biopsy Device for Removing Benign Epidermal Skin Lesions,"  BACKGROUND  The shave biopsy using a razor with an open blade is the current standard of care for sampling superficial skin lesions.    OBJECTIVE  To enhance safety, the authors developed a novel biopsy device with a closed blade design for removing the epidermal layer of skin and evaluated against the open razor blade for tolerability, scarring, and accuracy in histological diagnosis.    MATERIALS AND METHODS  Shave biopsies were performed using the novel device or razor blade on benign epidermal skin lesions in 10 patients on comparable body parts. Digital photography, colorimetry, scar scale evaluations, and questionnaires were used to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the devices.    RESULTS  For all patients, accurate histological diagnoses were made regardless of device type. No statistically significant differences were detected between the novel device and razor blade in terms of scar scale assessments, colorimetry, and questionnaire responses. Both patients and the participating dermatologist reported satisfaction with the safety and performance of the novel device. No injuries to the provider occurred with either instrument.    CONCLUSION  The rotating sphere biopsy device is a potential alternative to the razor blade with comparable tolerability, scarring, and accuracy in histological diagnoses, offering improved safety for patients and health care providers.

0.627786136,30065793,CD36 ‚Äì a plausible modifier of disease phenotype in familial adenomatous polyposis,"Background Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a well characterised genetic predisposition to early onset colorectal cancer (CRC) that is characterised by polyposis of the colon and rectum. Animal models have consistently suggested the role of modifier genes in determining disease phenotype, yet none have been substantiated in the human population. The mouse homologue of cluster of differentiation 36 ( CD36) has been proposed as a modifier of disease in the MIN mouse model of FAP. Methods Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); rs1049673, rs1761667 and rs1984112 in CD36, have been investigated in 275 FAP patients to determine if they were associated with age of polyposis or risk of developing disease. Results The results revealed a substantially lower age of polyposis diagnosis for patients belonging to the severe FAP group (harbouring adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) variants in the mutation cluster region (MCR)) and high age for patients in the attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) group for SNPs rs1761667 and rs1984112. Conclusions This study provides evidence for patients belonging to the MCR and AFAP groups harbouring specific genotypes for SNPs in CD36 to initiate screening/treatment for FAP at much earlier (MCR) and much later (AFAP) ages than the norm in today‚Äôs clinical practice. The findings need to be verified in an independent FAP patient cohort.",Hereditary cancer in clinical practice,POPGENE
0.920746289,20878715,META-ANALYSIS OF GENETIC ASSOCIATION STUDIES AND ADJUSTMENT FOR MULTIPLE TESTING OF CORRELATED SNPS AND TRAITS," Meta-analysis has become a key component of well-designed genetic association studies due to the boost in statistical power achieved by combining results across multiple samples of individuals and the need to validate observed associations in independent studies. Meta-analyses of genetic association studies based on multiple SNPs and traits are subject to the same multiple testing issues as single-sample studies, but it is often difficult to adjust accurately for the multiple tests. Procedures such as Bonferroni may control the type I error rate but will generally provide an overly harsh correction if SNPs or traits are correlated. Depending on study design, availability of individual-level data, and computational requirements, permutation testing may not be feasible in a meta-analysis framework. In this paper we present methods for adjusting for multiple correlated tests under several study designs commonly employed in meta-analyses of genetic association tests. Our methods are applicable to both prospective meta-analyses in which several samples of individuals are analyzed with the intent to combine results, and retrospective meta-analyses, in which results from published studies are combined, including situations in which 1) individual-level data are unavailable, and 2) different sets of SNPs are genotyped in different studies due to random missingness or two-stage design. We show through simulation that our methods accurately control the rate of type I error and achieve improved power over multiple testing adjustments that do not account for correlation between SNPs or traits.

Coarticulatory data for 46 young adult speakers, 23 who stutter and 23 who do not stutter show coarticulatory patterns in young adults who stutter that are no different from typical young adults. Additionally, the stability of velar-vowel productions is analyzed in token-to-token variability found in multiple repetitions of the same velar-vowel sequence. Across participants, identical patterns of coarticulation were found between people who do and do not stutter, but decreased stability was found in velar closure production in people who stutter. Decreased stability was found in significant subset of people who stutter while others appeared no different than typical speakers. Outcomes of this study suggest that articulatory maturation in young adults who stutter is, on average, no different from typical young adults, but that some young adults who stutter could be viewed as having less stably activated articulatory sub-systems.

0.057813263,27582731,Effects of Microbial Aerosol in Poultry House on Meat Ducks' Immune Function,"The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of microbial aerosols on immune function of ducks and shed light on the establishment of microbial aerosol concentration standards for poultry. A total of 1800 1-d-old cherry valley ducks were randomly divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E) with 360 ducks in each. To obtain objective data, each group had three replications. Concentrations of airborne bacteria, fungi, endotoxin in different groups were created by controlling ventilation and bedding cleaning frequency. Group A was the control group and hygienic conditions deteriorated progressively from group B to E. A 6-stage Andersen impactor was used to detect the aerosol concentration of aerobes, gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and AGI-30 microbial air sampler detect the endotoxin, and Composite Gas Detector detect the noxious gas. In order to assess the immune function of meat ducks, immune indicators including H5 AIV antibody titer, IgG, IL-2, T-lymphocyte transformation rate, lysozyme and immune organ indexes were evaluated. Correlation coefficients were also calculated to evaluate the relationships among airborne bacteria, fungi, endotoxin, and immune indicators. The results showed that the concentration of airborne aerobe, gram-negative bacteria, fungi, endotoxin have a strong correlation to H5 AIV antibody titer, IgG, IL-2, T-lymphocyte transformation rate, lysozyme, and immune organ indexes, respectively. In addition, when the concentration of microbial aerosol reach the level of group D, serum IgG (6‚Äì8 weeks), lysozyme (4 week) were significantly higher than in group A (P < 0.05); serum IL-2 (7 and 8 weeks), T-lymphocyte transformation rate, lysozyme (7 and 8 weeks), spleen index (6 and 8 weeks), and bursa index (8 week) were significantly lower than in group A ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The results indicated that a high level of microbial aerosol adversely affected the immune level of meat ducks. The microbial aerosol values in group D provide a basis for recommending upper limit concentrations of microbial aerosols for healthy meat ducks.",Frontiers in microbiology,ANIMAL

Methods: We performed a pooled analysis of six case‚Äìcontrol studies (1961 cases and 2609 controls) contributing to the International Lung Cancer Consortium. Potential associations were investigated with multivariable unconditional logistic regression and meta-analytic models. Multinomial logistic regressions were performed to investigate lung cancer risk across histologic types. Results: A reduced lung cancer risk was found for OC (odds ratio (OR)=0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68‚Äì0.97) and HRT ever users (OR=0.77; 95% CI: 0.66‚Äì0.90).

0.911302659,30072739,Sno-derived RNAs are prevalent molecular markers of cancer immunity," Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) constitute a family of non-coding RNAs that are classically known as guide RNAs for processing and modification of ribosomal RNAs. Recently, it was discovered that snoRNAs can be further processed into sno-derived RNAs (sdRNAs), some of which are known to exhibit microRNA-like properties. SdRNAs have been implicated in human cancer; however, a systems-level sdRNA landscape in human cancers is lacking. Through integrative analysis of ~22 nt size-selected smRNA-seq datasets from 10,262 patient samples across 32 cancer types, we mapped a pan-cancer sdRNAome and interrogated its signatures in multiple clinically relevant features, particularly cancer immunity and clinical outcome. Aggregating sdRNA abundances by parental snoRNAs, these expression signatures alone are sufficient to distinguish patients with distinct cancer types. Interestingly, a large panel of sdRNAs are significantly correlated with features of the tumor-immune microenvironment, such as immunosuppressive markers, CD8+ T cell infiltration, cytolytic T cell activity, and tumor vasculature. A set of individual sdRNAs with tumor-immune signatures can also stratify patient survival. These findings implicate snoRNAs and their derivative sdRNAs as a class of prevalent non-coding molecular markers of human cancer immunity. ",Oncogene,ONCO

0.62549668,27540365,Olfactory Receptors Modulate Physiological Processes in Human Airway Smooth Muscle Cells,"Pathophysiological mechanisms in human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) significantly contribute to the progression of chronic inflammatory airway diseases with limited therapeutic options, such as severe asthma and COPD. These abnormalities include the contractility and hyperproduction of inflammatory proteins. To develop therapeutic strategies, key pathological mechanisms, and putative clinical targets need to be identified. In the present study, we demonstrated that the human olfactory receptors (ORs) OR1D2 and OR2AG1 are expressed at the RNA and protein levels in HASMCs. Using fluorometric calcium imaging, specific agonists for OR2AG1 and OR1D2 were identified to trigger transient Ca 2+ increases in HASMCs via a cAMP-dependent signal transduction cascade. Furthermore, the activation of OR2AG1 via amyl butyrate inhibited the histamine-induced contraction of HASMCs, whereas the stimulation of OR1D2 with bourgeonal led to an increase in cell contractility. In addition, OR1D2 activation induced the secretion of IL-8 and GM-CSF. Both effects were inhibited by the specific OR1D2 antagonist undecanal. We herein provide the first evidence to show that ORs are functionally expressed in HASMCs and regulate pathophysiological processes. Therefore, ORs might be new therapeutic targets for these diseases, and blocking ORs could be an auspicious strategy for the treatment of early-stage chronic inflammatory lung diseases.",Frontiers in physiology,PHYSIO

0.673717162,29470170,Sub-network Kernels for Measuring Similarity of Brain Connectivity Networks in Disease Diagnosis," As a simple representation of interactions among distributed brain regions, brain networks have been widely applied to automated diagnosis of brain diseases, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) and its early stage, i.e. , mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In brain network analysis, a challenging task is how to measure the similarity between a pair of networks. Although many graph kernels ( i.e. , kernels defined on graphs) have been proposed for measuring the topological similarity of a pair of brain networks, most of them are defined using general graphs, thus ignoring the uniqueness of each node in brain networks. That is, each node in a brain network denotes a particular brain region, which is a specific characteristics of brain networks. Accordingly, in this paper, we construct a novel sub-network kernel for measuring the similarity between a pair of brain networks and then apply it to brain disease classification. Different from current graph kernels, our proposed sub-network kernel not only takes into account the inherent characteristic of brain networks, but also captures multi-level (from local to global) topological properties of nodes in brain networks, which are essential for defining the similarity measure of brain networks. To validate the efficacy of our method, we perform extensive experiments on subjects with baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained from the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art graph-based methods in MCI classification.

Current study was aimed to determine the effect of clinically relevant dosage of nicotine (equivalent to light smoker) on aortic reactivity, oxidative stress markers and histomorphological changes. Twelve age-matched male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups, i.e.: normal saline as control or 0.6 mg/kg nicotine for 28 days (i.p., n=6 per group). On day-29, the rats were sacrificed and the thoracic aorta was dissected immediately for further studies. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) of nicotine-treated vs. control were significantly increased (p<0.05). Nicotine-treated group showed significant (p<0.05) increase tunica media thickness, and decrease in lumen diameter, suggesting vascular remodelling which lead to prior hypertension state. The phenylephrine (PE)-induced contractile response in nicotine group was significantly higher than control group (ED 50 =1.44√ó10 5 M vs. 4.9√ó10 6 M) (p<0.05~0.001).

0.842210334,29172152,Safety and immune regulatory properties of canine induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells," Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit broad immune modulatory activity in vivo and can suppress T cell proliferation and dendritic cell activation in vitro. Currently, most MSC for clinical usage are derived from younger donors, due to ease of procurement and to the superior immune modulatory activity. However, the use of MSC from multiple unrelated donors makes it difficult to standardize study results and compare outcomes between different clinical trials. One solution is the use of MSC derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC); as iPSC-derived MSC have nearly unlimited proliferative potential and exhibit in vitro phenotypic stability. Given the value of dogs as a spontaneous disease model for pre-clinical evaluation of stem cell therapeutics, we investigated the functional properties of canine iPSC-derived MSC (iMSC), including immune modulatory properties and potential for teratoma formation. We found that canine iMSC downregulated expression of pluripotency genes and appeared morphologically similar to conventional MSC. Importantly, iMSC retained a stable phenotype after multiple passages, did not form teratomas in immune deficient mice, and did not induce tumor formation in dogs following systemic injection. We concluded therefore that iMSC were phenotypically stable, immunologically potent, safe with respect to tumor formation, and represented an important new source of cells for therapeutic modulation of inflammatory disorders.

Images of an alignment test object (calibration phantom) fixed in the field of view of the scanner are processed to determine the nine geometric parameters for each view. The parameter values are found directly using formulae applied to the projected positions of the test object marker points onto the detector. Each view is treated independently, and no restrictions are made on the position of the cone vertex, or on the position or orientation of the detector. The proposed test object consists of 14 small point-like objects arranged with four points on each of three orthogonal lines, and two points on a diagonal line. This test object is shown to provide unique solutions for all possible scanner geometries, even when partial measurement information is lost by points superimposing in the calibration scan. For the many situations where the cone vertex stays reasonably close to a central plane (for circular, planar, or near-planar trajectories), a simpler version of the test object is appropriate. The simpler object consists of six points, two per orthogonal line, but with some restrictions on the positioning of the test object. This paper focuses on the principles and mathematical justifications for the method. Numerical simulations of the calibration process and reconstructions using estimated parameters are also presented to validate the method and to provide evidence of the robustness of the technique.

Pedestal waveguides based on silicon are demonstrated as broadband mid-IR sensors. Our low-loss mid-IR directional couplers demonstrated in SiN x waveguides are useful in differential sensing applications. Photonic crystal cavities and microdisk resonators based on chalcogenide glasses for high sensitivity are also demonstrated as effective mid-IR sensors. Polymer-based functionalization layers, to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of our sensor devices, are also presented. We discuss the design of mid-IR chalcogenide waveguides integrated with polycrystalline PbTe detectors on a monolithic silicon platform for optical sensing, wherein the use of a low-index spacer layer enables the evanescent coupling of mid-IR light from the waveguides to the detector. Finally, we show the successful fabrication processing of our first prototype mid-IR waveguide-integrated detectors.",Science and technology of advanced materials,ENG
0.527236771,21391553,Development of Polarizable Models for Molecular Mechanical Calculations I: Parameterization of Atomic Polarizability," In this work, four types of polarizable models have been developed for calculating interactions between atomic charges and induced point dipoles. These include the Applequist, Thole linear, Thole exponential model, and the Thole Tinker-like. The polarizability models have been optimized to reproduce the experimental static molecular polarizabilities obtained from the molecular refraction measurements on a set of 420 molecules reported by Bosque and Sales. We grouped the models into five sets depending on the interaction types, i.e. whether the interactions of two atoms that form bond, bond angle and dihedral angle are turned off or scaled down. When 1-2 (bonded), 1-3 (separated by two bonds) interactions are turned off and/or 1-4 (separated by three bonds) interactions are scaled down, all the models including the Applequist model achieved similar performance: the average percentage errors (APE) ranges from 1.15% to 1.23%, and The average unsigned errors (AUE) ranges from 0.143 to 0.158 √Ö 3 . When the short-range 1-2, 1-3 and full 1-4 terms are taken into account (Set D models), the APE ranges from 1.30% to 1.58% for the three Thole models whereas the Applequist model (DA) has a significantly larger APE (3.82%). The AUE ranges from 0.166 to 0.196 √Ö 3 for the three Thole models, compared to 0.446 √Ö 3 for the Applequist model. Further assessement using the 70-molecule van Duijnen and Swart data set clearly showed that the developed models are both accurate and highly transferable and are in fact more accurate than the models developed using this particular data set (Set E models). The fact that A, B, and C model sets are notably more accurate than both D and E model sets strongly suggests that the inclusion of 1-2 and 1-3 interactions reduces the transferability and accuracy.

0.256518957,30557992,Association between rs1800629 polymorphism in tumor necrosis factor-Œ± gene and dilated cardiomyopathy susceptibility Evidence from case‚Äìcontrol studies,"Abstract Objective: Several published studies have investigated the association between the ‚àí308G/A (rs1800629) polymorphism in the tumor necrosis factor-Œ± ( TNF -Œ±) gene and the risk of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the TNF -Œ± gene polymorphism has a controversial role in the pathogenesis of DCM among different populations. In the present study, a meta-analysis was performed to resolve this inconsistency. Methods: Potentially eligible papers reporting an association between the TNF -Œ± rs1800629 polymorphism and DCM susceptibility were searched in 4 databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), and the Cochrane Library up to April 1, 2018. The odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate the strength of the associations. Subgroup analysis based on the ethnicity, studies with or without ischemic and valvular DCM was conducted. Publication bias detection was conducted using Begg test. Results: Nine papers detailing case-control studies were included, reporting a total of 1339 DCM cases and 1677 healthy controls. The meta-analysis results indicated that TNF -Œ± rs1800629 was associated with increased DCM susceptibility in the populations studied under the heterozygous model (AG vs GG: OR‚Ää=‚Ää1.91, 95% CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.05‚àí3.50, P =‚Ää.035) and dominant model (AG‚Ää+‚ÄäAA vs GG: OR‚Ää=‚Ää1.87, 95% CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.01‚àí3.45, P =‚Ää.046). In the subgroup analysis for ethnicity, rs1800629 polymorphism was significantly associated with the susceptibility of DCM for Asians under the 5 models (A vs G: OR‚Ää=‚Ää2.87, 95% CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.56‚àí5.30, P =‚Ää.001; AA vs GG: OR‚Ää=‚Ää3.95, 95% CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.13‚àí13.82, P‚Ää=‚Ää0.031; AG vs GG: OR‚Ää=‚Ää3.8, 95% CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.57‚àí9.19, P =‚Ää.003; AA vs GG‚Ää+‚ÄäAG: OR‚Ää=‚Ää2.51, 95% CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.41‚àí4.49, P =‚Ää.002; AG‚Ää+‚ÄäAA vs GG: OR‚Ää=‚Ää3.77, 95% CI‚Ää=‚Ää1.54‚àí9.20, P =‚Ää.004). Conclusion: There may be a moderate association between TNF -Œ± rs1800629 polymorphism and DCM susceptibility in the whole populations studied; however, TNF -Œ± rs1800629 polymorphism was significantly associated with the susceptibility of DCM for Asians, which indicates that such associations may be different between ethnicities.",Medicine,POPGENE
0.717463705,25426104,The importance of growth kinetic analysis in determining bacterial susceptibility against antibiotics and silver nanoparticles,"Routine antibiotics susceptibility testing still relies on standardized cultivation-based analyses, including measurement of inhibition zones in conventional agar diffusion tests and endpoint turbidity-based measurements. Here, we demonstrate that common off-line monitoring and endpoint determination after 18‚Äì24 h could be insufficient for reliable growth-dependent evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility. Different minimal inhibitory concentrations were obtained in 20- and 48 h microdilution plate tests using an Enterococcus faecium clinical isolate (strain UKI-MB07) as a model organism. Hence, we used an on-line kinetic assay for simultaneous cultivation and time-resolved growth analysis in a 96-well format instead of off-line susceptibility testing. Growth of the Enterococcus test organism was delayed up to 30 h in the presence of 0.25 Œºg mL -1 of vancomycin and 8 Œºg mL -1 of fosfomycin, after which pronounced growth was observed. Despite the delayed onset of growth, treatment with fosfomycin, daptomycin, fusidic acid, cefoxitin, or gentamicin resulted in higher maximum growth rates and/or higher final optical density values compared with antibiotic-free controls, indicating that growth stimulation and hormetic effects may occur with extended exposure to sublethal antibiotic concentrations. Whereas neither maximum growth rate nor final cell density correlated with antibiotic concentration, the lag phase duration for some antibiotics was a more meaningful indicator of dose-dependent growth inhibition. Our results also reveal that non-temporal growth profiles are only of limited value for cultivation-based antimicrobial silver nanoparticle susceptibility testing. The exposure to Ag(0) nanoparticles led to plasma membrane damage in a concentration-dependent manner and induced oxidative stress in Enterococcus faecium UKI-MB07, as shown by intracellular ROS accumulation.",Frontiers in microbiology,BIOCHEM

In this study, we used a single-trial electro-encephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coupling method which can analyze neural activity with both high temporal and high spatial resolution and thus assess the generation process of the MMN. We elicited the MMN with an auditory oddball paradigm while recording simultaneous EEG and fMRI. We divided the MMN into five equal-durational phases. Utilizing the single-trial variability of the MMN, we analyzed the neural generators of the five phases, thereby determining the spatiotemporal generation process of the MMN. We found two distinct bottom-up prediction error propagations: first from the auditory cortex to the motor areas and then from the auditory cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Our results support the regularity-violation hypothesis of MMN generation.",Frontiers in human neuroscience,NEURO

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of diathermocoagulation of telangiectasia on the nasal mucosa with a diode laser in the treatment of epistaxis in patients with HHT. From 2005 to 2010, 24 patients diagnosed with HHT and with mild-severe nosebleed were treated in our hospital with diode laser. Patients were given a pre- and post-operation evaluation questionnaire to determine the frequency and severity of nosebleed, the recurrence-free period of time after treatment and quality of life. We compared the pre- and post-operation haemoglobin values three months after the last treatment. After treatment, a decrease in the weekly frequency and entity of nosebleed was observed, together with substantial improvement in the quality of life and an increase in haematic haemoglobin. Diode laser treatment of telangiectasia on nasal mucosa represents a valuable, safe, effective and repeatable therapeutic option in treating mild and severe nosebleed, and it is associated with improvement in quality of life from psychological, social and clinical points of view.",Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale,CLINIC
0.38682598,30687559,Deep cover bleeder entry performance and support loading: A case study," Several questions have emerged in relation to deep cover bleeder entry performance and support loading: how well do current modeling procedures calculate the rear abutment extent and loading? Does an improved understanding of the rear abutment extent warrant a change in standing support in bleeder entries? To help answer these questions and to determine the current utilization of standing support in bleeder entries, four bleeder entries at varying distances from the startup room were instrumented, observed, and numerically modeled. This paper details observations made by NIOSH researchers in the bleeder entries of a deep cover longwall panel‚Äîspecifically data collected from instrumented pumpable cribs, observations of the conditions of the entries, and numerical modeling of the bleeder entries during longwall extraction. The primary focus was on the extent and magnitude of the abutment loading experienced by the standing support. As expected, the instrumentation of the standing supports showed very little loading relative to the capacity of the standing supports‚Äîless than 23 Mg load and 2.54 cm convergence. The Flac3D program was used to evaluate these four bleeder entries using previously defined modeling and input parameter estimation procedures. The results indicated only a minor increase in load during the extraction of the longwall panel. The model showed a much greater increase in stress due to the development of the gateroad and bleeder entries, with about 80% of the increase associated with development and 20% with longwall extraction. The Flac3D model showed very good correlation between expected gateroad loading during panel extraction and that expected based on previous studies. The results of this study showed that the rear abutment stress experienced by this bleeder entry design was minimal. The farther away from the startup room, the lower the applied load and smaller the convergence in the entry if all else is held constant. Finally, the numerical modeling method used in this study was capable of replicating the expected and measured results near seam. ",International journal of mining science and technology,ENG
0.347556361,30048590,"Bound Compound, Interfacial Water, and Phenyl Ring Rotation Dynamics of a Compound in the DNA Minor Groove"," DB2277, a heterocyclic diamidine, is a successful design for mixed base pair (bp) DNA sequence recognition. The compound has a central aza-benzimidazole group that forms two H-bonds with a GC bp that has flanking AT bps. The NMR structure of the DB2277-DNA complex with an AAGATA recognition site sequence was solved and here we report extended molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the structure. DB2277 has two terminal phenyl-amidine groups, one of which is directly linked to the DB2277 heterocyclic core while the other is linked through a flexible -OCH 2 - group. The flexibly-linked phenyl is too far from the minor groove floor to make direct H-bonds but it is linked to an AT bp through water-mediated H-bonds. The flexibly linked phenyl-amidine with water mediated H-bonds to the bases at the floor of the minor groove suggested that it might rotate in time-spans accessible in MD. To test this idea, we have conducted multi-microsecond MD simulations to determine if these phenyl rotations could be observed for a compound bound to DNA. In a 3 Œºs simulation, highly dynamic torsional motions were observed for the ‚ÄìOCH 2 ‚Äì linked phenyl but not for the other phenyl. The dynamics periodically reached a level to allow 180¬∞ rotation of the phenyl while still bound in the minor groove. This is the first observation of rotation of a phenyl bound to DNA and the results provide mechanistic details of how a rotation can occur as well as how mixed bp recognition can occur for monomer compounds bound to the minor groove.

There is a need to identify which youth are at greatest risk for disorder onset in this population.    Objective  This study prospectively examined several theory-based family and parent characteristics (e. g., family conflict, parental over-control, parental psychopathology) as predictors of anxiety disorder onset in children whose parents were clinically anxious.    Methods  Families were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial evaluating a familybased preventative intervention, relative to an information monitoring control condition, for offspring of anxious parents (N= 136; child mean age 8.69 years; 55% female; 85% Caucasian). Family and parent measures were collected using multiple informants and an observational task at baseline, post-intervention, and at a six and 12 month followup. Child anxiety disorder diagnosis was determined by independent evaluators using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children.    Results  Results indicated that none of the baseline family or parent variables examined predicted the onset of an anxiety disorder in children over the one year follow-up period.    Conclusions  Findings raise questions about the short-term risk associated with family and parent factors in anxiety disorder development in this high risk population.

0.234778901,20197764,Gene expression in histologically normal epithelium from breast cancer patients and from cancer-free prophylactic mastectomy patients shares a similar profile,"Introduction: We hypothesised that gene expression in histologically normal (HN) epithelium (NlEpi) would differ between breast cancer patients and usual-risk controls undergoing reduction mammoplasty (RM), and that gene expression in NlEpi from cancer-free prophylactic mastectomy (PM) samples from high-risk women would resemble HN gene expression. Methods: We analysed gene expression in 73 NlEpi samples microdissected from frozen tissue. In 42 samples, we used microarrays to compare gene expression between 18 RM patients and 18 age-matched HN (9 oestrogen receptor (ER)+, 9 ER‚àí) and 6 PM patients. Data were analysed using a Bayesian approach (BADGE), and validated with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in 31 independent NlEpi samples from 8 RM, 17 HN, and 6 PM patients. Results: A total of 98 probe sets (86 genes) were differentially expressed between RM and HN samples. Performing hierarchical analysis with these 98 probe sets, PM and HN samples clustered together, away from RM samples. qPCR validation of independent samples was high (84%) and uniform in RM compared with HN patients, and lower (58%), but more heterogeneous, in RM compared with PM patients. The 86 genes were implicated in many processes including transcription and the MAPK pathway. Conclusion: Gene expression differs between the NlEpi of breast cancer cases and controls. The profile of cancer cases can be discerned in high-risk NlEpi from cancer-free breasts. This suggests that the profile is not an effect of the tumour, but may mark increased risk and reveal the earliest genomic changes of breast cancer.",British journal of cancer,ONCO
0.062826846,25497088,HSV-1 Remodels Host Telomeres To Facilitate Viral Replication," Summary  Telomeres protect the ends of cellular chromosomes. We show here that infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) results in chromosomal structural aberrations at telomeres and the accumulation of telomere dysfunction-induced DNA damage foci (TIFs). At the molecular level, HSV-1 induces transcription of telomere repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), followed by the proteolytic degradation of the telomere protein TPP1, and loss of the telomere repeat DNA signal. The HSV-1 encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0 is required for TERRA transcription and facilitates TPP1 degradation. shRNA depletion of TPP1 increases viral replication, arguing that TPP1inhibits viral replication. Viral replication protein ICP8 forms foci that coincide with telomeric proteins and ICP8 null virus failed to degrade telomere DNA signal. These findings suggest that HSV-1 reorganizes telomeres to form ICP8-associated pre-replication foci and promotes viral genomic replication. ",Cell reports,BIOCHEM

Accumulated in secretory cavities, most components of these oils are volatile terpenes. They contribute to defense against herbivores and pathogens, and perhaps also protect tissues against abiotic stress. In spite of their importance, our understanding of the physiological, biochemical, and genetic regulation of citrus terpene volatiles is still limited. The availability of the sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) genome sequence allowed us to characterize for the first time the terpene synthase (TPS) family in a citrus type.

The Urea Cycle Disorders Longitudinal Study is a natural history study that collects data from regular clinical follow-up and neuropsychological testing. This report examines links between biochemical markers (ammonia, glutamine, arginine, citrulline) and primary neuropsychological endpoints in 3 distal disorders, argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency (ASD or citrullinemia type I), argininosuccinic acid lyase deficiency (ASA or ALD) and arginase deficiency (ARGD). Laboratory results and test scores from neuropsychological evaluations were assessed in 145 study participants, ages 3 years and older, with ASD (n=64), ASA (n=65) and ARGD (n=16). Mean full scale IQ was below the population mean of 100 ¬± 15 for all groups: (ASD = 79 ¬± 24; ASA = 71 ¬± 21; ARGD = 65 ¬± 19). The greatest deficits were noted in visual performance and motor skills for all groups. While ammonia levels remain prominent as prognostic biomarkers, other biomarkers may be equally valuable as correlates of neuropsychological functioning. Cumulative exposure to the biomarkers included in the study proved to be highly sensitive indicators of neuropsychological outcomes, even when below the cut-off levels generally considered toxic. Blood levels of biomarkers obtained on the day of neuropsychological evaluations were not correlated with measures of functioning for any disorder in any domain. The importance of cumulative exposure supports early identification and confirms the need for well-controlled management of all biochemical abnormalities (and not just ammonia) that occur in urea cycle disorders.

Although autoregulation of mazEF expression through the MazE antitoxin-dependent transcriptional repression has been biochemically characterized, less is known about post-transcriptional autoregulation, as well as how both of these autoregulatory features affect growth of single cells during conditions that promote MazF production. Here, we demonstrate post-transcriptional autoregulation of mazF expression dynamics by MazF cleaving its own transcript. Single-cell analyses of bacterial populations during ectopic MazF production indicated that two-level autoregulation of mazEF expression influences cell-to-cell growth rate heterogeneity. The increase in growth rate heterogeneity is governed by the MazE antitoxin, and tuned by the MazF-dependent mazF mRNA cleavage. Also, both autoregulatory features grant rapid exit from the stress caused by mazF overexpression. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that MazF-mediated cleavage of mazF mRNA leads to increased temporal variability in length of individual cells during ectopic mazF overexpression, as explained by a stochastic model indicating that mazEF mRNA cleavage underlies temporal fluctuations in MazF levels during stress.",Nucleic acids research,BIOCHEM

Purpose Cancer patients are often aged and are further weakened by their illness and treatments. Our goal was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of using minimally invasive techniques to operate on spinal fractures in these patients. Overview of Literature Vertebroplasty is now considered to be a safe technique that allows a significant reduction of the pain induced by a spinal tumoral fracture. However, few papers describe the kyphosis reduction that can be achieved by combining percutaneous fixation and anterior vertebral reconstruction. Methods We studied 35 patients seen between December 2013 and October 2016 who had at least one pathological spinal fracture and multiple vertebral metastases. The population‚Äôs mean age was 67 years, and no patients included had preoperative neurological deficits. The patients underwent a minimally invasive surgery consisting of a percutaneous pedicular fixation with cement-enhanced screws and anterior reconstruction comprising kyphoplasty when possible or corpectomy in cases of excessive damage to the vertebral body. Back pain, traumatic local and regional kyphosis, and Beck‚Äôs Index were collected pre- and postoperatively, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Results Mean follow-up time was 13.4 months. Significant reductions in back pain ( p <0.001) and local ( p <0.001) and regional kyphosis ( p =0.006) were found at the 6-month follow-up (alpha risk level <0.05). Beck‚Äôs Index was also significantly increased, indicating good restoration of the anterior vertebral height. By the final follow-up, no screws had fallen/pulled out. There were no infectious or neurological complications. Conclusions Percutaneous cement-enhanced fixation for pathological fractures has proven a safe and efficient technique in our experience, enabling weak patients to rapidly become ambulatory again without complications. Further follow-up of the patients is necessary to assess the long-term effects of this technique and the continued quality of life of our patients.",Asian spine journal,CLINIC
0.794125385,29191194,"Integrating herbal medicine into mainstream healthcare in Ghana: clients‚Äô acceptability, perceptions and disclosure of use","Background Although there are current efforts to integrate herbal medicine (HM) into mainstream healthcare in Ghana, there is paucity of empirical evidence on the acceptability and concurrent use of HM, in the formal health facilities in Ghana. This study sought to determine client perception, disclosure and acceptability of integrating herbal medicine in mainstream healthcare in Kumasi, Ghana. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from May to August, 2015. Five hundred patients presenting at the outpatient departments of Kumasi South, Suntreso and Tafo Government Hospitals in Kumasi were randomly selected. Interviews were conducted with the use of structured questionnaires. A logistic regression analysis, using backward selection, was conducted to determine the influence of socio-demographic and facility related factors on the odds of using HM at the facility. All statistical tests were two-sided and considered significant at a p -value of <0.05. Results Majority of the study respondents were females (64.8%) and the median age was 36¬†years. Less than half, 42.2%, of the respondents utilized HM services when they visited the health facility. Reasons for using HM at the facility level included ‚Äòbeing effective‚Äô (24.4%), ‚Äòeasy to access‚Äô (25.3%) and ‚Äòbeing comparatively cheaper‚Äô (16%). About 86% never disclosed previous use of HM to their health care providers. Socio-economic status and perception of service provision influenced use of herbal medicines. Respondents who rated themselves wealthy had increased odds of using herbal medicines at the health facility as compared to those who rated themselves poor (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.9; 95%CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.6‚Äì15.3).

The ROC characteristics of both methods were then validated in an independent database of 324 patients enrolled in European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer Phase I trials of cytotoxic agents between 2000 and 2009. Results: The CHAID method identified high-risk patients as those with albumin <33‚Äâg‚Äâl ‚àí1 or ‚©æ33‚Äâg‚Äâl ‚àí1 , but platelet counts ‚©æ400.000‚Äâmm ‚àí3 . In the validation data set, the rates of correctly classified patients were 0.79 vs 0.67 for the CHAID model and RMS, respectively. The negative predictive values (NPV) were similar for the CHAID model and RMS. Conclusion: The CHAID model and RMS provided a similarly high level of NPV, but the CHAID model gave a better accuracy in the validation set. Both CHAID model and RMS may improve the screening process in phase I trials.",British journal of cancer,ONCO
0.724568608,30060864,Links between Childhood Exposure to Violent Contexts and Risky Adolescent Health Behaviors,"  Purpose  To assess whether childhood exposure to violent contexts is prospectively associated with risky adolescent health behavior and whether these associations are specific to different contexts of violence and different types of risky behavior.    Methods  Data come from 2,684 adolescents in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a population-based, birth cohort study of children born between 1998‚Äì2000 in 20 large American cities. Using logistic regression models, we evaluate whether exposure to 6 indicators of community violence and 7 indicators of family violence at ages 5 and 9 is associated with risky sexual behavior, substance use, and obesity risk behavior at age 15.    Results  Controlling for a range of adolescent, parent, and neighborhood covariates, each additional point on the community violence scale is associated with 8% higher odds of risky sexual behavior but not substance use or obesity risk behavior. Alternatively, each additional point on the family violence scale is associated with 20% higher odds of substance use but not risky sexual behavior or obesity risk behavior.    Conclusions  Childhood exposure to violent contexts is associated with risky adolescent health behaviors, but the associations are context and behavior specific. After including covariates, we find no association between childhood exposure to violent contexts and obesity risk behavior.

0.866106803,24353709,Diabetes education improves depressive state in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes," Objectives: The prevalence of depression is relatively high in individuals with diabetes. However, screening and monitoring of depressive state in patients with diabetes is still neglected in developing countries and the treatment of diabetes-related depression is rarely performed in these countries. In this study, our aim was to study the role of diabetes education in the improvement of depressive state in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes.  Methods: The Dutch version of the center for epidemiological studies depression scale (CES-D scale) and the problem areas in diabetes (PAID) questionnaire were used to assess depression and diabetes-specific emotional distress in 1200 newly diagnosed male adult patients with type 2 diabetes before and after a two-week diabetes education by professionally trained nurses. Pearson correlation and regression analysis were used to analyze the factors related to depression in patients with type 2 diabetes.  Results: The incidence of depression in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes was 28%, and the rate of diabetes-specific emotional distress was 65.5%. High education levels, low income were correlated to depression in individuals with diabetes. After two weeks of diabetes education, the incidence of depression and diabetes-specific emotional distress decreased significantly to 20.5% (P < 0.05) and 11% (P < 0.001), respectively.  Conclusions: The incidence of depression, especially diabetes-specific emotional distress, was relatively high in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes. The depression state could be improved by diabetes education.",Pakistan journal of medical sciences,CLINIC
0.349862096,24096125,Sparse canonical correlation analysis relates network-level atrophy to multivariate cognitive measures in a neurodegenerative population," This study establishes that sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCAN) identifies generalizable, structural MRI-derived cortical networks that relate to five distinct categories of cognition. We obtain multivariate psychometrics from the domain-specific sub-scales of the Philadelphia Brief Assessment of Cognition (PBAC). By using a training and separate testing stage, we find that PBAC-defined cognitive domains of language, visuospatial functioning, episodic memory, executive control, and social functioning correlate with unique and distributed areas of gray matter (GM). In contrast, a parallel univariate framework fails to identify, from the training data, regions that are also significant in the left-out test dataset. The cohort includes164 patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, nonfluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, or corticobasal syndrome. The analysis is implemented with open-source software for which we provide examples in the text. In conclusion, we show that multivariate techniques identify biologically-plausible brain regions supporting specific cognitive domains. The findings are identified in training data and confirmed in test data. ",NeuroImage,NEURO

0.123080949,27920557,Effect of smoking on the genetic makeup of toll-like receptors 2 and 6,"Background Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, asthma, and oral cancer, and is central to the altered innate immune responsiveness to infection. Many hypotheses have provided evidence that cigarette smoking induces more genetic changes in genes involved in the development of many cigarette-related diseases. This alteration may be from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in innate immunity genes, especially the toll-like receptors (TLRs). Objective In this study, the genotype frequencies of TLR2 and TLR6 in smoking and nonsmoking population were examined. Methods Saliva samples were collected from 177 smokers and 126 nonsmokers. The SNPs used were rs3804100 (1350 T/C, Ser450Ser) and rs3804099 (597 T/C, Asn199Asn) for TLR2 and rs3796508 (979 G/A, Val327Met) and rs5743810 (745 T/C, Ser249Pro) for TLR6. Results Results showed that TLR2 rs3804100 has a significant effect in short-term smokers (OR =2.63; P =0.04), and this effect is not observed in long-term smokers (>5 years of smoking). Therefore, this early mutation may be repaired by the DNA repair system. For TLR2 rs3804099, the variation in genotype frequencies between the smokers and control patients was due to a late mutation, and its protective role appears only in long-term smokers (OR =0.40, P =0.018). In TLR6 rs5743810, the TT genotype is significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers (OR =6.90). The effect of this SNP is observed in long-term smokers, regardless of the smoking regime per day. Conclusion TLR2 (rs3804100 and rs3804099) and TLR6 (rs5743810) can be used as a potential index in the diagnosis and prevention of more diseases caused by smoking.",OncoTargets and therapy,POPGENE

This is the first study to strictly control for LDF variability in determining the value of serial, basal (unprovoked) skin LDF as a practical method to assess resolution of acute pain crisis in sickle cell patients. Daily LDF measurements were repeated on the exact same skin areas of the calf and forehead throughout each of 12 hospital admissions for uncomplicated acute pain crisis.  A progressive increase in perfusion was observed in the calf throughout hospitalization as pain crisis resolved, but measurement reproducibility in the calf was poor. Reproducibility in the forehead was better, but no significant trend over time in perfusion was seen. There was no significant correlation between perfusion and pain scores over time. There was also no significant pattern of LDF oscillations over time.  In conclusion, only perfusion units and not oscillatory pattern of LDF has probable pathophysiological significance in sickle cell disease vaso-occlusion. The reproducibility of basal skin LDF specifically in sickle cell disease needs to be confirmed. ","Blood cells, molecules & diseases",CLINIC

0.783529729,30103847,Defect of SIRT1-FoxO3a axis is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species during protein kinase CK2 downregulation-mediated cellular senescence and nematode aging,"We investigated whether SIRT1 is associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation during CK2 downregulation-mediated senescence. SIRT1 overexpression suppressed ROS accumulation, reduced transcription of FoxO3a target genes, and nuclear export and acetylation of FoxO3a, which were induced by CK2 downregulation in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells. Conversely, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant SIRT1 (H363Y) counteracted decreased ROS levels, increased transcriptional activity of FoxO3a, and increased nuclear import and decreased acetylation of FoxO3a, which were induced by CK2 upregulation. CK2 downregulation destabilized SIRT1 protein via an ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in human cells, whereas CK2 overexpression reduced ubiquitination of SIRT1. Finally, the SIRT1 activator resveratrol attenuated the accumulation of ROS and lipofuscin as well as lifespan shortening, and reduced expression of the DAF-16 target gene sod-3 , which were induced by CK2 downregulation in nematodes. Altogether, this study demonstrates that inactivation of the SIRT1‚ÄìFoxO3a axis, at least in part, is involved in ROS generation during CK2 downregulation-mediated cellular senescence and nematode aging.",BMB reports,BIOCHEM
0.927428963,28194222,Intelligibility Evaluation of Pathological Speech through Multigranularity Feature Extraction and Optimization,"Pathological speech usually refers to speech distortion resulting from illness or other biological insults. The assessment of pathological speech plays an important role in assisting the experts, while automatic evaluation of speech intelligibility is difficult because it is usually nonstationary and mutational. In this paper, we carry out an independent innovation of feature extraction and reduction, and we describe a multigranularity combined feature scheme which is optimized by the hierarchical visual method. A novel method of generating feature set based on S -transform and chaotic analysis is proposed. There are BAFS (430, basic acoustics feature), local spectral characteristics MSCC (84, Mel S -transform cepstrum coefficients), and chaotic features (12). Finally, radar chart and F -score are proposed to optimize the features by the hierarchical visual fusion. The feature set could be optimized from 526 to 96 dimensions based on NKI-CCRT corpus and 104 dimensions based on SVD corpus. The experimental results denote that new features by support vector machine (SVM) have the best performance, with a recognition rate of 84.4% on NKI-CCRT corpus and 78.7% on SVD corpus. The proposed method is thus approved to be effective and reliable for pathological speech intelligibility evaluation.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,CS
0.393407272,26682488,Depressive symptoms and decision-making preferences in patients with comorbid illnesses,"  Objective  Shared decision-making (SDM) is increasingly promoted in the primary care setting, but depressive symptoms, which are associated with cognitive changes, may influence decision-making preferences. We sought to assess whether elevated depressive symptoms are associated with decision-making preference in patients with comorbid chronic illness.    Methods  We enrolled 195 patients ‚â•18 years old with uncontrolled hypertension from two urban, academic primary care clinics. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Clinician-directed decision-making preference was assessed according to the Control Preference Scale. The impact of depressive symptoms on decision-making preference was assessed using generalized linear mixed models adjusted for age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, Medicaid status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, partner status, and clustering within clinicians.    Results  The mean age was 64.2 years; 72% were women, 77% Hispanic, 38% Black, and 33% had elevated depressive symptoms. Overall, 35% of patients preferred clinician-directed decision-making, 19% mostly clinician-directed, 39% shared, and 7% some or little clinician-input. Patients with (vs. without) elevated depressive symptoms were more likely to prefer clinician-directed decision-making (46% versus 29%; p=0.02; AOR 2.51, 95%CI 1.30‚Äì4.85, p=0.005). Remitted depressive symptoms (vs. never depressed) were not associated with preference.    Conclusions  Elevated depressive symptoms are associated with preference for clinician-directed decision-making. We suggest that clinicians should be aware of this effect when incorporating preference into their communication styles and take an active role in eliciting patient values and exchanging information about treatment choice, all important components of shared decision-making, particularly when patients are depressed.

0.138274183,16604158,A Model for Integrating Elementary Neural Functions into Delayed-Response Behavior,"It is well established that various cortical regions can implement a wide array of neural processes, yet the mechanisms which integrate these processes into behavior-producing, brain-scale activity remain elusive. We propose that an important role in this respect might be played by executive structures controlling the traffic of information between the cortical regions involved. To illustrate this hypothesis, we present a neural network model comprising a set of interconnected structures harboring stimulus-related activity (visual representation, working memory, and planning), and a group of executive units with task-related activity patterns that manage the information flowing between them. The resulting dynamics allows the network to perform the dual task of either retaining an image during a delay (delayed-matching to sample task), or recalling from this image another one that has been associated with it during training (delayed-pair association task). The model reproduces behavioral and electrophysiological data gathered on the inferior temporal and prefrontal cortices of primates performing these same tasks. It also makes predictions on how neural activity coding for the recall of the image associated with the sample emerges and becomes prospective during the training phase. The network dynamics proves to be very stable against perturbations, and it exhibits signs of scale-invariant organization and cooperativity. The present network represents a possible neural implementation for active, top-down, prospective memory retrieval in primates. The model suggests that brain activity leading to performance of cognitive tasks might be organized in modular fashion, simple neural functions becoming integrated into more complex behavior by executive structures harbored in prefrontal cortex and/or basal ganglia. Synopsis Before we do anything, our brain must construct neural representations of the operations required. Imaging and recording techniques are indeed providing ever more detailed insight into how different regions of the brain contribute to behavior. However, it has remained elusive exactly how these various regions then come to cooperate with each other, thus organizing the brain-scale activity patterns needed for even the simplest planned tasks. In the present work, the authors propose a neural network model built around the hypothesis of a modular organization of brain activity, where relatively autonomous basic neural functions useful at a given moment are recruited and integrated into actual behavior. At the heart of the model are regulating structures that restrain information from flowing freely between the different cortical areas involved, releasing it instead in a controlled fashion able to produce the appropriate response. The dynamics of the network, simulated on a computer, enables it to pass simple cognitive tests while reproducing data gathered on primates carrying out these same tasks. This suggests that the model might constitute an appropriate framework for studying the neural basis of more general behavior.",PLoS computational biology,CS
0.570581967,28691711,Generation and comparison of CRISPR-Cas9 and Cre-mediated genetically engineered mouse models of sarcoma,"Genetically engineered mouse models that employ site-specific recombinase technology are important tools for cancer research but can be costly and time-consuming. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been adapted to generate autochthonous tumours in mice, but how these tumours compare to tumours generated by conventional recombinase technology remains to be fully explored. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 to generate multiple subtypes of primary sarcomas efficiently in wild type and genetically engineered mice. These data demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to generate multiple subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas in mice. Primary sarcomas generated with CRISPR-Cas9 and Cre recombinase technology had similar histology, growth kinetics, copy number variation and mutational load as assessed by whole exome sequencing. These results show that sarcomas generated with CRISPR-Cas9 technology are similar to sarcomas generated with conventional modelling techniques and suggest that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to more rapidly generate genotypically and phenotypically similar cancers. Site-specific recombination and CRISPR-Cas9 have been used to generate genetically engineered mouse models of cancer. Here the authors compare sarcomas generated using both systems and see similar genetic and cellular phenotypes, suggesting CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to rapidly generate sarcoma models.",Nature communications,ENG
0.249475298,31288787,Effect of dialysate potassium and lactate on serum potassium and bicarbonate concentrations during daily hemodialysis at low dialysate flow rates,"Background Observational studies of hemodialysis patients treated thrice weekly have shown that serum and dialysate potassium and bicarbonate concentrations are associated with patient outcomes. The effect of more frequent hemodialysis on serum potassium and bicarbonate concentrations has rarely been studied, especially for treatments at low dialysate flow rate. Methods These post-hoc analyses evaluated data from patients who transferred from in-center hemodialysis (HD) to daily HD at low dialysate flow rates during the FREEDOM Study. The primary outcomes were the change in predialysis serum potassium and bicarbonate concentrations after transfer from in-center HD (mean during the last 3‚Äâmonths) to daily HD (mean during the first 3‚Äâmonths). Results After transfer from in-center HD to daily HD (data from 345 patients, 51‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ15‚Äâyears of age, mean‚Äâ¬±‚Äâstandard deviation), predialysis serum potassium decreased ( P <‚Äâ0.001) by approximately 0.4‚ÄâmEq/L when dialysate potassium concentration during daily HD was 1‚ÄâmEq/L; no change occurred when dialysate potassium concentration during daily HD was 2‚ÄâmEq/L. After transfer from in-center HD to daily HD (data from 284 patients, 51‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ15‚Äâyears of age), predialysis serum bicarbonate concentration decreased ( P =‚Äâ0.0022) by 1.0‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.3‚ÄâmEq/L when dialysate lactate concentration was 40‚ÄâmEq/L but increased ( P <‚Äâ0.001) by 2.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.5‚ÄâmEq/L when dialysate lactate concentration was 45‚ÄâmEq/L. These relationships were dependent on serum potassium and bicarbonate concentrations during in-center HD. Conclusions Control of serum potassium and bicarbonate concentrations during daily HD at low dialysate flow rates is readily achievable; the choice of dialysate potassium and lactate concentration can be informed when transfer is from in-center HD to daily HD.

There are no prospective data regarding the management of pulmonary cryptococcosis in the immunocompetent patient. Clinical guidelines recommend oral fluconazole for patients with mild to moderate symptoms and amphotericin B plus flucytosine followed by fluconazole for severe disease. It is unclear whether patients who have histological evidence of Cryptococcus neoformans but negative cultures will even respond to drug treatment. We evaluated and managed a patient whose presentation and course raised important questions regarding the significance of negative cultures, antifungal choices, duration of therapy, and resolution of clinical, serologic, and radiographic findings. Methods. In addition to our experience, to answer these questions we reviewed available case reports and case series regarding immunocompetent patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis for the last 55 years using the following definitions: Definite - Clinical and/or radiographic findings of pulmonary infection and respiratory tract isolation of C. neoformans without other suspected etiologies; Probable - Clinical and radiographic findings of pulmonary infection, histopathologic evidence of C. neoformans , and negative fungal cultures with or without a positive cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen. Results. Pulmonary cryptococcosis resolves in most patients with or without specific antifungal therapy. Clinical, radiographic, and serologic resolution is slow and may take years. Conclusions. Persistently positive antigen titers are most common in untreated patients and may remain strongly positive despite complete or partial resolution of disease.

Methods The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles and Illumina-based metagenomic sequencing on colon contents of 15 semi-domestic yaks were investigated. Unweighted pairwise grouping method with mathematical averages (UPGMA) clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to analyze the DGGE fingerprint. The Illumina sequences were assembled, predicted to genes and functionally annotated, and then classified by querying protein sequences of the genes against the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) database. Results Metagenomic sequencing showed that more than 85% of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences belonged to the phylum Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes , indicating that the family Ruminococcaceae (46.5%), Rikenellaceae (11.3%), Lachnospiraceae (10.0%), and Bacteroidaceae (6.3%) were dominant gut microbes. Over 50% of non-rRNA gene sequences represented the metabolic pathways of amino acids (14.4%), proteins (12.3%), sugars (11.9%), nucleotides (6.8%), lipids (1.7%), xenobiotics (1.4%), coenzymes, and vitamins (3.6%). Gene functional classification showed that most of enzyme-coding genes were related to cellulose digestion and amino acids metabolic pathways. Conclusion Yaks‚Äô age had a substantial effect on gut microbial composition.

To do this 3-D-radiative transfer model was adapted for actinic flux calculations in mountainous terrain and the maps of the actinic flux field at the surface, calculated with the 3-D-radiative transfer model, are given. The differences between the 3-D- and 1-D-model results for selected days during the campaigns are shown, together with the ratios of the modeled actinic flux values to the measurements. In many cases the 1-D-model overestimates actinic flux by more than the measurement uncertainty of 10%. The results of using a 3-D-model generally show significantly lower values, and can underestimate the actinic flux by up to 30%. This case study attempts to quantify the impact of snow cover in combination with topography on spectral actinic flux. The impact of snow cover on the actinic flux was ~¬†25% in narrow snow covered valleys, but for snow free areas there were no significant changes due snow cover in the surrounding area and it is found that the effect snow-cover at distances over 5¬†km from the point of interest was below 5%.

0.696992443,30305047,Transcriptome analysis of radish sprouts hypocotyls reveals the regulatory role of hydrogen-rich water in anthocyanin biosynthesis under UV-A,"Background Hydrogen gas (H 2 ) is the most abundant element in the universe, and has been reported to act as a novel beneficial gaseous molecule in plant adaptive responses. Radish sprouts are popular because they contain substantial amounts of antioxidants and health-promoting compounds, such as anthocyanin and glucosinolates. Although radish sprouts accumulated more anthocyanin under UV-A after treatment with hydrogen-rich water (HRW), the molecular mechanism responsible is still elusive. To explore these mechanisms, RNA-seq analysis was used. Results Four cDNA libraries from radish sprout hypocotyls were constructed, and a total of 14,564 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through pairwise comparisons. By Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, these unigenes were found to be implicated in light signal perception and transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism, photosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex accounted for the majority of the transcription factors found to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, and levels of transcripts for this complex were in accordance with the anthocyanin concentrations observed. In addition, other transcription factors (such as NAC, bZIP and TCP) might participate in HRW-promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the signaling processes of plant hormones, MAPKs and Ca 2+ might be involved in HRW-promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis under UV-A. The expression patterns of 16 selected genes were confirmed using qRT-PCR analysis. Conclusions Taken together, the results of this study may expand our understanding of HRW-promoted anthocyanin accumulation under UV-A in radish sprouts.

The aim of this study was to determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human SH2B gene are associated with these variables. A tagging SNP, Ala484Thr (rs7498665) was selected to represent five common SNPs (minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05) in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a 16 kb region encompassing the SH2B gene. The tSNP was genotyped in 2455 Caucasian female twins (mean age 47.4¬±12.6 years) from the St Thomas‚Äô UK Adult Twin Registry (Twins UK). Ala484Thr (minor allele frequency 0.38) was associated with serum leptin, total fat, waist circumference and body weight (Ps=0.02‚Äì0.04). The coding SNP has no predicted effect on protein structure or function and is likely to be in LD with an as yet unidentified functional variant in the SH2B gene. Our results support a role for SH2-B in modulating the regulation of body weight and fat by leptin in this female population. If SH2-B signalling is attenuated in diet-induced obesity, it could become a target for drug-induced leptin sensitization. ","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",POPGENE

In these studies, either sample sizes were too low when genetic and acoustic or morphological data were gathered on the same individuals, or genetic and other data were collected on different individuals. In this study, we intensively sampled bats in 4 caves and combined all approaches in order to analyse genetic, morphologic, and acoustic divergence between these lineages that live in the same caves in French Guiana. Results A multiplex of 20 polymorphic microsatellite markers was developed using the 454-pyrosequencing technique to investigate for the first time the extent of reproductive isolation between the two lineages and the population genetic structure within lineages. We genotyped 748 individuals sampled between 2010 and 2015 at the 20 nuclear microsatellite loci and sequenced a portion of the cytochrome c oxydase I gene in a subset of these. Two distinct, non-overlapping haplogroups corresponding to cryptic species P. alitonus and P. rubiginosus were revealed, in accordance with previous findings. No spatial genetic structure between caves was detected for both species. Hybridization appeared to be quite limited (0.1‚Äì4%) using microsatellite markers whereas introgression was more common (7.5%) and asymmetric for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Conclusions The extremely low rate of hybridization could be explained by differences in life cycle phenology between species as well as morphological and acoustical distinction between sexes in one or the other species. Taken together, these results add to our growing understanding of the nature of species boundaries in Pteronotus parnelli , but deserve more in-depth studies to understand the evolutionary processes underlying asymmetric mtDNA introgression in this group of cryptic species.

0.123772537,31340153,Single-Cell Analysis Suggests that Ongoing Affinity Maturation Drives the Emergence of Pemphigus Vulgaris Autoimmune Disease," SUMMARY  Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune disease characterized by blistering sores on skin and mucosal membranes, caused by autoantibodies primarily targeting the cellular adhesion protein, desmoglein-3 (Dsg3). To better understand how Dsg3-specific autoantibodies develop and cause disease in humans, we performed a cross-sectional study of PV patients before and after treatment to track relevant cellular responses underlying disease pathogenesis, and we provide an in-depth analysis of two patients by generating a panel of mAbs from single Dsg3-specific memory B cells (MBCs). Additionally, we analyzed a paired sample from one patient collected 15-months prior to disease diagnosis. We find that Dsg3-specific MBCs have an activated phenotype and show signs of ongoing affinity maturation and clonal selection. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with pathogenic activity primarily target epitopes in the extracellular domains EC1 and EC2 of Dsg3, though they can also bind to the EC4 domain. Combining antibodies targeting different epitopes synergistically enhances in vitro pathogenicity.   Graphical Abstract      In Brief  Cho et al. use single-cell sorting methods to detect and characterize autoantigen-specific memory B cells before and during the development of pemphigus vulgaris disease. They find that memory B cells undergo ongoing affinity maturation to generate a limited repertoire or pathogenic antibodies, which work synergistically to enhance overall pathogenic activity.

0.031030218,30424089,Electroosmotic Flow of Viscoelastic Fluid in a Nanoslit,"The electroosmotic flow (EOF) of viscoelastic fluid in a long nanoslit is numerically studied to investigate the rheological property effect of Linear Phan-Thien-Tanner (LPTT) fluid on the fully developed EOF. The non-linear Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations governing the electric potential and the ionic concentration distribution within the channel are adopted to take into account the effect of the electrical double layer (EDL), including the EDL overlap. When the EDL is not overlapped, the velocity profiles for both Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids are plug-like and increase sharply near the charged wall. The velocity profile resembles that of pressure-driven flow when the EDL is overlapped. Regardless of the EDL thickness, apparent increase of velocity is obtained for viscoelastic fluid of larger Weissenberg number compared to the Newtonian fluid, indicating the shear thinning behavior of the LPTT fluid. The effect of the Weissenberg number on the velocity distribution is less significant as the degree of EDL overlapping increases, due to the overall decrease of the shear rate. The increase (decrease) of polymer extensibility (viscosity ratio) also enhances the EOF of viscoelastic fluid.",Micromachines,ENG
0.612743205,23129174,Patients‚Äô Willingness to Participate in a Breast Cancer Biobank at Screening Mammogram,"  Purpose  To characterize patients‚Äô willingness to donate a biospecimen for future research as part of a breast cancer-related biobank involving a general screening population.    Materials and Methods  We performed a prospective cross-sectional study of 4,217 women aged 21 to 89 years presenting to our facilities for screening mammogram between December 2010 and October 2011. This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by our institutional review board. We collected data on patients‚Äô interest in and actual donation of a biospecimen, motivators and barriers to donating, demographic information, and personal breast cancer risk factors. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify patient-level characteristics associated with an increased likelihood to donate.    Results  Mean patient age was 57.8 years (SD 11.1 years). While 66.0% (2785/4217) of patients were willing to donate blood or saliva during their visit, only 56.4% (2378/4217) actually donated. Women with a college education (OR=1.27, p=0.003), older age (OR=1.02, p<0.001), previous breast biopsy (OR=1.23, p=0.012), family history of breast cancer (OR=1.23, p=0.004), or a comorbidity (OR=1.22, p=0.014) were more likely to donate. Asian-American women were significantly less likely to donate (OR=0.74, p=0.005). The major reason for donating was to help all future patients (42.3%) and the major reason for declining donation was privacy concerns (22.3%).    Conclusion  A large proportion of women participating in a breast cancer screening registry are willing to donate blood or saliva to a biobank. Among minority participants, Asian-American women are less likely to donate and further qualitative research is required to identify novel active recruitment strategies to ensure their involvement.

0.430427014,23543832,Effects of a Novel Push-through Technique Using the Implantable Collamer Lens Injector System for Graft Delivery during Endothelial Keratoplasty,"Purpose To investigate effects of a new push-through insertion method for donor lenticules using an injector system on endothelial viability ex vivo and in a clinical case series of endothelial keratoplasty. Methods An ex vivo delivery model was used with porcine corneoscleral rims. We compared the endothelial viability in a new push-through insertion method using the Visian Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) injector versus that of standard forceps-assisted insertion for lenticule delivery. Twenty porcine corneal lenticules were divided into four groups by insertion method and wound size. Vital dye staining was performed and devitalized areas were semi-quantitatively assessed by digital imaging. In the clinical case series, Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) using the push-through method was performed in seven patients and endothelial outcome was determined six months postoperatively. Results Mean devitalized areas for the push-through method were significantly lower than for forceps-assisted insertion through 3.2 mm incision (23.99 ¬± 2.17% vs. 50.48 ¬± 5.07%, p = 0.009) in the ex vivo model. Average endothelial cell counts of donor tissues of patients who underwent DSEK were 26.4% lower six months postoperatively. Conclusions Push-through delivery of donor lenticules using the Visian ICL injector system appears to be less harmful to endothelial cells than conventional forceps-assisted delivery.",Korean journal of ophthalmology : KJO,ENG
0.491020504,31253090,"Odyssey : a semi-automated pipeline for phasing, imputation, and analysis of genome-wide genetic data","Background Genome imputation, admixture resolution and genome-wide association analyses are timely and computationally intensive processes with many composite and requisite steps. Analysis time increases further when building and installing the run programs required for these analyses. For scientists that may not be as versed in programing language, but want to perform these operations hands on, there is a lengthy learning curve to utilize the vast number of programs available for these analyses. Results In an effort to streamline the entire process with easy-to-use steps for scientists working with big data, the Odyssey pipeline was developed. Odyssey is a simplified, efficient, semi-automated genome-wide imputation and analysis pipeline, which prepares raw genetic data, performs pre-imputation quality control, phasing, imputation, post-imputation quality control, population stratification analysis, and genome-wide association with statistical data analysis, including result visualization. Odyssey is a pipeline that integrates programs such as PLINK, SHAPEIT, Eagle, IMPUTE, Minimac, and several R packages, to create a seamless, easy-to-use, and modular workflow controlled via a single user-friendly configuration file. Odyssey was built with compatibility in mind, and thus utilizes the Singularity container solution, which can be run on Linux, MacOS, and Windows platforms. It is also easily scalable from a simple desktop to a High-Performance System (HPS). Conclusion Odyssey facilitates efficient and fast genome-wide association analysis automation and can go from raw genetic data to genome: phenome association visualization and analyses results in 3‚Äì8‚Äâh on average, depending on the input data, choice of programs within the pipeline and available computer resources. Odyssey was built to be flexible, portable, compatible, scalable, and easy to setup. Biologists less familiar with programing can now work hands on with their own big data using this easy-to-use pipeline.

0.268547551,16101750,Graded classes of cortical connections: quantitative analyses of laminar projections to motion areas of cat extrastriate cortex," Current hierarchical models of the cerebral cortex are mainly based on qualitative connection studies. From wheatgerm-agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase injections, we examined the laminar patterns of projections to and between the three major subdivisions of the motion-processing lateral suprasylvian (LS) complex [areas posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area (PMLS), anteromedial lateral suprasylvian (AMLS), posterolateral lateral suprasylvian area (PLLS)] of cat extrastriate cortex and of an adjoining form-processing area, 21a. We counted ~ 145,000 labelled projection cells in 20 cortical areas in 11 cats, and applied various analyses to the data, expressed as the percent supragranular layer (%SG) origin of each connection. We report two main results. (i) A wide range of %SG values was obtained, both from each individual cat and across the 163 projections examined. Nonetheless, both hierarchical and non-parametric cluster analyses of the pooled connection origins suggested the presence of three distinct laminar projection classes, constrained by graded %SG values of 0‚Äì33%, 39‚Äì69% and 76‚Äì97%. These conformed, respectively, to feedback, lateral and feedforward laminar patterns seen qualitatively in our material. (ii) Hierarchical connectivity analyses suggested that PMLS, AMLS and PLLS are ordered in a hierarchical sequence. Macaque motion areas V5/MT, MST and FST are arranged in a similar sequence, and areas at equivalent levels of the two motion hierarchies have some analogous functional specializations. Our findings provide the first objective support for the three laminar projection classes that underpin existing theoretical models of hierarchical cortical organization, and they suggest that the implementation of higher-order motion processing evolved along similar lines in the cat and monkey visual cortex.

0.093552985,24560525,Revealing the role of the autonomic nervous system in the development and maintenance of Goldblatt hypertension in rats,"Despite extensive use of the renovascular/Goldblatt model of hypertension‚Äî2K-1C, and the use of renal denervation to treat drug resistant hypertensive patients, autonomic mechanisms that underpin the maintenance of this hypertension are important yet remain unclear. Our aim was to analyse cardiovascular autonomic function by power spectral density analysis of both arterial pressure and pulse interval measured continuously by radio telemetry for 6¬†weeks after renal artery clipping. Mean arterial pressure increased from 106¬†¬±¬†5 to 185¬†¬±¬†2¬†mm¬†Hg during 5¬†weeks post clipping when it stabilized. A tachycardia developed during the 4th week, which plateaued between weeks 5 and 6. The gain of the cardiac vagal baroreflex decreased immediately after clipping and continued to do so until the 5th week when it plateaued (from ‚àí¬†2.4¬†¬±¬†0.09 to ‚àí¬†0.8¬†¬±¬†0.04¬†bpm/mm¬†Hg; P¬†<¬†0.05). A similar time course of changes in the high frequency power spectral density of the pulse interval was observed (decrease from 13.4¬†¬±¬†0.6 to 8.3¬†¬±¬†0.01¬†ms 2 ; P¬†<¬†0.05). There was an increase in both the very low frequency and low frequency components of systolic blood pressure that occurred 3 and 4¬†weeks after clipping, respectively. Thus, we show for the first time the temporal profile of autonomic mechanisms underpinning the initiation, development and maintenance of renovascular hypertension including: an immediate depression of cardiac baroreflex gain followed by a delayed cardiac sympathetic predominance; elevated sympathetic vasomotor drive occurring after the initiation of the hypertension but coinciding during its mid-development and maintenance.",Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical,NEURO
0.4437317,27335332,Do stronger school smoking policies make a difference? Analysis of the health behaviour in school-aged children survey,"Background : Associations of the strength of school smoking policies with cigarette, e-cigarette and cannabis use in Wales were examined. Methods: Nationally representative cross-sectional survey of pupils aged 11‚Äì16 years ( N =7376) in Wales. Senior management team members from 67 schools completed questionnaires about school smoking policies, substance use education and tobacco cessation initiatives. Multi-level, logistic regression analyses investigated self-reported cigarette, e-cigarette and cannabis use, for all students and those aged 15‚Äì16 years. Results: Prevalence of current smoking, e-cigarette use and cannabis use in the past month were 5.3%, 11.5% and 2.9%, respectively. Of schools that provided details about smoking policies (66/67), 39.4% were strong (written policy applied to everyone in all locations), 43.9% were moderate (written policy not applied to everyone in all locations) and 16.7% had no written policy. There was no evidence of an association of school smoking policies with pupils‚Äô tobacco or e-cigarette use. However, students from schools with a moderate policy [OR = 0.47; 95% (confidence interval) CI: 0.26‚Äì0.84] were less likely to have used cannabis in the past month compared to schools with no written policy. This trend was stronger for students aged 15‚Äì16 years (moderate policy: OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.22‚Äì0.80; strong policy: OR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.23‚Äì0.87). Conclusions: School smoking policies may exert less influence on young people‚Äôs smoking behaviours than they did during times of higher adolescent smoking prevalence.

0.986470803,12204098,Primary effect of chemotherapy on the transcription profile of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma,"Background Drugs & used in anticancer chemotherapy have severe effects upon the cellular transcription and replication machinery. From in vitro studies it has become clear that these drugs can affect specific genes, as well as have an effect upon the total transcriptome. Methods Total mRNA from two skin lesions from a single AIDS-KS patient was analyzed with the SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) technique to assess changes in the transcriptome induced by chemotherapy. SAGE libraries were constructed from material obtained 24 (KS-24) and 48 (KS-48) hrs after combination therapy with bleomycin, doxorubicin and vincristine. KS-24 and KS-48 were compared to SAGE libraries of untreated AIDS-KS, and to libraries generated from normal skin and from isolated CD4+ T-cells, using the programs USAGE and HTM. SAGE libraries were also compared with the SAGEmap database. Results In order to assess the primary response of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) to chemotherapy in vivo , we analyzed the transcriptome of AIDS-KS skin lesions from a HIV-1 seropositive patient at two time points after therapy. The mRNA profile was found to have changed dramatically within 24 hours after drug treatment. There was an almost complete absence of transcripts highly expressed in AIDS-KS, probably due to a transcription block. Analysis of KS-24 suggested that mRNA pool used in its construction originated from poly(A) binding protein (PABP) mRNP complexes, which are probably located in nuclear structures known as interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs). IGCs are known to fuse after transcription inhibition, probably affecting poly(A)+RNA distribution. Forty-eight hours after chemotherapy, mRNA isolated from the lesion was largely derived from infiltrating lymphocytes, confirming the transcriptional block in the AIDS-KS tissue. Conclusions These in vivo findings indicate that the effect of anti-cancer drugs is likely to be more global than up- or downregulation of specific genes, at least in this single patient with AIDS-KS. The SAGE results obtained 24 hrs after chemotherapy can be most plausibly explained by the isolation of a fraction of more stable poly(A)+RNA.",BMC cancer,ONCO
0.048597382,29259007,Amplification of oncolytic vaccinia virus widespread tumor cell killing by sunitinib through multiple mechanisms," Oncolytic viruses pose many questions in their use in cancer therapy. In this study, we assessed the potential of mpJX-594 (mouse-prototype JX-594), a replication-competent vaccinia virus administered by intravenous injection, to target the tumor vasculature, produce immune activation and tumor cell killing more widespread than the infection, and suppress invasion and metastasis. These actions were examined in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) that developed spontaneously and progress as in humans. mpJX-594 initially infected tumor vascular endothelial cells, leading to vascular pruning and prolonged leakage in tumors but not in normal organs; parallel effects were observed in U87 gliomas. Viral infection spread to tumor cells, where tumor cell killing was much more widespread than the infection. Widespread tumor cell killing at 5 days was prevented by depletion of CD8+ T lymphocytes and did not require GM-CSF, as mpJX-594 variants that expressed human, mouse, or no GM-CSF produced equivalent amounts of killing. The antivascular, antitumor, and antimetastatic effects of mpJX-594 were amplified by concurrent or sequential administration of sunitinib, a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). These effects were not mimicked by selective inhibition of VEGFR-2 despite equivalent vascular pruning, but were accompanied by suppression of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and greater influx of activated CD8+ T cells. Together, our results showed that mpJX-594 targets tumor blood vessels, spreads secondarily to tumor cells, and produces widespread CD8+ T-cell-dependent tumor cell killing in primary tumors and metastases, and that these effects can be amplified by co-administration of sunitinib.

Methods: This is a retrospective study of 1145 male patients who attended the Pediatric Orthopedic Clinic for a DDH check up. This study was carried out in the Orthopedic Section, Special Surgery Department, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan between March 2011 and October 2014. Data was collected from medical records, and x-ray measurements were evaluated. Results: Of the 1145 male patients, 43 (3.75%) with 70 involved hips were diagnosed with late- presenting DDH. Being a first-born baby resulted in 41.9% increased risk for DDH. Cesarian delivery was significantly associated with an increased risk of hip dislocation ( p =0.004) while normal delivery was significantly associated with acetabular dysplasia ( p =0.004). No predictable risk factors were found in 44.2% patients with DDH. Bilateral cases were more common than unilateral cases: (26 [60.5%] versus 17 [39.5%]). Limited abduction was a constant finding in all dislocated hips ( p <0.001). Associated conditions, such as club foot and congenital muscular torticollis were not observed. Conclusion: Cesarian section is a significant risk for dislocated hips while normal delivery is significantly associated with acetabular dysplasia. Bilateral DDH is more common than the unilateral.

0.737017822,23997849,Towards the Development of an Intimate Partner Violence Screening Tool for Gay and Bisexual Men,"Introduction: Recent research suggests that gay and bisexual men experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at rates comparable to heterosexual women. However, current screening tools used to identify persons experiencing IPV were largely created for use with heterosexual women. Given the high prevalence of IPV among gay and bisexual men in the United States, the lack of IPV screening tools that reflect the lived realities of gay and bisexual men is problematic.This paper describes the development of a short-form IPV screening tool intended to be used with gay and bisexual men. Methods: A novel definition of IPV, informed by formative Focus Group Discussions, was derived from a quantitative survey of approximately 1,100 venue-recruited gay and bisexual men. From this new definition, a draft IPV screening tool was created. After expert review (n=13) and cognitive interviews with gay and bisexual men (n=47), a screening tool of six questions was finalized.A national, online-recruited sample (n=822) was used to compare rates of IPV identified by the novel tool and current standard tools. Results: The six-item, short-form tool created through the six-stage research process captured a significantly higher prevalence of recent experience of IPV compared to a current and commonly used screening tool (30.7% versus 7.5%, p<0.05). The novel short-form tool described additional domains of IPV not currently found in screening tools, including monitoring behaviors, controlling behaviors, and HIV-related IPV. The screener takes less than five minutes to complete and is 6th grade reading level. Conclusion: Gay and bisexual men experiencing IPV must first be identified before services can reach them. Given emergent literature that demonstrates the high prevalence of IPV among gay and bisexual men and the known adverse health sequela of experiencing IPV, this novel screening tool may allow for the quick identification of men experiencing IPV and the opportunity for referrals for the synergistic management of IPV. Future work should focus on implementing this tool in primary or acute care settings in order to determine its acceptability and its feasibility of use more broadly.",The western journal of emergency medicine,CLINIC
0.869146578,19651192,Simple and fast classification of non-LTR retrotransposons based on phylogeny of their RT domain protein sequences," Rapidly growing number of sequenced genomes requires fast and accurate computational tools for analysis of different transposable elements (TEs). In this paper we focus on rapid and reliable procedure for classification of autonomous non-LTR retrotransposons based on alignment and clustering of their reverse transcriptase (RT) domains. Typically, the RT domain protein sequences encoded by different non-LTR retrotransposons are similar to each other in terms of significant BLASTP E-values. Therefore, they can be easily detected by the routine BLASTP searches of genomic DNA sequences coding for proteins similar to the RT domains of known non-LTR retrotransposons. However, detailed classification of non-LTR retrotransposons, i.e. their assignment to specific clades, is a slow and complex procedure that is not formalized or integrated as a standard set of computational methods and data. Here we describe a tool (RTclass1) designed for the fast and accurate automated assignment of novel non-LTR retrotransposons to known or novel clades using phylogenetic analysis of the RT domain protein sequences. RTclass1 classifies a particular non-LTR retrotransposon based on its RT domain in less than 10 minutes on a standard desktop computer and achieves 99.5% accuracy. RT1class1 works either as a standalone program installed locally or as a web-server that can be accessed distantly by uploading sequence data through the internet ( http://www.girinst.org/RTphylogeny/RTclass1 ).

Another key to progress is exchange with clinicians and pain scientists working with other model systems and approaches. These collaborative efforts require that non-imagers be able to evaluate and assess the evidence provided in these reports. Likewise, new trainees must design rigorous and reliable pain imaging experiments. In this article we provide a guideline for designing, reading, evaluating, analyzing, and reporting results of a pain neuroimaging experiment, with a focus on functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging. We focus in particular on considerations that are unique to neuroimaging studies of pain in humans, including study design and analysis, inferences that can be drawn from these studies, and the strengths and limitations of the approach.   Perspective:  This article provides an overview of the concepts and considerations of structural and functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging studies.

It facilitates embryo development and mediates implantation and is thought to have a function in endometrial receptivity and maturation. The mature HB-EGF molecule manifests its activity as either a soluble factor (sol-HB-EGF) or a transmembrane precursor (tm-HB-EGF) and can bind two receptors, EGFR and ErbB4/HER4. In this study, we identify factors that modulate expression of HB-EGF, EGFR, and ErbB4 in endometrial stromal cells in vitro . We demonstrate that levels of sol- and tm-HB-EGF, EGFR, and ErbB4 are increased by cAMP, a potent inducer of decidualization of the endometrial stroma. We also show that production of sol- and tm-HB-EGF is differentially modulated by TNFŒ± and TGFŒ≤. Our data suggest that HB-EGF has a function in endometrial maturation in mediating decidualization and attenuating TNFŒ±- and TGFŒ≤-induced apoptosis of endometrial stromal cells.

Unfortunately, no specific marker exists to differ between KSC and TA cells. Here, we aimed at comparing two different methods that pretended to isolate these two populations: (i) the rapid adhesion method on coated substrate and (ii) the flow cytometry method, which is based on the difference in cell surface expressions of the Œ±6 integrin and transferrin receptor (CD71). Then, we compared different parameters that are known to discriminate KSC and TA populations. Interestingly, we showed that both methods allow enrichment in stem cells. However, cell sorting by flow cytometry (Œ±6 high /CD71 low ) phenotype leads to a better enrichment of KSC since the colony forming efficiency is five times increased versus total cell suspension, whereas it is only 1.4 times for the adhesion method. Moreover, Œ±6 high /CD71 low cells give rise to a thicker pluristratified epithelium with lower seeding density and display a low Ki67 positive cells number, showing that they have reached the balance between proliferation and differentiation. We clearly demonstrated that cells isolated by a rapid adherent method are not the same population as KSC isolated by flow cytometry following Œ±6 high /CD71 low phenotype.",International journal of molecular sciences,BIOCHEM

The aims of this observational study were to determine the incidence of stroke and stroke risk factors among American Indians.    Methods and results  This report is based on 4549 participants aged 45‚Äì74 at enrollment in the Strong Heart Study, the largest longitudinal, population-based study of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in a diverse group of American Indians. At baseline examination in 1989‚Äì1992, 42 participants (1132/100,000, adjusted to the age and sex distribution of the U.S. adult population in 1990) had prevalent stroke. Through December 2004, 306 (6.8%) of 4507 participants without prior stroke suffered a first stroke at a mean age of 66.5 years. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence was 679/100, 000 person-years. Non-hemorrhagic cerebral infarction occurred in 86% of participants with incident strokes; 14% suffered hemorrhagic stroke. Overall age-adjusted 30-day case-fatality from first stroke was 18%, with a one-year case-fatality of 32%. Age, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, HbA1 C , smoking, albuminuria, hypertension, pre-hypertension and diabetes were risk factors of incident stroke.    Conclusions  Compared to U.S. white and black populations, American Indians have a higher incidence of stroke. The case-fatality rate for first stroke is also higher in American Indians than in the U.S. white or black population in the same age range. Our findings suggest that blood pressure and glucose control and smoking avoidance may be important avenues for stroke prevention in this population.  ",Circulation,EPIDEM

The study aimed to examine the pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous injection and oral medication of Isatin given to Beagles. Nine male and nine female Beagles were injected with 30 mg/kg of 2,3-indole quinones. The animals were divided into 3 groups (n=6 per group) and lavaged with a dose of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg, respectively. Blood samples were collected prior to the medicine delivery (0 h) and 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-medicine delivery. The blood plasma samples were analyzed using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS method following pretreatment for the protein precipitation. Pharmacokinetics software was applied to calculate relevant pharmacokinetic parameters through the atrioventricular model. The drug concentration in plasma decreased rapidly following the intravenous injection of Isatin. After 8 h, the prototype drugs could not be tested in the plasma and only trace amounts of drugs were tested in one dog, which was considered to be an endogenous drug. Indole quinone was absorbed following lavage into Beagles and peaked in <1 h, and the drug concentration in the plasma decreased rapidly. After 8 h, the prototype drugs could not be tested in the plasma. The elimination of the two drugs in the body had no evident gender differences.

When compared to sham mice, six hours after surgery, systolic wall stress (afterload) was increased in TAC (+40%, P <0.05), diastolic wall stress (preload) was increased in Shunt (+277%, P <0.05) and TAC (+74%, P <0.05) and mean total wall stress was similarly increased in TAC (69%) and Shunt (67%) (TAC vs. Shunt: not significant (n.s.), each P <0.05 vs. Sham). At 1 week, left ventricular weight/tibia length was significantly increased by 22% in TAC and 29% in Shunt (n.s. TAC vs. Shunt). After 24 hours and 1 week, calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling was increased in TAC. This resulted in altered calcium cycling, including increased L-type calcium current, calcium transients, fractional SR release and calcium spark frequency. In Shunt, Akt phosphorylation was increased. TAC was associated with inflammation, fibrosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The latter was significantly reduced in CaMKIIŒ¥-KO TAC mice. 157 mRNAs and 13 microRNAs were differentially regulated in TAC vs. Shunt. After 8 weeks, fractional shortening was lower and mortality higher in TAC    Conclusions  Afterload results in maladaptive fibrotic hypertrophy with CaMKII-dependent altered calcium cycling and apoptosis. Preload is associated with Akt activation without fibrosis, little apoptosis, better function and lower mortality. This indicates that different loads result in distinct phenotype differences which may require specific pharmacological interventions.  ",Circulation,PHYSIO
0.761502486,29971350,Serial dependence in the perception of visual variance,"The recent history of perceptual experience has been shown to influence subsequent perception. Classically, this dependence on perceptual history has been examined in sensory-adaptation paradigms, wherein prolonged exposure to a particular stimulus (e.g., a vertically oriented grating) produces changes in perception of subsequently presented stimuli (e.g., the tilt aftereffect). More recently, several studies have investigated the influence of shorter perceptual exposure with effects, referred to as serial dependence , being described for a variety of low- and high-level perceptual dimensions. In this study, we examined serial dependence in the processing of dispersion statistics, namely variance‚Äîa key descriptor of the environment and indicative of the precision and reliability of ensemble representations. We found two opposite serial dependences operating at different timescales, and likely originating at different processing levels: A positive, Bayesian-like bias was driven by the most recent exposures, dependent on feature-specific decision making and appearing only when high confidence was placed in that decision; and a longer lasting negative bias‚Äîakin to an adaptation aftereffect‚Äîbecoming manifest as the positive bias declined. Both effects were independent of spatial presentation location and the similarity of other close traits, such as mean direction of the visual variance stimulus. These findings suggest that visual variance processing occurs in high-level areas but is also subject to a combination of multilevel mechanisms balancing perceptual stability and sensitivity, as with many different perceptual dimensions.",Journal of vision,PSYCH
0.622579871,23986841,CT evaluation of spontaneously ruptured renal angiomyolipomas with massive hemorrhage spreading into multi-retroperitoneal fascia and fascial spaces,"Background Renal angiomyolipomas (RAMLs) can spontaneously rupture and induce hemorrhage that is usually confined to the perirenal space (PS) but may spread beyond the PS into other retroperitoneal fascia and fascial spaces, including up to the subdiaphramatic and down to pelvic extra-peritoneal regions. Purpose To evaluate the computed tomography (CT) manifestations of renal angiomyolipoma (RAML) associated with spontaneous rupture and massive hemorrhage spreading beyond the PS into other retroperitoneal fascia and fascial spaces, including up to the subdiaphramatic and down to pelvic extra-peritoneal regions. Material and Methods The CT scans of seven patients with spontaneously ruptured of RAMLs and massive hemorrhage (surgically and pathologically confirmed) were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated the CT signs of the RAML itself and the regions with extensive retroperitoneal spreading after RAML rupture. Results The CT manifestations of seven cases with RAML spontaneous rupture and massive hemorrhage included the following: (a) RAML signs: size (>4.0 cm, five patients; <4.0 cm, two patients), location (periphery, six patients; central portion, one patient), component (fat tissue included, seven patients), and boundary (poorly revealed, seven patients); and (b) signs of extensive retroperitoneal spreading after RAML rupture: involving the PS and extending beyond the PS (seven patients); spread to the pelvic extraperitoneal space (seven patients); attached to the subdiaphragmatic extraperitoneal region (four patients); and extended to the contralateral retroperitoneal spaces (six patients). Conclusion CT scans clearly depict both the primary tumor and complicated signs of a spontaneously ruptured RAML with massive hemorrhage, which can affect other fascial planes and retroperitoneal spaces and can extend upward to the subdiaphragmatic region and downward to the pelvic extraperitoneal region or communicate with the contralateral side.",Acta radiologica short reports,CLINIC
0.753080301,19318554,Altered Subcellular Localization of Tumor-Specific Cyclin E Isoforms Affects Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 Complex Formation and Proteasomal Regulation," In tumors, alternative translation and posttranslational proteolytic cleavage of full-length cyclin E (EL) produces tumorigenic low molecular weight cyclin E (LMW-E) isoforms that lack a portion of the EL amino-terminus containing a nuclear localization sequence. Therefore, we hypothesized that LMW-E isoforms have altered subcellular localization. To explore our hypothesis, we compared EL versus LMW-E localization in cell lysates and in vivo using fractionation and protein complementation assays. Our results reveal that LMW-E isoforms preferentially accumulate in the cytoplasm where they bind the cyclin E kinase partner, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), and have associated kinase activity. The nuclear ubiquitin ligase Fbw7 targets Cdk2-bound cyclin E for degradation; thus, we examined if altered subcellular localization affected LMW-E degradation. We found that cytoplasmic LMW-E/Cdk2 was less susceptible to Fbw7-mediated degradation. One implication of our findings is that altered LMW-E and LMW-E/Cdk2 subcellular localization may lead to aberrant LMW-E protein interactions, regulation, and activity, ultimately contributing to LMW-E tumorigenicity.

Methods: We analysed the prognostic impact of diabetes on the outcome of pancreatic cancer following resection and adjuvant chemotherapy using individual patient data from three European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer randomised controlled trials. Analyses were carried out to assess the association between clinical characteristics and the presence of preoperative diabetes, as well as the effect of diabetic status on overall survival. Results: In total, 1105 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 257 (23%) had confirmed diabetes and 848 (77%) did not. Median (95% confidence interval (CI)) unadjusted overall survival in non-diabetic patients was 22.3 (20.8‚Äì24.1) months compared with 18.8 (16.9‚Äì22.1) months for diabetic patients ( P =0.24). Diabetic patients were older, had increased weight and more co-morbidities. Following adjustment, multivariable analysis demonstrated that diabetic patients had an increased risk of death (hazard ratio: 1.19 (95% CI 1.01, 1.40), P =0.034). Maximum tumour size of diabetic patients was larger at randomisation (33.6 vs 29.7‚Äâmm, P =0.026).

0.7375402,26482349,The Early Functional Abilities (EFA) scale to assess neurological and neurosurgical early rehabilitation patients,"Background It is difficult to assess neurological and neurosurgical early rehabilitation patients comprehensively. Available scales focus on activities of daily living (Barthel (BI) and Early Rehabilitation Barthel Index (ERBI)) or wakefulness (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Coma Remission Scale (CRS)) while cognitive items are missing. Methods The Early Functional Abilities (EFA) scale comprises 20 items referring to activities of daily living (ADL), wakefulness and cognitive abilities. To evaluate its validity, n =‚Äâ623 early neurological and neurosurgical rehabilitation patients (most of them after ischemic stroke or cerebral bleeding) were assessed on admission using the EFA, ERBI, GCS, CRS and measures of morbidity (co-diagnoses). Results The more co-diagnoses the lower EFA sum scores were obtained (Spearman-Rho r s =‚Äâ-0.509, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). EFA predicted length of stay (LOS, r s =‚Äâ-0.565, p <‚Äâ0.001) and BI at discharge (r s =‚Äâ0.571, p <‚Äâ0.001).

However, very little is known about RGS14 protein expression in the primate brain. Here, we validate the specificity of a new polyclonal RGS14 antibody that recognizes not only full length RGS14 protein in primate, but also lower molecular weight forms of RGS14 protein matching previously predicted human splice variants. These putative RGS14 variants along with full-length RGS14 are expressed in the primate striatum. By contrast, only full length RGS14 is expressed in hippocampus, and shorter variants are completely absent in rodent brain. We report that RGS14 protein immunoreactivity is found both pre- and postsynaptically in multiple neuron populations throughout hippocampal area CA1 and CA2, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and amygdala in adult rhesus monkeys. A similar cellular expression pattern of RGS14 in the monkey striatum and hippocampus was further confirmed in humans. Our electron microscopy data show for the first time that RGS14 immunostaining localizes within nuclei of striatal neurons in monkeys. Taken together, these findings suggest new pre- and postsynaptic regulatory functions of RGS14 and RGS14 variants, specific to the primate brain, and provide evidence for unconventional roles of RGS14 in the nuclei of striatal neurons potentially important for human neurophysiology and disease.

0.589610662,26191534,Incidence and Costs of  Clostridium difficile  Infections in Canada,"CDI has a substantial epidemiologic, and economic, burden; and the largest proportion of costs arise from prolonged hospitalization. Interventions reducing the severity of infection and/or relapses requiring rehospitalization are likely to have the largest absolute effect on direct medical cost. Background. Limited data are available on direct medical costs and lost productivity due to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in Canada. Methods. We developed an economic model to estimate the costs of managing hospitalized and community-dwelling patients with CDI in Canada. The number of episodes was projected based on publicly available national rates of hospital-associated CDI and the estimate that 64% of all CDI is hospital-associated. Clostridium difficile infection recurrences were classified as relapses or reinfections. Resource utilization data came from published literature, clinician interviews, and Canadian CDI surveillance programs, and this included the following: hospital length of stay, contact with healthcare providers, pharmacotherapy, laboratory testing, and in-hospital procedures. Lost productivity was considered for those under 65 years of age, and the economic impact was quantified using publicly available labor statistics. Unit costs were obtained from published sources and presented in 2012 Canadian dollars. Results. There were an estimated 37 900 CDI episodes in Canada in 2012; 7980 (21%) of these were relapses, out of a total of 10 900 (27%) episodes of recurrence. The total cost to society of CDI was estimated at $281 million; 92% ($260 million) was in-hospital costs, 4% ($12 million) was direct medical costs in the community, and 4% ($10 million) was due to lost productivity. Management of CDI relapses alone accounted for $65.1 million (23%). Conclusions. The largest proportion of costs due to CDI in Canada arise from extra days of hospitalization.

0.560378007,24790910,Comparison of Total and IgG ABO Antibody Titers in Healthy Individuals by Using Tube and Column Agglutination Techniques,"Background Most immune reactions related to transfusion and transplantation are caused by IgM ABO antibodies. However, IgG also plays an important role in these reactions. Therefore, a method to measure antibodies, including IgG, is necessary. We investigated ABO antibody titers of healthy individuals using a column agglutination technique (CAT) with or without dithiothreitol (DTT) and compared them with titers obtained using a conventional tube method. Methods Among healthy adults who underwent a medical examination, 180 individuals (60 with blood group A, 60 with group B, and 60 with group O) were selected. Antibody titrations were performed using the immediate spin (IS) tube, anti-human globulin (AHG) tube, and CAT with or without DTT methods. Results Higher median values of anti-B and anti-A titers in groups A and B individuals, respectively, were obtained using the IS method than using the AHG method. Higher values for group O individuals were obtained using the AHG method. Higher median titers of anti-B and anti-A in group O individuals were obtained using CAT without DTT than using the AHG method. Median titers of anti-B and anti-A in all blood groups were higher in CAT without DTT than in CAT with DTT, especially for group O individuals. Conclusions We recommend CAT with and without DTT for titration of anti-A and anti-B, especially in group O individuals, to provide more sensitive results that include IgG data.

0.798684667,21151374,Functional Anatomy: Dynamic States in Basal Ganglia Circuits,"The most appealing models of how the basal ganglia function propose distributed patterns of cortical activity selectively interacting with striatal networks to yield the execution of context-dependent movements. If movement is encoded by patterns of activity then these may be disrupted by influences at once more subtle and more devastating than the increase or decrease of neuronal firing that dominate the usual models of the circuit. In the absence of dopamine the compositional capabilities of cell assemblies in the network could be disrupted by the generation of dominant synchronous activity that engages most of the system. Experimental evidence about Parkinson's disease suggests that dopamine loss produces abnormal patterns of activity in different nuclei. For example, increased oscillatory activity arises in the GPe, GPi, and STN and is reflected as increased cortical beta frequency coherence disrupting the ability to produce motor sequences. When the idea of deep brain stimulation was proposed ‚Äì it was supported by the information that lesions of the subthalamus reversed the effects of damage to the dopamine input to the system. However, it seems increasingly unlikely that the stimulation acts by silencing the nucleus as was at first proposed. Perhaps the increased cortical beta activity caused by the lack of dopamine could have disabled the patterning of network activity. Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus disrupts the on-going cortical rhythms. Subsequently asynchronous firing is reinstated and striatal cell assemblies and the whole basal ganglia circuit engage in a more normal pattern of activity. We will review the different variables involved in the generation of sequential activity patterns, integrate our data on deep brain stimulation and network population dynamics, and thus provide a novel interpretation of functional aspects of basal ganglia circuitry.",Frontiers in neuroanatomy,NEURO

Virions were spherical, 78 nm in mean diameter, and composed of a helical nucleocapsid within an envelope with surface projections. Herein, we show that infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus resulted in distinct ultrastructural features: double-membrane vesicles, nucleocapsid inclusions, and large granular areas of cytoplasm. These three structures and the coronavirus particles were shown to be positive for viral proteins and RNA by using ultrastructural immunogold and in situ hybridization assays. In addition, ultrastructural examination of a bronchiolar lavage specimen from a SARS patient showed numerous coronavirus-infected cells with features similar to those in infected culture cells.

0.747292762,30349366,Application of fluorescein sodium in breast cancer brain-metastasis surgery,"Objective Surgical resection serves an important role in the multidisciplinary treatment of cerebral metastases (CMs). Conventional white-light, microsurgical, and circumferential stripping of CMs is standard neurosurgical procedure, but is associated with a high recurrence rate. Based on this outcome, there is an urgent need for a new surgical strategy, such as fluorescence-guided resection, for CMs, in order to achieve total removal. Methods A retrospective study was carried out in 38 patients clinically and pathologically diagnosed with breast cancer brain metastasis at three medical centers from May 2012 to June 2016. The study comprised group 1 (fluorescein-guided surgery) and group 2 (standard microsurgery). In group 1, 5 mg/kg of fluorescein sodium was injected intravenously after an allergy test and before general anesthesia for 17 patients. A yellow 560 filter was employed for microsurgical tumor resection. Group 2 consisted of 21 patients for whom fluorescein was not administered. Results Surgical outcomes were assessed concerning the extent of resection and Karnofsky performance status. Gross total resection was achieved in these patients, with high fluorescence markedly enhancing tumor visibility. The extent of resection had a powerful influence on performance status. Overall survival after CM was 24.1 months in patients given fluorescein and was 22.8 months in the nonfluorescein group. Conclusion Fluorescein-guided surgery is a simple, safe, and practical method to resect breast cancer brain metastasis, and leads to a higher proportion of resection compared to common microsurgery. This offers a tremendous advantage when navigating a tiny tumor, and improves the quality of life of patients with CM.",Cancer management and research,ONCO

We investigated whether TWH is elevated during exercise tolerance testing (ETT) in symptomatic diabetic patients with nonflow- limiting coronary artery stenosis compared to control subjects without diabetes.    Methods:  Cases were all patients ( n = 20) with analyzable ECG recordings during both rest and ETT who were enrolled in the Effects of Ranolazine on Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) in Symptomatic Patients with Diabetes and Suspected or Known Coronary Artery Disease (RAND- CFR) study (NCT01754259); median CFR was 1.44; 80% of cases had CFR <2. Control subjects ( n = 9) were nondiabetic patients who had functional flow reserve (FFR) >0.8, a range not associated with inducible ischemia. TWH was analyzed from precordial leads V 4 , V 5 , and V 6 by second central moment analysis, which assesses the interlead splay of T- waves about a mean waveform.    Results:  During exercise to similar rate-pressure products ( p = .31), RAND- CFR patients exhibited a 49% increase in TWH during exercise (rest: 49 ¬± 5 ŒºV; exercise: 73 ¬± 8 ŒºV, p = .003). By comparison, in control subjects, TWH was not significantly altered (rest: 52 ¬± 11 ŒºV; ETT: 38 ¬± 5 ŒºV, p = .19). ETT- induced ST- segment depression >1 mm ( p = .11) and T peak - T end ( p = .18) and QTc intervals ( p = .80) failed to differentiate cases from controls.    Conclusions:  TWH is capable of detecting latent repolarization abnormalities, which are present during ETT in diabetic patients with nonflow-limiting stenosis but not in control subjects. The technique developed in this study permits TWH analysis from archived ECGs and thereby enables mining of extensive databases for retrospective studies and hypothesis testing.

Pre-treatment with ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles (USMB) has enabled higher-dose radiation effects with conventional radiation doses. This study aimed to confirm acute and longitudinal relationships between vascular shutdown and tumour cell death following radiation and USMB in a wild type murine fibrosarcoma model using in vivo imaging. Methods: Tumour xenografts were treated with single radiation doses of 2 or 8 Gy alone, or in combination with low-/high-concentration USMB. Vascular changes and tumour cell death were evaluated at 3, 24 and 72 h following therapy, using high-frequency 3D power Doppler and quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy (QUS) methods, respectively. Staining using in situ end labelling (ISEL) and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) of tumour sections were used to assess cell death and vascular distributions, respectively, as gold standard histological methods. Results: Results indicated a decrease in the power Doppler signal of up to 50%, and an increase of more than 5 dBr in cell-death linked QUS parameters at 24 h for tumours treated with combined USMB and radiotherapy. Power Doppler and quantitative ultrasound results were significantly correlated with CD31 and ISEL staining results (p < 0.05), respectively. Moreover, a relationship was found between ultrasound power Doppler and QUS results, as well as between micro-vascular densities (CD31) and the percentage of cell death (ISEL) (R 2 0.5-0.9). Conclusions: This study demonstrated, for the first time, the link between acute vascular shutdown and acute tumour cell death using in vivo longitudinal imaging, contributing to the development of theoretical models that incorporate vascular effects in radiation therapy. Overall, this study paves the way for theranostic use of ultrasound in radiation oncology as a diagnostic modality to characterize vascular and tumour response effects simultaneously, as well as a therapeutic modality to complement radiation therapy.",Theranostics,ONCO

We searched for the possible amplification of other genes in gastric cancer. Methods and Results A genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis was performed using three cell lines of differentiated gastric cancers, and 22 genes (including ERBB2 ) in five highly amplified chromosome regions (with a copy number of more than 6) were identified. Particular attention was paid to the CRKL gene, the product of which is an adaptor protein containing Src homology 2 and 3 (SH2/SH3) domains. An extremely high CRKL copy number was confirmed in the MKN74 gastric cancer cell line using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and a high level of CRKL expression was also observed in the cells. The RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of CRKL in MKN74 disclosed the ability of CRKL to upregulate gastric cell proliferation. An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CRKL protein was overexpressed in 24.4% (88/360) of the primary gastric cancers that were analyzed. The CRKL copy number was also examined in 360 primary gastric cancers using a FISH analysis, and CRKL amplification was found to be associated with CRKL overexpression. Finally, we showed that MKN74 cells with CRKL amplification were responsive to the dual Src/BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor BMS354825, likely via the inhibition of CRKL phosphorylation, and that the proliferation of MKN74 cells was suppressed by treatment with a CRKL-targeting peptide. Conclusion These results suggested that CRKL protein is overexpressed in a subset of gastric cancers and is associated with CRKL amplification in gastric cancer. Furthermore, our results suggested that CRKL protein has the ability to regulate gastric cell proliferation and has the potential to serve as a molecular therapy target for gastric cancer.",Journal of translational medicine,ONCO

Like CCCA, fibroproliferative disorders (FPDs) such as keloids, atherosclerosis, and fibroids are characterized by low-grade inflammation and irritation, resulting in end-stage fibrosis.    Objective:  We sought to determine whether fibroproliferative genes were up-regulated in patients with CCCA.    Methods:  A total of 5 patients with biopsy-proven CCCA were recruited for this study. Two scalp biopsy specimens were obtained from each patient; 1 from CCCA-affected vertex scalp and 1 from the unaffected occipital scalp. Microarray analysis was performed to determine the differential gene expression patterns.    Results:  There was an upregulation of genes implicated in FPDs in patients with CCCA. Specifically, we noted increased expression of platelet derived growth factor gene ( PDGF ), collagen I gene ( COL I ), collagen III gene ( COL III ), matrix metallopeptidase 1 gene ( MMP1 ), matrix metallopeptidase 2 gene ( MMP2 ), matrix metallopeptidase 7 gene ( MMP7 ), and matrix metallopeptidase 9 gene ( MMP9 ) in affected scalp compared with in unaffected scalp. Significant overlap in the canonic pathways was noted between patients with CCCA and patients with both atherosclerosis and hepatic fibrosis ( P <.001).

In the first experiment, the vibration transmissibility on the system was measured as a continuous function of grip force while the hand was subjected to discrete sinusoidal excitations. In the second experiment, the biodynamic responses of the system subjected to a broadband random vibration were measured under five levels of grip forces and a combination of grip and push forces. This study found that the transmissibility at each given frequency increased with the increase in the grip force before reaching a maximum level. The transmissibility then tended to plateau or decrease when the grip force was further increased. This threshold force increased with an increase in the vibration frequency. These relationships remained the same for both types of vibrations. The implications of the experimental results are discussed.   Practitioner Summary:  Shocks and vibrations transmitted to the hand‚Äìarm system may cause injuries and disorders of the system. How to take hand coupling force into account in the risk assessment of vibration exposure remains an important issue for further studies.

Distinct water masses were identified based on their physical and chemical characteristics. The bacterial and archaeal communities were depth-stratified with a total of 116 and 25 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively, distributed among the distinct water masses as revealed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, and cloning and sequencing. The relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota , determined by catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization, was significantly higher in deeper layers (Antarctic Bottom Water, AABW, >‚ÄÉ4000‚ÄÉm depth), contributing up to 31% to the total prokaryotic community, than in the mesopelagic and lower euphotic layer. Although the contribution of SAR11 to bacterial abundance did not increase with depth, SAR202, SAR324, SAR406 and Alteromonas did increase with depth. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed successional changes in the bacterial and archaeal community composition of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) with a passage time through the RFZ of c . 4‚ÄÉmonths but not in the under- and overlying water masses. Our results indicate that specific water masses harbor distinct bacterial and archaeal communities and that the prokaryotic community of the NADW undergoes successional changes in this conduit between the western and eastern Atlantic basin.

Namely, these include timely and accurate diagnosis; disease stratification; risk prediction; tracking disease progression; and decision making for intervention optimisation and maximising therapeutic response (such as medication selection, disease staging, and targeted support). Using some recent examples of research across a range of relevant neurological conditions‚Äîincluding Parkinson‚Äôs disease, ataxia, and dementia‚Äîwe will illustrate evidence that supports progress against these unmet clinical needs. We summarise the novel ‚Äòbig data‚Äô approaches that utilise data mining and machine learning techniques to improve disease classification and risk prediction, and conclude with recommendations for future direction.",Brain sciences,NEURO
0.888426476,24753413,High-efficiency genome editing via 2A-coupled co-expression of fluorescent proteins and zinc finger nucleases or CRISPR/Cas9 nickase pairs,"Targeted endonucleases including zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)/Cas9 are increasingly being used for genome editing in higher species. We therefore devised a broadly applicable and versatile method for increasing editing efficiencies by these tools. Briefly, 2A peptide-coupled co-expression of fluorescent protein and nuclease was combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to allow for efficient isolation of cell populations with increasingly higher nuclease expression levels, which translated into increasingly higher genome editing rates. For ZFNs, this approach, combined with delivery of donors as single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides and nucleases as messenger ribonucleic acid, enabled high knockin efficiencies in demanding applications, including biallelic codon conversion frequencies reaching 30‚Äì70% at high transfection efficiencies and ‚àº2% at low transfection efficiencies, simultaneous homozygous knockin mutation of two genes with ‚àº1.5% efficiency as well as generation of cell pools with almost complete codon conversion via three consecutive targeting and FACS events. Observed off-target effects were minimal, and when occurring, our data suggest that they may be counteracted by selecting intermediate nuclease levels where off-target mutagenesis is low, but on-target mutagenesis remains relatively high. The method was also applicable to the CRISPR/Cas9 system, including CRISPR/Cas9 mutant nickase pairs, which exhibit low off-target mutagenesis compared to wild-type Cas9.",Nucleic acids research,BIOCHEM
0.354577871,29628373,Hippocampal neural circuits respond to optogenetic pacing of theta frequencies by generating accelerated oscillation frequencies," SUMMARY  Biological oscillations can be controlled by a small population of rhythmic pacemaker cells, or in the brain, also emerge from complex cellular and circuit-level interactions. Whether and how these mechanisms are combined to give rise to oscillatory patterns that govern cognitive function is not well understood. For example, the activity of hippocampal networks is temporally coordinated by a 7‚Äì9 Hz local field potential (LFP) theta rhythm, yet many individual cells decouple from the LFP frequency to oscillate at frequencies ~1 Hz higher. To better understand the network interactions that produce these complex oscillatory patterns, we asked whether the relative frequency difference between LFP and individual cells is retained when the LFP frequency is perturbed experimentally. We found that rhythmic optogenetic stimulation of medial septal GABAergic neurons controlled the hippocampal LFP frequency outside of the endogenous theta range, even during behavioral states when endogenous mechanisms would otherwise have generated 7‚Äì9 Hz theta oscillations. While the LFP frequency matched the optogenetically induced stimulation frequency, the oscillation frequency of individual hippocampal cells remained broadly distributed, and in a subset of cells, including interneurons, was accelerated beyond the new base LFP frequency. The inputs from septal GABAergic neurons to the hippocampus therefore do not appear to directly control the cellular oscillation frequency but rather engage cellular and circuit mechanisms that accelerate the rhythmicity of individual cells. Theta oscillations are therefore an example of cortical oscillations that combine inputs from a subcortical pacemaker with local computations to generate complex oscillatory patterns that support cognitive functions.

0.333504801,27280939,Sex Differences in Mortality Following Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury among Older Adults,"  Background  Older adults have the highest rates of hospitalization and mortality from traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet outcomes in this population are not well studied. In particular, contradictory reports on the protective effect of female sex on mortality following TBI may have been related to age differences in TBI and other injury severity and mechanism. The objective of this study was to determine if there are sex differences in mortality following isolated TBI among older adults and compare to findings using all TBI. A secondary objective was to characterize TBI severity and mechanism by sex in this population.    Methods  This was a retrospective cohort study conducted among adults aged 65 and older treated for TBI at a single large level I trauma center 1996‚Äì2012 (n=4,854). Individuals treated for TBI were identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD-9-CM) codes. Isolated TBI was defined as an Abbreviated Injury Scale score = 0 for other body regions. Our primary outcome was mortality at discharge.    Results  Among those with isolated TBI (n=1,320), women (45% of sample) were older (78.9 (standard deviation 7.7) years) than men (76.8 (7.5) years)(p<0.001). Women were more likely to have been injured in a fall (91% vs. 84%, p<0.001). Adjusting for multiple injury severity measures, female sex was not significantly associated with decreased odds of mortality following isolated TBI (OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.66, 1.54). Using all TBI cases, adjusted analysis found that female sex was significantly associated with decreased odd of mortality (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.59, 0.89).    Conclusions  We found no sex differences in mortality following isolated TBI among older adults, in contrast with other studies and our own analyses using all TBI cases. Researchers should consider isolated TBI in outcome studies to prevent residual confounding by severity of other injuries.    Level of Evidence  Epidemiologic study, level III.

0.15250134,29666301,Fratricide of NK Cells in Daratumumab Therapy for Multiple Myeloma Overcome by  Ex Vivo  Expanded Autologous NK Cells,"  Purpose  Daratumumab and its use in combination with other agents is becoming a new standard of care for treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). We mechanistically studied how daratumumab acts on NK cells.    Experimental design  Quantities of NK cells in peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) of MM patients or healthy donors were examined by flow cytometry. NK cell apoptosis and the associated mechanism were assessed by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. Patients' NK cells were expanded in vitro using feeder cells. Combination treatment of daratumumab and expanded NK cells was performed using an MM.1S xenograft animal model.    Results  CD38 ‚àí/low NK cells survived, while CD38 + NK cells were almost completely eliminated, in PB and BM of daratumumab-treated MM patients. NK cell depletion occurred due to daratumumab-induced NK cell fratricide via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Consequently, CD38 ‚àí/low NK cells were more effective for eradicating MM cells than were CD38 + NK cells in the presence of daratumumab. Blockade of CD38 with the F(ab) 2 fragments of daratumumab inhibited the antibody-mediated NK cell fratricide. CD38 ‚àí/low NK cells displayed a significantly better potential for expansion than CD38 + NK cells, and the expanded NK cells derived from the former population were more cytotoxic than those derived from the latter against MM cells. Therefore, infusion of ex vivo -expanded autologous NK cells from daratumumab-treated patients may improve the antibody therapy.    Conclusion  We unravel a fratricide mechanism for daratumumab-mediated NK cell depletion and provide a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome this side effect in daratumumab-treated MM patients.

0.872604245,30092059,Patients with cystic echinococcosis in the three national referral centers of Mongolia: A model for CE management assessment,"Background Mongolia is one of the endemic countries for cystic echinococcosis (CE), a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus . The goal of this study is to describe the current clinical management of CE in Mongolia, to capture the distribution of cyst stages of patients treated, and to contrast current practice with WHO-IWGE expert consensus. Methods Hospital records of CE patients treated between 2008 and 2015 at the three state hospitals and fulfilling the inclusion criterion ‚Äòdischarge diagnosis CE‚Äô (ICD 10 code B.67.0‚Äì67.9) were reviewed. Demographical, geographical, clinical and ultrasonography (US) data were extracted and analyzed. The annual surgical incidence was estimated. The digital copies of US cyst images were independently staged by three international experts following the WHO CE cyst classification to determine the proportions of patients which ideally would have been assigned to the WHO recommended treatment modalities surgery, percutaneous, medical (benzimidazole) treatment and watch & wait. Results A total of 290 patient records fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study. 45.7% of patients were below 15 years of age. 73.7% of CE cysts were located in abdominal organs, predominantly liver. US images of 84 patients were staged and assessed for interrater-agreement. The average raw agreement was 77.2%. Unweighted Kappa coefficient and weighted Kappa was 0.57 and 0.59, respectively. Mean proportions of images judged as stages CE1, CE2, CE3a, CE3b, CE4 and CL were 0.59, 0.01, 0.19, 0.08, 0.03 and 0.11, respectively. 40 cysts met the inclusion criteria of treatment modality analysis. The mean proportions of cases with a single cyst assigned to medical, percutaneous treatment, surgery and watch & wait were 52.5% (95% CI 42‚Äì65), 25.8% (95% CI 15‚Äì30), 5.1% (95% CI 0‚Äì10) and 3.3% (95% CI 0‚Äì10), respectively. 13.3% (95% CI 5‚Äì25) of cysts were staged as CL and therefore assigned to further diagnostic requirement. Conclusion WHO CE cyst classification and WHO-IWGE expert consensus on clinical CE management is not implemented in Mongolia. This results in exclusively surgical treatment, an unnecessary high risk approach for the majority of patients who could receive medical, percutaneous treatment or observation (watch & wait). Introduction of WHO-IWGE expert consensus and training in ultrasound CE cyst staging would be highly beneficial for patients and the health care services. Author summary Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic disease, commonly known as dog tapeworm. The disease is distributed globally and predominantly affects rural populations with limited access to health care. Following the expert consensus of the WHO-Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis (WHO‚ÄîIWGE) patients with uncomplicated cysts are assigned on the basis of WHO cyst classification to four treatment modalities: medical (benzimidazoles), percutaneous, surgical treatment, and ‚Äòwatch & wait‚Äô. In Mongolia, one third of the population practices nomadic farming. These populations are heavily affected by CE. However, cyst staging and WHO-IWGE recommendations are not implemented and patients referred to the three national treatment centres receive surgical treatment. This exposes a large proportion of patients to an unnecessary high risk approach who could be treated‚Äìdepending on cyst stage‚Äîwith benzimidazoles, percutaneously or observed (watch & wait). We reviewed the hospital records of patients with CE and admitted between 2008 and 2015 to the three national CE treatment centres, retrospectively staged the cysts and assigned the patients to the four WHO-IWGE recommended treatment modalities. We found a high proportion of patients in the study population who would have most likely benefitted from non-surgical treatment options.",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,IMMUN
0.587522283,20837772,Fra-2/AP-1 controls bone formation by regulating osteoblast differentiation and collagen production,"Both the osteoblast-specific osteocalcin gene and collagen 1Œ±2 are targets of the transcription factor Fra-2, which controls bone formation. The activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, in particular the Fos proteins, is an important regulator of bone homeostasis. Fra-2 ( Fosl2 ), a Fos-related protein of the AP-1 family, is expressed in bone cells, and newborn mice lacking Fra-2 exhibit defects in chondrocytes and osteoclasts. Here we show that Fra-2‚Äìdeficient osteoblasts display a differentiation defect both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, Fra-2‚Äìoverexpressing mice are osteosclerotic because of increased differentiation of osteoblasts, which appears to be cell autonomous. Importantly, the osteoblast-specific osteocalcin ( Oc ) gene and collagen1Œ±2 ( col1Œ±2 ) are transcriptional targets of Fra-2 in both murine and human bone cells. In addition, Fra-2, Oc, and col1 are expressed in stromal cells of human chondroblastic and osteoblastic osteosarcomas (Os‚Äôs) as well as during osteoblast differentiation of human Os cell lines. These findings reveal a novel function of Fra-2/AP-1 as a positive regulator of bone and matrix formation in mice and humans.",The Journal of cell biology,BIOCHEM
0.809127719,27752289,Mechanical properties of the tumor stromal microenvironment probed  in vitro  and  ex vivo  by  in situ -calibrated optical trap-based active microrheology," One of the hallmarks of the malignant transformation of epithelial tissue is the modulation of stromal components of the microenvironment. In particular, aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and stiffening enhances tumor growth and survival and promotes metastasis. Type I collagen is one of the major ECM components. It serves as a scaffold protein in the stroma contributing to the tissue‚Äôs mechanical properties, imparting tensile strength and rigidity to tissues such as those of the skin, tendons, and lungs. Here we investigate the effects of intrinsic spatial heterogeneities due to fibrillar architecture, pore size and ligand density on the microscale and bulk mechanical properties of the ECM. Type I collagen hydrogels with topologies tuned by polymerization temperature and concentration to mimic physico-chemical properties of a normal tissue and tumor microenvironment were measured by in situ -calibrated A ctive M icrorheology by O ptical T rapping revealing significantly different microscale complex shear moduli at Hz-kHz frequencies and two orders of magnitude of strain amplitude that we compared to data from bulk rheology measurements. Access to higher frequencies enabled observation of transitions from elastic to viscous behavior that occur at ~200Hz to 2750Hz, which largely was dependent on tissue architecture well outside the dynamic range of instrument acquisition possible with SAOS bulk rheology. We determined that mouse melanoma tumors and human breast tumors displayed complex moduli ~5‚Äì1000 Pa, increasing with frequency and displaying a nonlinear stress-strain response. Thus, we show the feasibility of a mechanical biopsy in efforts to provide a diagnostic tool to aid in the design of therapeutics complementary to those based on standard histopathology.

0.441480671,27453688,Surfactant toxicity to  Artemia Franciscana  and the influence of humic acid and chemical composition," Surfactants can be extremely toxic to aquatic species and are introduced to the environment in a variety of ways. It is thus important to understand how other environmental constituents, in this case humic acids (HAs), may alter the toxicity of anthropogenic surfactants. Hatching and mortality assays of Artemia Franciscana were performed for three different toxic surfactants: Triton X-100 (Tx-100, non-ionic), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC, cationic), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, anionic). Humic acids of varying composition and concentrations were added to the assays to determine the toxicity mitigating ability of the HAs. Tx-100 had a significant toxic effect on Artemia mortality rates and HAs from terrestrial sources were able to mitigate the toxicity, but an aquatic HA did not. CPC and SDS limited hatching success of the Artemia and, as HAs were added, the hatching percentages increased for all HA sources, indicating toxicity mitigation. In order to determine which functional groups within HAs were responsible for the interaction with the surfactants, the HAs were chemically modified by: (i) bleaching to reduce aromatics, (ii) Soxhlet extraction to reduce lipids, and (iii) acid hydrolysis to reduce O- and N-alkyl groups. Although most of the modified HAs had some toxicity mitigating ability for each of the surfactants, there were two notable differences: 1) the lipid-extracted HA did not reduce the toxicity of Tx-100 and 2) the bleached HA had a lower toxicity mitigating ability for CPC than the other modified HAs.

0.607354886,31004386,Impact of sampling rate on statistical significance for single subject fMRI connectivity analysis,"Abstract A typical time series in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) exhibits autocorrelation, that is, the samples of the time series are dependent. In addition, temporal filtering, one of the crucial steps in preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance images, induces its own autocorrelation. While performing connectivity analysis in fMRI, the impact of the autocorrelation is largely ignored. Recently, autocorrelation has been addressed by variance correction approaches, which are sensitive to the sampling rate. In this article, we aim to investigate the impact of the sampling rate on the variance correction approaches. Toward this end, we first derived a generalized expression for the variance of the sample Pearson correlation coefficient (SPCC) in terms of the sampling rate and the filter cutoff frequency, in addition to the autocorrelation and cross‚Äêcovariance functions of the time series. Through simulations, we illustrated the importance of the variance correction for a fixed sampling rate. Using the real resting state fMRI data sets, we demonstrated that the data sets with higher sampling rates were more prone to false positives, in agreement with the existing empirical reports. We further demonstrated with single subject results that for the data sets with higher sampling rates, the variance correction strategy restored the integrity of true connectivity.",Human brain mapping,NEURO

Materials and Methods Fifty-three consecutive, fresh IVF/ICSI cycles performed from 2014 to 2017 were selected. All women were normal responders (4 to 14 mature oocytes were retrieved) and at least one normally fertilized oocyte with two pronuclei was obtained in all cycles. Semen was collected on the day of oocyte retrieval, and SDF levels were measured by sperm chromatin dispersion test (Halosperm assay). At day 3 after insemination, embryo quality was evaluated by morphologic criteria and categorized as A/B/C/D. Top quality embryo were defined as grade A embryos with seven cells or more. Results SDF levels showed a positive linear correlation with the male's age (r=0.307, p =0.025) and a negative linear correlation with sperm motility (r=‚àí0.491, p <0.0001). To achieve top-quality or a grade A embryo formation rate >70%, the cut-off value SDF was <30.7% for each. Among individuals with SDF <30.7%, the median top-quality or grade A embryo formation rate was significantly higher than that among individuals with SDF ‚â•30.7% (38.1% vs. 20.0%, p =0.038; 50% vs. 25.0%, p =0.017). Conclusion In normal responder women, high SDF level resulted in low day 3 embryo formation rates.

0.011692771,28822857,Exploring Associations of Clinical and Social Parameters with Violent Behaviors among Psychiatric Patients," Evidence has revealed interesting associations of clinical and social parameters with violent behaviors of patients with psychiatric disorders. Men are more violent preceding and during hospitalization, whereas women are more violent than men throughout the 3 days following a hospital admission. It has also been proven that mental disorders may be a consistent risk factor for the occurrence of violence. In order to better understand violent behaviors of patients with psychiatric disorders, it is important to investigate both the clinical symptoms and psychosocial factors that accompany violence in these patients. In this study, we utilized a dataset released by the Partners Healthcare and Neuropsychiatric Genome-scale and RDoC Individualized Domains project of Harvard Medical School to develop a unique text mining pipeline that processes unstructured clinical data in order to recognize clinical and social parameters such as age, gender, history of alcohol use, violent behaviors, etc., and explored the associations between these parameters and violent behaviors of patients with psychiatric disorders. The aim of our work was to demonstrate the feasibility of mining factors that are strongly associated with violent behaviors among psychiatric patients from unstructured psychiatric evaluation records using clinical text mining. Experiment results showed that stimulants, followed by a family history of violent behavior, suicidal behaviors, and financial stress were strongly associated with violent behaviors. Key aspects explicated in this paper include employing our text mining pipeline to extract clinical and social factors linked with violent behaviors, generating association rules to uncover possible associations between these factors and violent behaviors, and lastly the ranking of top rules associated with violent behaviors using statistical analysis and interpretation.

0.271292994,25572052,Positive association between serum silicon levels and bone mineral density in female rats following oral silicon supplementation with monomethylsilanetriol,"Summary Observational (epidemiological) studies suggest the positive association between dietary silicon intake and bone mineral density may be mediated by circulating estradiol level. Here, we report the results of a silicon supplementation study in rats that strongly support these observations and suggest an interaction between silicon and estradiol. Introduction Epidemiological studies report strong positive associations between dietary silicon (Si) intake and bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women and indicate that the association may be mediated by estradiol. We have tested this possibility in a mixed-gender rodent intervention study. Methods Tissue samples were obtained from three groups of 20-week-old Sprague Dawley rats (five males and five females per group) that had been supplemented ad libitum for 90¬†days in their drinking water with (i) <0.1¬†mg Si/L (vehicle control), (ii) 115¬†mg Si/L (moderate dose) or (iii) 575¬†mg Si/L (high dose). All rats received conventional laboratory feed, whilst supplemental Si was in the form of monomethylsilanetriol, increasing dietary Si intakes by 18 and 99¬†%, for the moderate- and high-dose groups, respectively. Results Fasting serum and tissue Si concentrations were increased with Si supplementation ( p <‚Äâ0.05), regardless of gender. However, only for female rats was there (i) a trend for a dose-responsive increase in serum osteocalcin concentration with Si intervention and (ii) strong significant associations between serum Si concentrations and measures of bone quality ( p <‚Äâ0.01). Correlations were weaker or insignificant for tibia Si levels and absent for other serum or tibia elemental concentrations and bone quality measures. Conclusions Our findings support the epidemiological observations that dietary Si positively impacts BMD in younger females, and this may be due to a Si-estradiol interaction. Moreover, these data suggest that the Si effect is mediated systemically, rather than through its incorporation into bone.

Materials and methods Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses were performed to detect the expression and subcellular localizations of CREB and pCREB proteins in 130 pairs of HCC and adjacent nonneoplastic liver tissues. Results Both immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses showed that the expression levels of CREB and pCREB proteins in HCC tissues were significantly higher than those in the adjacent nonneoplastic liver tissues (both P <0.001). In addition, the combined upregulation of CREB and pCREB proteins (CREB-high/pCREB-high) was significantly associated with serum Œ±-fetoprotein ( P =0.02), tumor stage ( P <0.001), and tumor grade ( P =0.01). Moreover, HCC patients with CREB-high/pCREB-high expression showed shortest 5-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival (both P <0.001). Furthermore, the multivariate survival analysis found that the combined upregulation of CREB and pCREB proteins may be an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for both 5-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival (both P =0.01) in HCC. Conclusion Our data indicate for the first time that the activation of the CREB protein may be associated with tumor progression in HCC, and may serve as a valuable marker of prognosis for patients with this malignancy.",OncoTargets and therapy,ONCO
0.83436684,17637668,The effect of ancient population bottlenecks on human phenotypic variation," The origin and patterns of dispersal of anatomically modern humans are the focus of considerable debate 1 - 3 . Global genetic analyses have argued for one single origin, placed somewhere in Africa 4 - 7 . This scenario implies a rapid expansion, with a series of bottlenecks of small amplitude, which would have led to the observed smooth loss of genetic diversity with increasing distance from Africa. Analyses of cranial data, on the other hand, have given mixed results 8 - 12 , and have been argued to support multiple origins of modern humans 2 , 9 , 12 . Using a large dataset of skull measurements and an analytical framework equivalent to the one used for genetic data, we show that the loss in genetic diversity has been mirrored by a loss in phenotypic variability. We find evidence for an African origin, placed somewhere in the central/southern part of the continent, which harbours the highest intra-population diversity in phenotypic traits. We failed to find evidence for a second origin and confirm these results on a large genetic dataset. Distance from Africa accounts for an average 19% - 25% of heritable variation in craniometric traits, a remarkably strong effect for phenotypic traits known to be under selection. ",Nature,ECO
0.105083479,19325934,The dynamic nature of cognition during wayfinding," Much of our day-to-day wayfinding behaviour takes place in familiar large-scale urban environments yet there is a dearth of studies examining how wayfinding unfolds on a second-by-second basis in this context. Here we used a retrospective verbal report protocol, eye-tracking and a highly accurate virtual reality simulation of a real city (London, UK) to examine this issue. Subjects, who were taxi drivers, were able to produce extremely detailed accounts of what they had been thinking during wayfinding, that were validated by independent eye-tracking data. There was a high degree of consistency in the types of thoughts across subjects, permitting classification into a number of distinct categories. Moreover, it was possible to quantify the number of thoughts in each category, their durations and temporal order. Detailed analysis of the verbal reports provided new insights into the processes and strategies involved, and highlighted a greater range of thoughts than has previously been reported in studies of wayfinding. By analyzing the temporal order of thoughts it was possible to identify specific relationships between categories. Some of these relationships were predicted by current cognitive models of wayfinding, others were novel, thus shedding new light on how navigation unfolds in a busy city.

0.831413293,26017140,Coupling of Zinc-Binding and Secondary Structure in Non-Fibrillar AŒ≤40 Peptide Oligomerization," Non-fibrillar neurotoxic amyloid Œ≤ (AŒ≤) oligomer structures are typically rich in Œ≤-sheets, which could be promoted by metal ions like Zn 2+ . Here, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we systematically examined combinations of AŒ≤40 peptide conformations and Zn 2+ binding modes to probe the effects of secondary structure on AŒ≤ dimerization energies and kinetics. We found that random conformations do not contribute to dimerization either thermodynamically or kinetically. Zn 2+ couples with preformed secondary structures (Œ±-helix and Œ≤-hairpin) to speed dimerization and stabilize the resulting dimer. Partial Œ±-helices increase the dimerization speed, and dimers with Œ±-helix rich conformations have the lowest energy. When Zn 2+ coordinates with residues D1, H6, H13, and H14, AŒ≤40 Œ≤-hairpin monomers have the fastest dimerization speed. Dimers with experimentally observed zinc coordination (E11, H6, H13, and H14) form with slower rate, but have lower energy. Zn 2+ cannot stabilize fibril-like Œ≤-arch dimer. However, Zn 2+ -bound Œ≤-arch tetramer has the lowest energy. Collectively, zinc-stabilized Œ≤-hairpin oligomers could be important in the nucleation-polymerization of cross-Œ≤ structures. Our results are consistent with experimental finding that Œ±-helix to Œ≤-structural transition should accompany AŒ≤ aggregation in the presence of zinc ions, and that Zn 2+ stabilizes non-fibrillar AŒ≤ oligomers, and thus inhibits formation of less toxic AŒ≤ fibrils.

Three classes of drugs: artemisinins, synthetic peroxides and DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) inhibitors effected potent inhibition of proliferation with IC 50 s in the nM- low ¬µM range, whereas a DHODH (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) and a putative kinase inhibitor displayed no activity. Furthermore, significant synergies were identified with erlotinib, imatinib, cisplatin, dasatinib and vincristine. Cluster analysis of the antimalarials based on their differential inhibition of the various cancer lines clearly segregated the synthetic peroxides OZ277 and OZ439 from the artemisinin cluster that included artesunate, dihydroartemisinin and artemisone, and from the DHFR inhibitors pyrimethamine and P218 (a parasite DHFR inhibitor), emphasizing their shared mode of action. In order to further understand the basis of the selectivity of these compounds against different cancers, microarray-based gene expression data for 85 of the used cell lines were generated. For each compound, distinct sets of genes were identified whose expression significantly correlated with compound sensitivity. Several of the antimalarials tested in this study have well-established and excellent safety profiles with a plasma exposure, when conservatively used in malaria, that is well above the IC 50 s that we identified in this study. Given their unique mode of action and potential for unique synergies with established anticancer drugs, our results provide a strong basis to further explore the potential application of these compounds in cancer in pre-clinical or and clinical settings.",PloS one,ONCO

Methods The study population included 429 culture-confirmed reported cases (January 1, 2004‚ÄìDecember 31, 2010). Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotyping data were used to identify cases likely due to recent transmission (clustered) versus reactivation (non-clustered). Poisson regression models estimated average decline rate in incidence over time and assessed the significance of differences between subpopulations. A multinomial logistic model examined differences between clustered and non-clustered incidence. Results A significant average annual percent decline was found for the overall incidence of culture-confirmed (9%; 95% CI: 5.5%, 16.9%), clustered (6%; 95% CI: 0.5%, 11.6%), and non-clustered tuberculosis cases (12%; 95% CI: 7.6%, 15.9%). However, declines varied among demographic groups. Significant declines in clustered incidence were only observed in males, non-Hispanic blacks, 65 years and older, and the rural population. Conclusions These findings suggest that the Arkansas tuberculosis control program must target both traditional and non-traditional risk groups for successful tuberculosis elimination. The present study also demonstrates that a thorough analysis of TB trends in different population subgroups of a given geographic region or state can lead to the identification of non-traditional risk factors for TB transmission. Similar studies in other low incidence populations would provide beneficial data for how to control and eventually eliminate TB in the U.S.",PloS one,EPIDEM
0.995092115,28648843,Identification of regulators of germ stem cell enwrapment by its niche in  C. elegans," Many stem cell niches contain support cells that increase contact with stem cells by enwrapping them in cellular processes. One example is the germ stem cell niche in C. elegans , which is composed of a single niche cell termed the distal tip cell (DTC) that extends cellular processes, constructing an elaborate plexus that enwraps germ stem cells. To identify genes required for plexus formation and to explore the function of this specialized enwrapping behavior, a series of targeted and tissue-specific RNAi screens were performed. Here we identify genes that promote stem cell enwrapment by the DTC plexus, including a set that specifically functions within the DTC, such as the chromatin modifier lin-40 /MTA1, and others that act within the germline, such as the 14-3-3 signaling protein par-5 . Analysis of genes that function within the germline to mediate plexus development reveal that they are required for expansion of the germ progenitor zone, supporting the emerging idea that germ stem cells signal to the niche to stimulate enwrapping behavior. Examination of wild-type animals with asymmetric plexus formation and animals with reduced DTC plexus elaboration via loss of two candidates including lin-40 indicate that cellular enwrapment promotes GLP-1/Notch signaling and germ stem cell fate. Together, our work identifies novel regulators of cellular enwrapment and suggests that reciprocal signaling between the DTC niche and the germ stem cells promotes enwrapment behavior and stem cell fate.

0.325049897,17008549,Annexin-1 modulates T-cell activation and differentiation," Annexin-1 is an anti-inflammatory protein that plays an important homeostatic role in innate immunity; however, its potential actions in the modulation of adaptive immunity have never been explored. Although inactive by itself, addition of annexin-1 to stimulated T cells augmented anti-CD3/CD28-mediated CD25 and CD69 expression and cell proliferation. This effect was paralleled by increased nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATs), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation and preceded by a rapid T-cell receptor (TCR)‚Äìinduced externalization of the annexin-1 receptor. Interestingly, differentiation of naive T cells in the presence of annexin-1 increased skewing in Th1 cells; in the collagen-induced arthritis model, treatment of mice with annexin-1 during the immunization phase exacerbated signs and symptoms at disease onset. Consistent with these findings, blood CD4 + cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed a marked up-regulation of annexin-1 expression. Together these results demonstrate that annexin-1 is a molecular ‚Äútuner‚Äù of TCR signaling and suggest this protein might represent a new target for the development of drugs directed to pathologies where an unbalanced Th1/Th2 response or an aberrant activation of T cells is the major etiologic factor.

In this cohort study of young IDU aged 18-30, we investigated the relationship between injection MA use and syringe sharing, and whether difficulty accessing sterile syringes mediated this association. Behavioral questionnaires were completed by 384 IDU in Vancouver, Canada between October 2005 and May 2008. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate direct and indirect effects. The median age of participants was 24 (IQR: 22‚Äì27) and 214 (55.7%) were male. Injecting MA was independently associated with syringe sharing. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulty accessing sterile syringes partially mediated the association between injecting MA and syringe sharing.

0.434761372,20941732,The Opsin Shift and Mechanism of Spectral Tuning of Rhodopsin," Molecular dynamics simulations and combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations have been performed to investigate the mechanism of the opsin shift and spectral tuning in rhodopsin. A red shift of ‚àí980 cm ‚àí1 was estimated in the transfer of the chromophore from methanol solution environment to the protonated Schiff base binding site of the opsin. The conformational change from a 6-s-cis-all-trans configuration in solution to the 6-s-cis-11-cis conformer contributes additional ‚àí200 cm ‚àí1 and the remaining effects were attributed to dispersion interactions with the aromatic residues in the binding site. An opsin shift of 2100 cm ‚àí1 was obtained, in reasonable accord with experiment (2730 cm ‚àí1 ). Dynamics simulations revealed that the 6-s-cis bond can occupy two main conformations for the Œ≤-ionone ring, resulting a weighted average dihedral angle of about 50¬∞, which may be compared with the experimental estimate of ‚àí28¬∞ from solid-state NMR and Raman data. We investigated a series of four single-mutations, including E113D, A292S, T118A and A269T, which are located near the protonated Schiff base, along the polyene chain of retinal and close to the ionone ring. The computational results on absorption energy shift provided insights into the mechanism of spectral tuning, which involves all means of electronic structural effects, including the stabilization or destabilization of either the ground or the electronically excited state of the retinal protonated Schiff base.

The materials were developed in 2 types, a booklet for face-to-face education and a handout for phone education. The booklet covered 4 topic areas of fatty liver, low-carbohydrate and low-simple sugar diet, weight control, and meal plan. The handout material included several eating behavior tips. To assess practical usability of nutrition education using the developed materials, subjective compliance and difficulty levels were examined in a sample for NAFLD patients. A total of 106 patients recruited from 5 general hospitals were randomly assigned to a low-carbohydrate and low-simple sugar weight control diet group or a general weight control diet group. Each participant received a 6-week nutrition education program consisting of a face-to-face education session and two sessions of phone education. The developed materials were used for the low-carbohydrate and low-simple sugar weight control diet group and general weight control information materials were used for the control group. Subjective difficulty and compliance levels were evaluated three times during the education period. Subjective difficulty level was significantly higher in the low-carbohydrate and low-simple sugar diet group compared to the control group at the end of the second week, but such a discrepancy disappeared afterward. No significant difference was found for subjective compliance between the groups at each time. In conclusion, the developed nutrition education materials for low-carbohydrate and low-simple sugar diet are reasonably applicable to general Korean NAFLD patients.",Clinical nutrition research,CLINIC

We recently showed that treatment with 15d-PGJ 2 induces apoptosis accompanied by downregulation of the oncogenic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signalling in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. The current study examines the effects of 15d-PGJ 2 on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Janus Kinase (JAK)-mediated signalling pathways. Inhibition of Stat3 by 15d-PGJ 2 was abolished by exogenous stimulation with transforming growth factor alpha (TGF- Œ± ), but not interleukin 6 (IL-6), supporting a selective effect of 15d-PGJ 2 on IL-6-mediated signalling. Importantly, 15d-PGJ 2 selectively abrogated constitutive and IL-6-mediated JAK phosphorylation without affecting EGFR-activated levels. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ 2 on JAK signalling required the reactive Œ± , Œ≤ -unsaturated carbon within the cyclopentenone ring. Targeting of JAK signalling using a specific JAK inhibitor also abolished Stat3 phosphorylation and resulted in apoptosis in oral SCC cells.

0.103851589,27199942,Effect of Biofilm Formation by  Oenococcus oeni  on Malolactic Fermentation and the Release of Aromatic Compounds in Wine,"The winemaking process involves the alcoholic fermentation of must, often followed by malolactic fermentation (MLF). The latter, mainly carried out by the lactic acid bacterium Oenococcus oeni , is used to improve wine quality when acidity reduction is required. Moreover, it prevents microbial spoilage and improves the wine‚Äôs organoleptic profile. Prior observations showed that O. oeni is able to resist several months in harsh wine conditions when adhered on oak barrels. Since biofilm is a prevailing microbial lifestyle in natural environments, the capacity of O. oeni to form biofilms was investigated on winemaking material such as stainless steel and oak chips. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy showed that O. oeni was able to adhere to these surfaces and form spatially organized microcolonies embedded in extracellular substances. To assess the competitive advantage of this mode of life in wine, the properties of biofilm and planktonic cells were compared after inoculation in a fermented must (pH 3.5 or 3.2 and 12% ethanol) The results indicated that the biofilm culture of O. oeni conferred (i) increased tolerance to wine stress, and (ii) functional performance with effective malolactic activities. Relative gene expression focusing on stress genes and genes involved in EPS synthesis was investigated in a mature biofilm and emphasized the role of the matrix in increased biofilm resistance. As oak is commonly used in wine aging, we focused on the O. oeni biofilm on this material and its contribution to the development of wine color and the release of aromatic compounds. Analytical chromatography was used to target the main oak aging compounds such as vanillin, gaiacol, eugenol, whisky-lactones, and furfural. The results reveal that O. oeni biofilm developed on oak can modulate the wood-wine transfer of volatile aromatic compounds during MLF and aging by decreasing furfural, gaiacol, and eugenol in particular. This work showed that O. oeni forms biofilms consisting of stress-tolerant cells capable of efficient MLF under winemaking conditions. Therefore surface-associated behaviors should be considered in the development of improved strategies for the control of MLF in wine.",Frontiers in microbiology,ANIMAL

Addition of hydroxide or fluoride to 1 produces two new complexes, 1-OH and 1-F . EPR and M√∂ssbauer studies show that both complexes have an S = ¬Ω ground state which results from antiferromagnetic coupling of the spins of a high-spin (S a = 5/2) Fe III and a high-spin (S b = 2) Fe IV site. 1-OH can also be obtained by a 1-electron reduction of 4 , which has been shown to have an Fe IV =O site. Radiolytic reduction of 4 at 77 K yields a M√∂ssbauer spectrum identical to that observed for 1-OH , showing that the latter contains an Fe IV =O. Interestingly, the Fe IV =O moiety has S b = 1 in 4 and S b = 2 in 1-OH and 1-F .

We investigated the impact of different zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs on green pea ( Pisum sativum L.), one of the highest consumed legumes globally. Pea plants were grown for 65 d in soil amended with commercially available bare ZnO NPs (10 nm), 2 wt% alumina doped (Al 2 O 3 @ZnO NPs, 15 nm), or 1 wt% aminopropyltriethoxysilane coated NPs (KH550@ZnO NP, 20 nm) at 250 and 1000 mg NP/kg soil inside a greenhouse. Bulk (ZnO) and ionic Zn (zinc chloride) were included as controls. Plant fresh and dry biomass, changes in leaf pigment concentrations, elements (Zn, Al, Si), and protein and carbohydrate profile of green pees were quantified upon harvest at 65 days. With the exception of the coated 1000 mg/kg NP treatment, fresh and dry weight were unaffected by Zn exposure. Although, all treated plants showed higher tissue Zn than controls, those exposed to Al 2 O 3 @ZnO NPs at 1000 mg/kg had greater Zn concentration in roots and seeds, compared to bulk Zn and the other NP treatments, keeping Al and Si uptake largely unaffected. Higher Zn accumulation in green pea seeds were resulted in coated ZnO at 250 mg/kg treatments. In leaves, Al 2 O 3 @ZnO NP at 250 mg/kg significantly increased Chl- a and carotenoid concentrations relative to the bulk, ionic, and the other NP treatments. The protein and carbohydrate profiles remained largely unaltered across all treatments with the exception of Al 2 O 3 @ZnO NPs at 1000 mg/kg where sucrose concentration of green peas increased significantly, which is likely a biomarker of stress. Importantly, these findings demonstrate that lattice and surface modification can significantly alter the fate and phytotoxic effects of ZnO NPs in food crops and seed nutritional quality.

Simulations of eighteen natural scenes under different daylight illuminants were presented on a high-resolution color monitor to seven deuteranomalous, seven protanomalous, and twelve normal trichromatic observers, who had to discriminate between reflectance and illuminant changes in the images. Observers' ability to judge surface color was quantified by a standard color-constancy index. Deuteranomalous trichromats performed as well as normal trichromats, but protanomalous trichromats performed more poorly than both.

Nematodes have potential for biomonitoring of the impact of commercial activity but the natural biodiversity is unknown. We investigate the feasibility of nematodes as biomonitoring organisms and give information about their natural biodiversity. Results The taxonomic composition (at family to genus level) of the nematode fauna in the abyssal Pacific is similar, but not identical to, the North Atlantic. Given the immature state of marine nematode taxonomy, it is not possible to comment on the commonality or otherwise of species between oceans. The between basin differences do not appear to be directly linked to current ecological factors. The abyssal Pacific region (including the Fracture Zone) could be divided into two biodiversity subregions that conform to variations in the linked factors of flux to the benthos and of sedimentary characteristics. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic-carbon flux. Despite high reported sample diversity, estimated regional diversity is less than 400 species.

0.667495475,25864635,Different functional neural substrates for good and poor language outcome in autism," Summary  Autism (ASD) is vastly heterogeneous, particularly in early language development. While ASD language trajectories in the first years of life are highly unstable, by early childhood these trajectories stabilize and are predictive of longer-term outcome. Early neural substrates that predict/precede such outcomes are largely unknown but could have considerable translational and clinical impact. Pre-diagnosis fMRI response to speech in ASD toddlers with relatively good language outcome was highly similar to non-ASD comparison groups and robustly recruited language-sensitive superior temporal cortices. In contrast, language-sensitive superior temporal cortices were hypoactive in ASD toddlers with poor language outcome. Brain-behavioral relationships were atypically reversed in ASD and a multimodal combination of pre-diagnostic clinical behavioral measures and speech-related fMRI response showed the most promise as an ASD prognosis classifier. Thus, before ASD diagnoses and outcome become clinically clear, distinct functional neuroimaging phenotypes are already present that can shed insight on an ASD toddler‚Äôs later outcome.

Current treatments include oral contraceptives combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or surgery to remove lesions, all of which provide a temporary but not complete cure. Here we identify an endometriosis-targeting peptide that is internalized by cells, designated z13, using phage display. As most endometriosis occurs on organ surfaces facing the peritoneum, we subtracted a phage display library with female mouse peritoneum tissue and selected phage clones by binding to human endometrial epithelial cells. Proteomics analysis revealed the z13 receptor as the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel Œ≤3, a sorting pathway protein. We then linked z13 with an apoptosis-inducing peptide and with an endosome-escaping peptide. When these peptides were co-administered into the peritoneum of baboons with endometriosis, cells in lesions selectively underwent apoptosis with no effect on neighbouring organs. Thus, this study presents a strategy that could be useful to treat peritoneal endometriosis in humans.  Endometriosis is a painful condition in which endometrial cells are found outside the womb.

In BRAF V600E-mutant cases, paired plasma DNA was tested for mutation status of BRAF V600E and EGFR. The distribution and prognostic role of BRAF V600E mutations were analyzed using SPSS 13.0. Results Among 190 patients with advanced lung ADC, eight (4.2%) cases carried BRAF V600E mutations. V600E mutations presented more frequently in women than in men (6 of 96, 6.3% vs. P = 0.1). BRAF and EGFR mutations were concomitantly presented in three patients. Five of the eight patients with BRAF V600E mutations had matched plasma DNA samples and V600E mutations were found in three plasma samples. Conclusion The prevalence of BRAF V600E mutations in Chinese patients with lung ADC is 4.2%. Circulating plasma DNA may be used for BRAF V600E mutation analysis in lung adenocarcinoma.",Thoracic cancer,ONCO
0.903206529,28129942,Characterization of U.S. state laws requiring health care provider reporting of perinatal substance use,"  Background  State policies pertaining to health care provider reporting of perinatal substance use have implications for provider screening and referral behavior, patients‚Äô care-seeking and access to prenatal substance use disorder treatment, and pregnancy and birth outcomes.    Objectives  To characterize specific provisions enacted in state statutes pertaining to mandates that health care providers report perinatal substance use, and to determine the proportion of births occurring in states with such laws.    Methods  We conducted a systematic content analysis of statutes in all U.S. states that mentioned reporting by health care providers of substance use by pregnant women or infants exposed to substances in utero; inter-rater reliability was high. We calculated the number of states, and proportion of U.S. births occurring in states, with processes for mandatory reporting of perinatal substance use to authorities, and substance use disorder treatment provision for individuals who are reported.    Results  Twenty states (corresponding to 31% of births) had laws requiring health care providers to report perinatal substance use to child protective authorities, and four states (18% of births) had laws requiring reporting only when a health care provider believed the substance use was associated with child maltreatment. About half of states (13) with any reporting law had a provision promoting substance use disorder treatment in the perinatal period.    Conclusions  Findings inform the ongoing debate about how health policies may be used to reduce the population burden of perinatal substance use.

0.943681172,22163826,An Enhanced Reservation-Based MAC Protocol for IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,"The IEEE 802.15.4 Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is an enabling standard for wireless sensor networks. In order to support applications requiring dedicated bandwidth or bounded delay, it provides a reservation-based scheme named Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS). However, the GTS scheme presents some drawbacks, such as inefficient bandwidth utilization and support to a maximum of only seven devices. This paper presents eLPRT (enhanced Low Power Real Time), a new reservation-based MAC protocol that introduces several performance enhancing features in comparison to the GTS scheme. This MAC protocol builds on top of LPRT (Low Power Real Time) and includes various mechanisms designed to increase data transmission reliability against channel errors, improve bandwidth utilization and increase the number of supported devices. A motion capture system based on inertial and magnetic sensors has been used to validate the protocol. The effectiveness of the performance enhancements introduced by each of the new features is demonstrated through the provision of both simulation and experimental results.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",ENG
0.579116785,22654791,"Early Diagnosis of Werner's Syndrome Using Exome-Wide Sequencing in a Single, Atypical Patient","Genetic diagnosis of inherited metabolic disease is conventionally achieved through syndrome recognition and targeted gene sequencing, but many patients receive no specific diagnosis. Next-generation sequencing allied to capture of expressed sequences from genomic DNA now offers a powerful new diagnostic approach. Barriers to routine diagnostic use include cost, and the complexity of interpreting results arising from simultaneous identification of large numbers of variants. We applied exome-wide sequencing to an individual, 16-year-old daughter of consanguineous parents with a novel syndrome of short stature, severe insulin resistance, ptosis, and microcephaly. Pulldown of expressed sequences from genomic DNA followed by massively parallel sequencing was undertaken. Single nucleotide variants were called using SAMtools prior to filtering based on sequence quality and existence in control genomes and exomes. Of 485 genetic variants predicted to alter protein sequence and absent from control data, 24 were homozygous in the patient. One mutation ‚Äì the p.Arg732X mutation in the WRN gene ‚Äì has previously been reported in Werner's syndrome (WS). On re-evaluation of the patient several early features of WS were detected including loss of fat from the extremities and frontal hair thinning. Lymphoblastoid cells from the proband exhibited a defective decatenation checkpoint, consistent with loss of WRN activity. We have thus diagnosed WS some 15‚Äâyears earlier than average, permitting aggressive prophylactic therapy and screening for WS complications, illustrating the potential of exome-wide sequencing to achieve early diagnosis and change management of rare autosomal recessive disease, even in individual patients of consanguineous parentage with apparently novel syndromes.",Frontiers in endocrinology,CLINIC
0.834787926,22578508,Neural Mechanisms Underlying Paradoxical Performance for Monetary Incentives Are Driven by Loss Aversion,"Summary Employers often make payment contingent on performance in order to motivate workers. We used fMRI with a novel incentivized skill task to examine the neural processes underlying behavioral responses to performance-based pay. We found that individuals' performance increased with increasing incentives; however, very high incentive levels led to the paradoxical consequence of worse performance. Between initial incentive presentation and task execution, striatal activity rapidly switched between activation and deactivation in response to¬†increasing incentives. Critically, decrements in performance and striatal deactivations were directly predicted by an independent measure of behavioral loss aversion. These results suggest that incentives associated with successful task performance are initially encoded as a potential gain; however, when actually performing a task, individuals encode the potential loss that would arise from failure. Highlights ‚ñ∫ Very high monetary incentives result in poor behavioral performance ‚ñ∫ During incentive presentation, striatal activity increases with increasing incentives ‚ñ∫ During task performance, striatal activity decreases with increasing incentives ‚ñ∫ Performance and striatal responses are predicted by behavioral loss aversion Chib et¬†al. find that very large financial incentives can lead to the paradoxical response of poor work performance.

0.260544583,26960367,Three-dimensional Evaluation of Nasal Surgery in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder and is characterized by airway collapse at multiple levels of upper airway. The effectiveness of nasal surgery has been discussed in several studies and shows a promising growing interest. In this study, we intended to evaluate the effects of nasal surgery on the upper airway dimensions in patients with OSA using three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of cone-beam computed tomography (CT). Methods: Twelve patients with moderate to severe OSA who underwent nasal surgery were included in this study. All patients were diagnosed with OSA using polysomnography (PSG) in multi sleep health centers associated with Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and the Partners Health Care from May 31, 2011 to December 14, 2013. The effect of nasal surgery was evaluated by the examination of PSG, subjective complains, and 3D reconstructed CT scan. Cross-sectional area was measured in eleven coronal levels, and nasal cavity volume was evaluated from anterior nasal spine to posterior nasal spine. The thickness of soft tissue in oral pharynx region was also measured. Results: Five out of the 12 patients were successfully treated by nasal surgery, with more than 50% drop of apnea‚Äìhypopnea index. All the 12 patients showed significant increase of cross-sectional area and volume postoperatively. The thickness of soft tissue in oral pharynx region revealed significant decrease postoperatively, which decreased from 19.14 ¬± 2.40 cm 2 and 6.11 ¬± 1.76 cm 2 to 17.13 ¬± 1.91 cm 2 and 5.22 ¬± 1.20 cm 2 .

0.107767287,25118967,THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING RAPID HIV TESTING IN SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES CLINICS IN THE UNITED STATES,"  Introduction  Rapid HIV testing in high-risk populations can increase the number of persons who learn their HIV status and avoid spending clinic resources to locate persons identified as HIV-infected.    Methods  We determined the cost to sexually transmitted disease clinics of point-of-care rapid HIV testing using data from 7 public clinics that participated in a randomized trial of rapid testing with and without brief patient-centered risk-reduction counseling in 2010. Costs included counselor and trainer time, supplies, and clinic overhead. We applied national labor rates and test costs. We calculated median clinic start-up costs and mean cost per patient tested, and projected incremental annual costs of implementing universal rapid HIV testing compared to current testing practices.    Results  Criteria for offering rapid HIV testing and methods for delivering non-rapid test results varied among clinics prior to the trial. Rapid HIV testing cost an average of $22/patient without brief risk-reduction counseling and $46/patient with counseling in these 7 clinics. Median start-up costs per clinic were $1,100 and $16,100 without and with counseling, respectively. Estimated incremental annual costs per clinic of implementing universal rapid HIV testing varied by whether or not brief counseling is conducted and by current clinic testing practices, ranging from a savings of $19,500 to a cost of $40,700 without counseling and a cost of $98,000 to $153,900 with counseling.    Conclusions  Universal rapid HIV testing in sexually transmitted disease clinics with same day results can be implemented at relatively low cost to STD clinics, if brief risk-reduction counseling is not offered.

We carried out a case‚Äìcontrol study to investigate the effect of mammography service screening, in the NHS breast screening programme, on breast cancer mortality in the East Anglian region of the UK. Cases were deaths from breast cancer in women diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 70 years, following the instigation of the East Anglia Breast Screening Programme in 1989. The controls were women (two per case) who had not died of breast cancer, from the same area, matched by date of birth to the cases. Each control was known to be alive at the time of death of her matched case. All women were known to the breast screening programme and were invited, at least once, to be screened. There were 284 cases and 568 controls. The odds ratio (OR) for risk of death from breast cancer in women who attended at least one routine screen compared to those who did not attend was 0.35 (CI: 0.24, 0.50). Adjusting for self-selection bias gave an estimate of the breast cancer mortality reduction associated with invitation to screening of 35% (OR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.88). The effect of actually being screened was a 48% breast cancer mortality reduction (OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.84). The results suggest that the National Breast Screening Programme in East Anglia is achieving a reduction in breast cancer deaths, which is at least consistent with the results from the randomised controlled trials of mammographic screening.",British journal of cancer,ONCO

We investigated whether observed pupil size modulates our perception of other‚Äôs emotional expressions and examined the central mechanisms modulated by incidental perception of pupil size in emotional facial expressions. We show that diminishing pupil size enhances ratings of emotional intensity and valence for sad, but not happy, angry or neutral facial expressions. This effect was associated with modulation of neural activity within cortical and subcortical regions implicated in social cognition. In an identical context, we show that the observed pupil size was mirrored by the observers‚Äô own pupil size. This empathetic contagion engaged the brainstem pupillary control nuclei (Edinger‚ÄìWestphal) in proportion to individual subject‚Äôs sensitivity to this effect. These findings provide evidence that perception‚Äìaction mechanisms extend to non-volitional operations of the autonomic nervous system. ",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,NEURO
0.87367861,24511469,Antioxidant Supplementation Reduces Genomic Aberrations in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,"Summary Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using oncogenic transcription factors. However, this method leads to genetic aberrations in iPSCs via unknown mechanisms, which may limit their clinical use. Here, we demonstrate that the supplementation of growth media with antioxidants reduces the genome instability of cells transduced with the reprogramming factors. Antioxidant supplementation did not affect transgene expression level or silencing kinetics. Importantly, iPSCs made with antioxidants had significantly fewer de novo copy number variations, but not fewer coding point mutations, than iPSCs made without antioxidants. Our results suggest that the quality and safety of human iPSCs might be enhanced by using antioxidants in the growth media during the generation and maintenance of iPSCs. Graphical Abstract Highlights ‚Ä¢ During reprogramming, oxidative stress is elevated ‚Ä¢ Antioxidants reduce genome instability during reprogramming ‚Ä¢ iPSCs made in the presence of antioxidants have fewer de novo genomic aberrations iPSCs may find important applications in personalized regenerative medicine, but the elevated mutation load associated with their generation is a barrier to clinical use.

0.084195615,29954360,Measuring sexual behaviour in Malawi: a triangulation of three data collection instruments,"Background There is a need for valid approaches to measure sexual interactions to assess the impact of behavioural interventions and to predict the impact of behaviour changes. Different methods of asking about sexual behaviour often yield conflicting answers and men often report higher levels of heterosexual activity than women. To better understand self-reported sexual behaviour data and how best to collect it, we analyzed data collected as part of a larger project (ST IMPACTS) on the social and behavioural impact of introducing community-level HIV self-testing (HIVST) with counseling (semi-supervised with pre- and generic post-test counseling provided on delivery or collection of test kits) in an urban Malawian setting. Methods Information on sexual behaviour was collected from HIV self-testers over a three-month period. Three different methods were used: retrospective face-to-face interviews (FTFI); audio computer assisted self-interviews (ACASI) and a prospective coital diary. Both retrospective instruments were used before and after the three-month study period. Frequency and cross-tabulation, as well as scatterplots, were used for exploratory analyses. Chi-square tests were used to test for differences in proportions. Spearman‚Äôs correlation coefficient was used to explore associations between both continuous and ordinal variables and Wilcoxon‚Äôs paired sample and Mann-Whitney test was used to test for differences in such variables or between variables. Results There was reasonable agreement between the two retrospective methods although both yielded inconsistent answers e.g. with lower reported numbers of life-time sexual partners at the end than at the beginning of the study period. The diary method elicited higher reported levels of sex with multiple partners than both retrospective instruments which may be due to inadequate recall. Over the study period 37.4% of men and 19.7% of women reported multiple sexual partners using the diary. There was no clear relationship between reported sexual behaviour and HIV status (prevalence 9.6%). Conclusions Diaries may therefore have higher validity for sensitive behaviour reporting and thus be the preferred method in similar African contexts in measuring sexual behaviours.

0.461527322,31459671,Physicochemical Properties Govern the Activity of Potent Antiviral Flavones,"Ladanein (i.e., 5,6,7-trihydroxylated flavone) was demonstrated to act as a powerful virucidal agent toward a broad range of enveloped virus particles. Fe(III) coordination and pH are indeed among the key parameters that might favor both bioactivation of the flavone and consequent host cell entry inhibition. In this present work, the impact of fluorinated groups on the physicochemical and antiviral properties of the flavone was investigated, thus allowing a deeper understanding of the antiviral mode of action. The improved synthesis of ladanein allowed accessing a broad range of analogues, some of them being significantly more active than the former ladanein lead compound. We first determined the acido-basic properties of this homogenous series of compounds and then investigated their electrochemical behavior. Fe(III) coordination properties (stability, spectral behavior, and kinetics) of ladanein and its analogues were then examined (quasiphysiological conditions) and provided key information of their stability and reactivity. Using the determined physicochemical parameters, the critical impact of the iron complexation and medium acidity was confirmed on hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles (pre)treated with ladanein. Finally, a preliminary structure‚ÄìHCV entry inhibition relationship study evidenced the superior antiviral activity of the ladanein analogues bearing an electron-withdrawing group in para position ( FCF 3 > FOCF 3 > FFCF 3 > FF > FOMe ) on the B cycle in comparison with the parent ladanein itself.",ACS omega,BIOCHEM
0.317655322,29544120,Educational differences in alcohol consumption and heavy drinking: An age-period-cohort perspective *,"  Background  Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with lower alcohol consumption, but also with heavier drinking. To explain this contradictory relationship, we examined SES differences in drinking patterns from an age-period-cohort (APC) perspective.    Methods  Data are from seven waves of the U.S. National Alcohol Surveys from 1979 to 2010. As a proxy for SES, educational attainment was used. Past-year alcohol volume was calculated from frequency (never-to-every day) and usual quantity (1‚Äì2, 3‚Äì4, or 5‚Äì6 drinks). Past-year frequency of heavy episodic drinking was labelled as total days of 5+ drinks. Gender-stratified APC fixed-effects models were conducted controlling for demographics and adjusting for survey design and weights.    Results  Significant APC effects by education were found, but the direction varied by alcohol measure. Education and total volume were positively associated across APC. Cross-over effects for age occurred with a positive education-heavy drinking relationship in young adulthood and negative relationship in mid-adulthood. Cohort-by-education effects showed greater heavy drinking among less educated women in 1956‚Äì60 cohort and more educated men and women in younger cohorts (post-1976).    Conclusions  Higher SES is consistently associated with total volume across age, period, and cohort, but less consistently with heavy drinking. While there are currently significant intervention efforts to reduce heavy drinking in young adulthood, our study suggests the need for age-specific strategies targeting lower-SES groups in mid -adulthood and cohort-specific strategies for lower-SES women in the baby boomer cohort and higher-SES men and women in younger birth cohorts.

0.280478563,21996742,Lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine-1-phosphate promote morphogenesis and block invasion of prostate cancer cells in three-dimensional organotypic models,"Normal prostate and some malignant prostate cancer (PrCa) cell lines undergo acinar differentiation and form spheroids in three-dimensional (3-D) organotypic culture. Acini formed by PC-3 and PC-3M, less pronounced also in other PrCa cell lines, spontaneously undergo an invasive switch, leading to the disintegration of epithelial structures and the basal lamina, and formation of invadopodia. This demonstrates the highly dynamic nature of epithelial plasticity, balancing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition against metastable acinar differentiation. This study assessed the role of lipid metabolites on epithelial maturation. PC-3 cells completely failed to form acinar structures in delipidated serum. Adding back lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) rescued acinar morphogenesis and repressed invasion effectively. Blocking LPA receptor 1 (LPAR1) functions by siRNA (small interference RNA) or the specific LPAR1 inhibitor Ki16425 promoted invasion, while silencing of other G-protein-coupled receptors responsive to LPA or S1P mainly caused growth arrest or had no effects. The G-proteins GŒ± 12/13 and GŒ± i were identified as key mediators of LPA signalling via stimulation of RhoA and Rho kinases ROCK1 and 2, activating Rac1, while inhibition of adenylate cyclase and accumulation of cAMP may be secondary. Interfering with these pathways specifically impeded epithelial polarization in transformed cells. In contrast, blocking the same pathways in non-transformed, normal cells promoted differentiation. We conclude that LPA and LPAR1 effectively promote epithelial maturation and block invasion of PrCa cells in 3-D culture. The analysis of clinical transcriptome data confirmed reduced expression of LPAR1 in a subset of PrCa's. Our study demonstrates a metastasis-suppressor function for LPAR1 and GŒ± 12/13 signalling, regulating cell motility and invasion versus epithelial maturation.",Oncogene,ONCO
0.320974124,16484049,Formation of singlet oxygen from solutions of vitamin E," Vitamin E offers protection against oxidative stress and is an efficient quencher of singlet oxygen. A recent report suggests that photo-excitation of vitamin E results in the formation of a triplet state (Naqvi et al, Photochem.Photobiol.Sci. 2, 381 (2003)). This leads to the possibility of the triplet state of vitamin E being able to sensitize singlet oxygen and if this is the case it would be counter productive in terms of the biological protective function of vitamin E. We report the production of singlet oxygen, detected by 1270 nm luminescence, from pulsed laser excitation (308 nm) of vitamin E and an analogue, 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-hydroxy-chroman (PMHC), with quantum yields between ‚àº0.1 to 0.2. The luminescence was identified as singlet oxygen from self quenching by vitamin E with solvent-dependent rate constants similar to published values. Whilst the beneficial antioxidant aspects of vitamin E are well established, these results indicate that vitamin E when directly excited can sensitize singlet oxygen formation and may therefore be capable of inducing biochemical and biological damage. The results are discussed in relation to recent reports on the deleterious effects of vitamin E dietary supplementation and pro-oxidant effects of vitamin E. ",Free radical research,BIOCHEM

A comparison of different indicators of social disparity among the Inuit in Greenland,"The purpose of the article is to compare different indicators of social position as measures of social inequality in health in a population sample from an indigenous arctic people, the Inuit in Greenland. Data was collected during 2005‚Äì2015 and consisted of information from 3967 adult Inuit from towns and villages in all parts of Greenland. Social inequalities for smoking and central obesity were analysed in relation to seven indicators of social disparity in four dimensions, i.e. education and employment, economic status, sociocultural position, and place of residence. For each indicator we calculated age-adjusted prevalence by social group, rate ratio and the concentration index. The indicators were correlated with Pearson‚Äôs r ranging from 0.24 to 0.82. Concentration indices ranged from 0.01 to 0.17. We could not conclude that one indicator was superior to others. Most of the indicators were traditional socioeconomic indicators used extensively in research in western countries and these seemed to be useful among the Inuit too, in particular household assets and job. Two sociocultural indicators developed for use among the Inuit and which included parameters specific to the indigenous peoples in the transition from a traditional to a modern life style proved to be equally useful but not superior to the traditional socioeconomic indicators. The choice of indicator must depend on what it is realistic to collect in the actual research setting and the use of more than one indicator is recommended. It is suggested to further develop culture specific indicators of social position for indigenous peoples. Highlights ‚Ä¢ Conventional socioeconomic indicators estimate inequality in health among the Inuit. ‚Ä¢ Culture sensitive indices of social transition are equally useful but not superior. ‚Ä¢ Daily smoking is inversely associated with social position. ‚Ä¢ Among men waist obesity is directly associated with social position.",SSM - population health,EPIDEM

Design Cost effectiveness analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial with a one month follow-up. Setting Primary care. Participants 309 non-pregnant adult women aged 18-70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection. Interventions Patients were randomised to five basic management approaches: empirical antibiotics, empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics, or targeted antibiotics based on either a high symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, smell, nocturia, dysuria), dipstick results (nitrite or leucocytes and blood), or receipt of a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Main outcome measure Duration of symptoms and cost of care. Results Management with targeted antibiotics with midstream urine analysis was more costly over the period of one month. Costs for the midstream urine analysis and dipstick management groups were ¬£37 and ¬£35, respectively; these compared with ¬£31 for immediate antibiotics. Cost effectiveness acceptability curves suggested that if avoiding a day of moderately bad symptoms was valued at less than ¬£10, then immediate antibiotics is likely to be the most cost effective strategy. For values over ¬£10, targeted antibiotics with dipstick testing becomes the most cost effective strategy, though because of the uncertainty we can never be more than 70% certain that this strategy truly is the most cost effective. Conclusion Dipstick testing with targeted antibiotics is likely to be cost effective if the value of saving a day of moderately bad symptoms is ¬£10 or more, but caution is required given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the estimates.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),CLINIC

It is well known that if these unobserved functional outcomes are not handled properly, biased treatment comparisons can be produced. In this paper, we propose a procedure for comparing treatments that is based on a composite endpoint that combines information on both the functional outcome and survival. We further propose a missing data imputation scheme and sensitivity analysis strategy to handle the unobserved functional outcomes not due to death. Illustrations of the proposed method are given by analyzing data from a recent non-small cell lung cancer clinical trial and a recent trial of sedation interruption among mechanically ventilated patients.

Patients and methods A retrospective review was performed for all infants with PUVs who were treated between 1990 and 2010. In all, 52 infants were identified to have LBW and/or delivered preterm (Group 1). Infants in Group 1 were compared with a matching group (Group 2) of 60 full-term normal birth weight (NBW) infants with PUVs managed during the same period. The outcome of both groups was analysed. Results During follow-up, CKD developed in 17 (32.5%) and 22 patients (36.5%) in Groups 1 and 2, respectively ( P =¬†0.812). Patients with LBW or delivered preterm had significantly higher incidence of oligohydramnios ( P =¬†0.009), increased risk of vesicostomy ( P <¬†0.001), longer hospital stay ( P <¬†0.001), and higher incidence of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR, P =¬†0.024).

Methods Eight healthy males ingested either BAl (4.8¬†g¬†day ‚àí1 for 4¬†weeks, increased to 6.4¬†g¬†day ‚àí1 for 2¬†weeks) or placebo (Pl) (CaCO 3 ) for 6¬†weeks, in a crossover design (6-week washout between supplements). After each chronic supplementation period participants performed two trials, each consisting of two intense exercise tests performed over consecutive days. Trials were separated by 1¬†week and consisted of a repeated sprint ability (RSA) test and cycling capacity test at 110¬†% Wmax (CCT 110¬†% ). Placebo (Pl) or SB (300¬†mg¬†kgbw ‚àí1 ) was ingested prior to exercise in a crossover design to creating four supplement conditions (BAl-Pl, BAl-SB, Pl‚ÄìPl, Pl-SB). Results Carnosine increased in the gastrocnemius ( n =¬†5) ( p =¬†0.03) and soleus ( n =¬†5) ( p =¬†0.02) following BAl supplementation, and Pl-SB and BAl-SB ingestion elevated blood HCO 3 ‚àí concentrations ( p <¬†0.01).

We aimed to analyze left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) after diagnosis of an LVEF ‚â§35% during optimization of heart failure drug therapy. Methods and Results One hundred fifty‚Äêsix patients with newly diagnosed LVEF ‚â§35% receiving a wearable cardioverter/defibrillator ( WCD ) were analyzed. WCD was prescribed for 3¬†months until first re‚Äêevaluation. Indications for prolongation of WCD wearing period instead of ICD implantation were: (1) LVEF at 3‚Äêmonth visit 30% to 35%; (2) increase in LVEF of ‚â•5% compared to the last visit; and (3) nonoptimized heart failure medication. Mean LVEF was 24¬±7% at diagnosis and 39¬±11% at last follow‚Äêup (mean, 12¬±10¬†months). Whereas 88 patients presented a primary preventive ICD indication ( LVEF ‚â§35%) at 3‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup, only 58 showed a persistent primary preventive ICD indication at last follow‚Äêup. This delayed improvement in LVEF was related to nonischemic origin of cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association functional class at baseline, heart rate, better LVEF after 3¬†months, and higher dosages of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Twelve appropriate WCD shocks for ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation occurred in 11 patients. Two patients suffered from ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation beyond 3¬†months after diagnosis. Conclusions A relevant proportion of patients with newly diagnosed heart failure shows recovery of LVEF >35% beyond 3¬†months after initiation of heart failure therapy. To avoid untimely ICD implantation, prolongation of WCD period should be considered in these patients to prevent sudden cardiac death while allowing left ventricular reverse remodeling during intensified drug therapy.",Journal of the American Heart Association,CLINIC
0.714099703,28032661,Evolutionary constraints on human object perception," Language and culture endow humans with access to conceptual information that far exceeds any which could be accessed by a non-human animal. Yet, it is possible that, even without language or specific experiences, non-human animals represent and infer some aspects of similarity relations between objects in the same way as humans. Here we show that monkeys‚Äô discrimination sensitivity when identifying images of animals is predicted by established measures of semantic similarity derived from human conceptual judgments. We used metrics from computer vision and computational neuroscience to show that monkeys' and humans' performance cannot be explained by low-level visual similarity alone. The results demonstrate that at least some of the underlying structure of object representations in humans is shared with non-human primates, at an abstract level that extends beyond low-level visual similarity. Because the monkeys had no experience with the objects we tested, the results suggest that monkeys and humans share a primitive representation of object similarity that is independent of formal knowledge and cultural experience, and likely derived from common evolutionary constraints on object representation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the use of contraception during the most recent intercourse as well as the reproductive intentions of Swedish‚Äêspeaking women requesting contraceptive counseling. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross‚Äêsectional baseline survey in a randomized controlled trial regarding reproductive life planning (before randomization). Women requesting contraceptive counseling answered questions about contraception and whether they wanted to have children/more children in the future. Results In total, 1946 women participated: 33.7% (n = 656) parous and 65.7% (n = 1279) nulliparous. The majority, 87.1% (n = 1682), had used contraception during their latest intercourse; 64.6% (n = 1239) used short‚Äêacting reversible contraception, 22.8% (n = 443) used long‚Äêacting reversible contraception (LARC), and 12.9% (n = 251) had not used any contraception. A combined oral contraceptive was more common among nulliparous and LARC among parous. Among all women, 64.8% (n = 1253) intended to have children/more children in the future, among parous women 35.7% (n = 220) and among nulliparous 80.0% (n = 1033). Among women who did not intend to have children/more children, 22.6% (n = 60) of parous and 10% (n = 8) of nulliparous had not used contraceptives during their most recent intercourse. Conclusions Women did not always use contraceptives that were suitable for their reproductive intentions. Questioning women who request contraceptive counseling about their pregnancy intention can give healthcare providers better opportunities for individualized counseling.",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,CLINIC
0.863485919,29093179,A distinct hematopoietic stem cell population for rapid multilineage engraftment in nonhuman primates," Hematopoietic reconstitution after bone marrow transplantation is thought to be driven by committed and multipotent progenitor cells followed by long-term engrafting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we observed a population of early-engrafting cells displaying HSC-like behavior, which persisted long-term in vivo in an autologous myeloablative transplant model in nonhuman primates. To identify this population, we characterized the phenotype and function of defined nonhuman primate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) subsets and compared these to human HSPCs. We demonstrate that the phenotype of CD34 + CD45RA - CD90 + cells is highly enriched for HSCs. Most importantly, this population fully supported rapid short-term recovery and robust multilineage hematopoiesis in the nonhuman primate transplant model, and quantitatively predicted transplant success and time to neutrophil and platelet recovery. Application of this cell population has potential in the setting of HSC transplantation and gene therapy/editing.   One Sentence Summary:  A population of hematopoietic stem cells with superior engraftment and repopulating abilities has been identified in nonhuman primates.    Accessible Summary:  The gold standard target cell population for stem cell gene therapy and transplantion of stem cell enriched grafts are CD34 + cells. However, most of the cells within this population will not contribute to engraftment. Using a robust nonhuman primate transplantation model, we identified a stem cell-enriched sub-phenotype of CD34 + cells which is exclusively responsible for engraftment. Cell doses of this phenotype correlated with neutrophil and platelet engraftment and reliably predicted transplant success. Importantly, we observed phenotypic and transcriptomic similarity of these cells to human cells. These data suggest a refined cell population with potential in transplantation including gene therapy/editing approaches.  ",Science translational medicine,ANIMAL

0.809860268,29456719,Estrogen receptor-Œ± promoter methylation is a biomarker for outcome prediction of cisplatin resistance in triple-negative breast cancer,"A number of previous studies have indicated the presence of a link between estrogen receptor-Œ± (ERŒ±) methylation and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the association between ERŒ± methylation and drug resistance during the treatment of TNBC remains unclear. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate the methylation of ERŒ± in the genomic DNA of 35 patients with TNBC who were defined as cisplatin-based chemotherapy-resistant using chemosensitivity testing. Survival probabilities by covariates were assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimator survival analysis and Cox's proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node metastasis and ERŒ± promoter DNA methylation. Of the 35 patients with TNBC analyzed, 8 exhibited ERŒ± promoter DNA methylation. Cisplatin resistance was confirmed to be overwhelmingly associated with ERŒ± methylation by univariate and multivariate analysis. Even in a limited analysis in patients with ERŒ± methylation, the results generated from methylated tumor tissue and unmethylated tumor tissue revealed that expression of breast cancer type 1/2 susceptibility proteins was increased in ERŒ±-methylated breast tumor tissue compared with in unmethylated tissue. The ERŒ± methylation group tended to have significantly shorter progression-free (P=0.010) and overall (P=0.023) survival times compared with those in the unmethylated group. Similarly, shorter progression-free (P=0.024) and overall (P=0.018) survival times were observed in the cisplatin-resistant group compared with the cisplatin-non-resistant group. ERŒ± methylation predicts a poor clinical outcome for patients with TNBC. The results of the present study indicated that ERŒ± methylation may be a candidate surrogate biomarker for outcome prediction and cisplatin resistance in TNBC.

0.745009423,21122128,An assessment of early diagnosis and treatment of malaria by village health volunteers in the Lao PDR,"Background Early diagnosis and treatment (EDAT) is crucial to reducing the burden of malaria in low-income countries. In the Lao PDR, this strategy was introduced in 2004-2005 and an assessment was performed at the community level in January 2007. Methods EDAT with malaria rapid diagnostic test (MRDT) and artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) was prospectively assessed among 36 randomized village health volunteers (VHVs) and 720 patients in six malaria-endemic provinces of Laos (three pilot provinces (PP), and three non-pilots provinces (NPP)). ACT was also retrospectively assessed among 2188 patients within the same areas from June to November 2006. Two checklists were used and scores were calculated. Results EDAT performance of the VHVs was rated better in PP than in NPP (16.67% versus 38.89%, respectively, p = 0.004). Nearly all VHVs could diagnose malaria but only 16 (44%) could describe the symptoms of severe malaria. In January 2007, 31/720 (4%) patients tested positive using the Paracheck ¬Æ test, 35 (5%) with microscopy (sensibility: 74.3%, specificity 99.3%, positive and negative predictive values: 83.9% and 98.7%, respectively). Patients from June to November were at higher risk of malaria: 35.19% of 2,188 febrile patients were positive (OR: 10.6, 95%CI: 7.4-15.5, p < 0.000). VHVs reported the MRDT easy to use, and yielded a satisfactory performance score. EDAT performance was rated as poor despite satisfactory results regarding ACT treatment, duration and dosages. Pre-referral treatment of severe malaria was infrequent and often inadequate, with 20% of these patients dying. Results suggest a higher mortality from severe malaria than officially reported. Shortage of ACT was frequent. Discussion and conclusion MRDT and ACT are useful and efficient and can be used by VHVs. VHVs' global EDAT performance is enhanced through training and monitoring. Persistent gaps in knowledge, care of patients and wrong treatment have to be addressed.",Malaria journal,EPIDEM

Immune response to persistent pathogens may be one of these mechanisms.    Methods  We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (N=999) composed of adults age 45‚Äì84. Log-binomial regression and ordinal logistic regression models were used to examine associations of socioeconomic factors and psychosocial factors with pathogen burden and immune response among those infected. Pathogen burden was assessed based on seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1, and Chlamydia pneumoniae and antibody levels were used to characterize high immune response to all four pathogens.    Results  Low education was a strong and significant independent predictor of higher pathogen burden after adjustment for covariates (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37, 1.19‚Äì1.57). Among subjects seropositive for all four pathogens, low education and a higher level of chronic psychosocial stress showed a positive association with higher antibody response, although associations were no longer significant in models with all covariates included (OR = 1.64, 95%CI 0.82‚Äì3.31 for lowest vs. highest educational category and OR= 1.29, 95%CI 0.96‚Äì1.73 for a one level increase in chronic stress).

Namani et al. describe a fully integrative and anatomically correct model that accurately predicts experimental observations. Coronary blood flow is regulated to match the oxygen demand of myocytes in the heart wall. Flow regulation is essential to meet the wide range of cardiac workload. The blood flows through a complex coronary vasculature of elastic vessels having nonlinear wall properties, under transmural heterogeneous myocardial extravascular loading. To date, there is no fully integrative flow analysis that incorporates global and local passive and flow control determinants. Here, we provide an integrative model of coronary flow regulation that considers the realistic asymmetric morphology of the coronary network, the dynamic myocardial loading on the vessels embedded in it, and the combined effects of local myogenic effect, local shear regulation, and conducted metabolic control driven by venous O 2 saturation level. The model predicts autoregulation (approximately constant flow over a wide range of coronary perfusion pressures), reduced heterogeneity of regulated flow, and presence of flow reserve, in agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, the model shows that the metabolic and myogenic regulations play a primary role, whereas shear has a secondary one. Regulation was found to have a significant effect on the flow except under extreme (high and low) inlet pressures and metabolic demand. Novel outcomes of the model are that cyclic myocardial loading on coronary vessels enhances the coronary flow reserve except under low inlet perfusion pressure, increases the pressure range of effective autoregulation, and reduces the network flow in the absence of metabolic regulation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of the present biophysical model, which can be used to unravel the underlying mechanisms of coronary physiopathology.",The Journal of general physiology,PHYSIO
0.078131941,18704950,Cell cycle kinases predicted from conserved biophysical properties," Machine learning techniques can classify functionally related proteins where homology-transfer as well as sequence and structure motifs fail. Here, we present a method that aimed at complementing homology-transfer in the identification of cell cycle control kinases from sequence alone. First, we identified functionally significant residues in cell cycle proteins through their high sequence conservation and biophysical properties. We then incorporated these residues and their features into support vector machines (SVM) to identify new kinases and more specifically to differentiate cell cycle kinases from other kinases and other proteins. As expected, the most informative residues tend to be highly conserved and tend to localize in the ATP binding regions of the kinases. Another observation confirmed that ATP binding regions are typically not found on the surface but in partially buried sites, and that this fact is correctly captured by accessibility predictions. By using these highly conserved, semi-buried residues and their biophysical properties we could distinguish cell cycle S/T kinases from other kinase families at levels around 70‚Äì80% accuracy and 61%‚Äì81% coverage. An application to the entire human proteome predicted at least 97 human proteins with limited previous annotations to be candidates for cell cycle kinases. ",Proteins,BIOCHEM

To determine how FA composition is modulated by myosinII activity, we performed proteomic analysis of isolated FAs and compared protein abundance in FAs from cells with and without myosinII inhibition. We identified FA 905 proteins, 459 of which changed in FA abundance with myosinII inhibition, defining the myosinII-responsive FA proteome. FA abundance of 73% of proteins was enhanced by contractility, including those involved in Rho-mediated FA maturation and endocytosis- and calpain-dependent FA disassembly. 27% of proteins, including those involved in Rac-mediated lamellipodial protrusion, were enriched in FA by myosinII inhibition, establishing for the first time negative regulation of FA protein recruitment by contractility. We focused on the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Œ≤-PIX, documenting its role in negative regulation of FA maturation and promotion of lamellipodial protrusion, FA turnover to drive cell migration.",Nature cell biology,BIOCHEM

Using a go/no-go task and in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging, we find that impaired visual discrimination in Fmr1 -/- mice correlates with marked deficits in orientation tuning of principal neurons, and a decrease in the activity of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in primary visual cortex (V1). Restoring visually evoked activity in PV cells in Fmr1 -/- mice with a chemogenetic (DREADD) strategy was sufficient to rescue their behavioral performance. Strikingly, human subjects with FXS exhibit similar impairments in visual discrimination as Fmr1 -/- mice. These results suggest that manipulating inhibition may help sensory processing in FXS.

We collected house dust and indoor air samples in 49 California homes and analyzed for 76 semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs)‚Äîphthalates, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and pesticides. Sixty chemicals were detected in either dust or air and here we report 58 SVOCs detected in dust for the first time. In dust, phthalates (bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, di- n -butyl phthalate) and flame retardants (PBDE 99, PBDE 47) were detected at the highest concentrations relative to other chemicals at the 95th percentile, while phthalates were highest at the median. Because SVOCs are found in both gas and condensed phases and redistribute from their original source over time, partitioning models can clarify their fate indoors. We use empirical data to validate air-dust partitioning models and use these results, combined with experience in SVOC exposure assessment, to recommend residential exposure measurement strategies. We can predict dust concentrations reasonably well from measured air concentrations ( R 2 = 0.80). Partitioning models and knowledge of chemical K oa elucidate exposure pathways and suggest priorities for chemical regulation. These findings also inform study design by allowing researchers to select sampling approaches optimized for their chemicals of interest and study goals. While surface wipes are commonly used in epidemiology studies because of ease of implementation, passive air sampling may be more standardized between homes and also relatively simple to deploy.

Herein, we describe how individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) have their heart rate variability (HRV) and drug-related behaviors negatively affected in response to a stressor. However, we show how cardiorespiratory fitness may attenuate those impairments in autonomic control. Fifteen individuals with SUD were matched with 15 non-SUD individuals by age, weight, height, and fitness level, and had their HRV responses under stress induced by the Cold Pressor Test (CPT). The SUD group had lower mean of R-R intervals before and after the CPT when compared with the non-SUD group. In addition, in individuals with SUD, higher cardiorespiratory fitness level predicted greater vagal activity before, during, and after CPT. Moreover, for individuals with SUD, days of abstinence predicted greater mean of R-R intervals during recovery from the CPT. Finally, years of drug use negatively predicted mean of R-R intervals during recovery. Thus, our results suggest that chronic drug use impairs cardiac autonomic regulation at rest and after a physical stress. However, cardiorespiratory fitness might attenuate these impairments by increasing vagal autonomic activity.",Substance abuse : research and treatment,CLINIC

Previously reported mutations of various V-ATPase subunits are associated with increased bone density. We now show that haploinsufficiency for the H subunit of the V 1 domain (ATP6V1H) is associated with osteoporosis in humans and mice. A genome-wide SNP array analysis of 1625 Han Chinese found that 4 of 15 tag SNPs (26.7%) within ATP6V1H were significantly associated with low spine bone mineral density. Atp6v1h +/- knockout mice generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique had decreased bone remodeling and a net bone matrix loss. Atp6v1h +/- osteoclasts showed impaired bone formation and increased bone resorption. The increased intracellular pH of Atp6v1h +/- osteoclasts downregulated TGF-Œ≤1 activation, thereby reducing induction of osteoblast formation but the bone mineralization was not altered. However, bone formation was reduced more than bone resorption. Our data provide evidence that partial loss of ATP6V1H function results in osteoporosis/osteopenia. We propose that defective osteoclast formation triggers impaired bone formation by altering bone remodeling.

The goal of the current study was to uncover novel extracellular matrix (ECM) components that control the wound healing process. Full thickness skin defects were created in mice and used to show CCN4 up-regulation during wound-healing as early as 1 day after surgery, suggesting a role in inflammation and subsequent dermal migration and proliferation. To determine how CCN4 could regulate wound healing we used Ccn4 -KO mice and showed they had delayed wound closure accompanied by reduced expression of Col1a1 and Fn mRNA. Boyden chamber assays using Ccn4 -deficient dermal fibroblasts showed they have reduced migration and proliferation compared to WT counterparts. To confirm CCN4 has a role in proliferation and migration of dermal cells, siRNA knockdown and transduction of CCN4 adenoviral transduction were used and resulted in reduced or enhanced migration of human adult dermal fibroblast (hADF) cells respectively. The induced migration of the dermal fibroblasts by CCN4 appears to work via Œ±5Œ≤1 integrin receptors that further stimulates down-stream ERK/JNK signaling. The regulation of CCN4 by TNF-Œ± prompted us look further at their potential relationship. Treatment of hADFs with CCN4 and TNF-Œ± alone or together showed CCN4 counteracted the inhibition of TNF-Œ± on COL1A1 and FN mRNA expression and the stimulation of TNF-Œ± on MMP-1 and MMP3 mRNA expression. CCN4 appeared to counterbalance the effects of TNF-Œ± by inhibiting downstream NF-Œ∫B/p-65 signaling. Taken together we show CCN4 stimulates dermal fibroblast cell migration, proliferation and inhibits TNF-Œ± stimulation, all of which could regulate wound healing.

However, demand substantially exceeds supply of suitable organs; consequently many people wait months, or years to receive an organ. Reasons for the chronic shortage of deceased organ donations are unclear; there appears to be no lack of 'in principle' public support for organ donation. Methods/Design The PAraDOx Study examines community preferences for organ donation policy in Australia. The aims are to 1) determine which factors influence decisions by individuals to offer their organs for donation and 2) determine the criteria by which the community deems the allocation of donor organs to be fair and equitable. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to assess community preferences for organ donation and allocation. Focus group participants from the general community, aged between 18-80, will be purposively sampled to ensure a variety of cultural backgrounds and views on organ donation. Each focus group will include a ranking exercise using a modified nominal group technique. Focus groups of organ recipients, their families, and individuals on a transplant waiting list will also be conducted. Using the qualitative work, a discrete choice study will be designed to quantitatively assess community preferences. Discrete choice methods are based on the premise that goods and services can be described in terms of a number of separate attributes. Respondents are presented with a series of choices where levels of attributes are varied, and a mathematical function is estimated to describe numerically the value respondents attach to different options. Two community surveys will be conducted in approximately 1000 respondents each to assess community preferences for organ donation and allocation. A mixed logit model will be used; model results will be expressed as parameter estimates (Œ≤) and the odds of choosing one option over an alternative. Trade-offs between attributes will also be calculated. Discussion By providing a better understanding of current community preferences in relation to organ donation and allocation, the PAraDOx study will highlight options for firstly, increasing the rate of organ donation and secondly, allow for more transparent and equitable policies in relation to organ allocation.",BMC public health,EPIDEM
0.407386282,29227562,Crosstalk Between Substance P and Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide During Heterotopic Ossification in Murine Achilles Tendon," Heterotopic ossification (HO) is abnormal bone formation within soft tissue, usually predisposed by neurogenic or musculoskeletal trauma. Inflammation resulting from trauma is considered to be the main trigger for HO by eliciting changes within the injury site, including elevation of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Recent research, however, has also associated changes in sensory neuropeptide expression with HO. Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are two of those neuropeptides that have been implicated with various aspects of HO, including regulation of inflammation and BMP signaling. Despite discoveries associating SP and CGRP with soft tissue HO, it remains unclear whether SP and CGRP have a direct role in the induction of HO. Here, we investigated the effect of SP and CGRP in vivo with the aid of inkjet-based biopatterning technology to controllably deliver these neuropeptides onto a murine Achilles tendon. While we did not observe any significant effect with CGRP, SP alone promoted HO in vivo with increased expression of BMP2. Remarkably, when SP and CGRP were delivered together, CGRP counteracted the effect of SP and essentially blocked SP-induced HO. This report contributes to the understanding of the complex problem of HO pathophysiology and warrants more study to better elucidate the interplay between SP and CGRP in the induction of HO.

However, ecological data on parasites of important host species is still scanty. We analyze the patterns seen in the faecal parasites of tigers in the Tadoba National Park, India, and speculate on the factors and processes shaping the parasite community and the possible implications for tiger ecology. Results The prevalence and intensities were high and the parasite community was dominated by indirect life cycle parasites. Across all genera of parasites variance scaled with the square of the mean and there was a significant positive correlation between prevalence and abundance. There was no significant association between different types of parasites. Conclusions The 70 samples analyzed formed 14 distinct clusters. If we assume each of the clusters to represent individual tigers that were sampled repeatedly and that resident tigers are more likely to be sampled repeatedly, the presumed transient tigers had significantly greater parasite loads than the presumed resident ones.",BMC ecology,ECO
0.649886479,29460012,Growth Differentiation Factor-6 Attenuated Pro-inflammatory Molecular Changes in the Rabbit Anular-puncture Model and Degenerated Disc-induced Pain Generation in the Rat Xenograft Radiculopathy Model,"  Purpose  To elucidate the effects of growth differentiation factor-6 (GDF6) on: (i) gene expression of inflammatory/pain-related molecules and structural integrity in the rabbit intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration model, and (ii) sensory dysfunction and changes in pain-marker expression in dorsal nerve ganglia (DRGs) in the rat xenograft radiculopathy model.    Methods  Forty-six adolescent rabbits received anular-puncture in two non-consecutive lumbar IVDs. Four weeks later, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or GDF6 (1, 10 or 100 Œºg) was injected into the nucleus pulposus (NP) of punctured discs and followed for four weeks for gene expression analysis and 12 weeks for structural analyses. For pain assessment, eight rabbits were sacrificed at four weeks post-injection and NP tissues of injected discs were transplanted onto L5 DRGs of 16 nude rats to examine mechanical allodynia. The rat DRGs were analyzed immunohistochemically.    Results  In GDF6-treated rabbit NPs, gene expressions of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, vascular endothelial growth factor, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, and nerve growth factor were significantly lower than those in the PBS group. GDF6 injections resulted in partial restoration of disc height and improvement of MRI disc degeneration grades with statistical significance in rabbit structural analyses. Allodynia induced by xenograft transplantation of rabbit degenerated NPs onto rat DRGs was significantly reduced by GDF6 injection. Staining intensities for ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 and calcitonin gene-related peptide in rat DRGs of the GDF6 group were significantly lower than those of the PBS group.    Conclusion  GDF6 injection may change the pathological status of degenerative discs and attenuate degenerated IVD-induced pain.

The Uchl1 -H2BmCherry:GFP-gpi transgene exhibits robust expression and allows clear discrimination of individual cells and cellular processes in cranial ganglia, sympathetic chain, the enteric nervous system (ENS), and autonomic ganglia of the urogenital system. The transgene also labels subsets of cell in endocrine tissues where prior in situ hybridization (ISH) studies have previously identified expression of this deubiquinating enzyme. The Uchl1 -H2BmCherry:GFP-gpi transgene will be a powerful tool for static and live imaging as well as isolation of viable neural progenitors to investigate processes of autonomic neurogenesis.

0.411557723,31263319,"Infrared and Raman spectra of lignin substructures: Coniferyl alcohol, abietin, and coniferyl aldehyde"," Anatomical and chemical information can be linked by Raman imaging. Behind every pixel of the image is a Raman spectrum, which contains all the information as a molecular fingerprint. Yet to understand the spectra, the bands have to be assigned to components and their molecular structures. Although the lignin distribution is easily tracked in plant tissues, the assignment of the spectra is not good enough to allow in-depth analysis of the composition. Assignments of three lignin model compounds were derived from polarization measurements and quantum-chemical computations. Raman spectra of coniferyl alcohol crystals showed orientation dependence, which helped in band assignment. Abietin showed a Raman spectrum that was very similar to the spectrum of coniferyl alcohol, whereas its IR spectrum was very different due to bands of the sugar moiety. The Raman spectrum of coniferyl aldehyde is affected by the crystal order of molecules. All three compounds show much stronger band intensities than unconjugated single aromatic rings, indicating that the bulk of the lignin structure has significantly reduced contribution to Raman band intensities. Therefore, it is possible to highlight certain structures of lignin with Raman spectroscopy, because low amounts of a compound do not necessarily mean weak features in the spectrum.

0.22862168,27571420,Treatment effect of idebenone on inspiratory function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"Summary Assessment of dynamic inspiratory function may provide valuable information about the degree and progression of pulmonary involvement in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The aims of this study were to characterize inspiratory function and to assess the efficacy of idebenone on this pulmonary function outcome in a large and well‚Äêcharacterized cohort of 10‚Äì18 year‚Äêold DMD patients not taking glucocorticoid steroids (GCs) enrolled in the phase 3 randomized controlled DELOS trial. We evaluated the effect of idebenone on the highest flow generated during an inspiratory FVC maneuver (maximum inspiratory flow; V'I,max(FVC)) and the ratio between the largest inspiratory flow during tidal breathing (tidal inspiratory flow; V'I,max(t)) and the V'I,max(FVC). The fraction of the maximum flow that is not used during tidal breathing has been termed inspiratory flow reserve (IFR). DMD patients in both treatment groups of DELOS (idebenone, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ31; placebo: n‚Äâ=‚Äâ33) had comparable and abnormally low V'I,max(FVC) at baseline. During the study period, V'I,max(FVC) further declined by ‚àí0.29‚ÄâL/sec in patients on placebo (95%CI: ‚àí0.51, ‚àí0.08; P =‚Äâ0.008 at week 52), whereas it remained stable in patients on idebenone (change from baseline to week 52: 0.01‚ÄâL/sec; 95%CI: ‚àí0.22, 0.24; P =‚Äâ0.950). The between‚Äêgroup difference favoring idebenone was 0.27‚ÄâL/sec ( P =‚Äâ0.043) at week 26 and 0.30‚ÄâL/sec ( P =‚Äâ0.061) at week 52. In addition, during the study period, IFR improved by 2.8% in patients receiving idebenone and worsened by ‚àí3.0% among patients on placebo (between‚Äêgroup difference 5.8% at week 52; P =‚Äâ0.040). Although the clinical interpretation of these data is currently limited due to the scarcity of routine clinical practice experience with dynamic inspiratory function outcomes in DMD, these findings from a randomized controlled study nevertheless suggest that idebenone preserved inspiratory muscle function as assessed by V'I,max(FVC) and IFR in patients with DMD.

0.44146257,21490722,MDCK Cystogenesis Driven by Cell Stabilization within Computational Analogues,"The study of epithelial morphogenesis is fundamental to increasing our understanding of organ function and disease. Great progress has been made through study of culture systems such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, but many aspects of even simple morphogenesis remain unclear. For example, are specific cell actions tightly coupled to the characteristics of the cell's environment or are they more often cell state dependent? How does the single lumen, single cell layer cyst consistently emerge from a variety of cell actions? To improve insight, we instantiated in silico analogues that used hypothesized cell behavior mechanisms to mimic MDCK cystogenesis. We tested them through in vitro experimentation and quantitative validation. We observed novel growth patterns, including a cell behavior shift that began around day five of growth. We created agent-oriented analogues that used the cellular Potts model along with an Iterative Refinement protocol. Following several refinements, we achieved a degree of validation for two separate mechanisms. Both survived falsification and achieved prespecified measures of similarity to cell culture properties. In silico components and mechanisms mapped to in vitro counterparts. In silico, the axis of cell division significantly affects lumen number without changing cell number or cyst size. Reducing the amount of in silico luminal cell death had limited effect on cystogenesis. Simulations provide an observable theory for cystogenesis based on hypothesized, cell-level operating principles. Author Summary Epithelial cells perform essential functions throughout the body, acting as both barrier and transporter and allowing an organism to survive and thrive in varied environments. Although the details of many processes that occur within individual cells are well understood, we still lack a thorough understanding of how cells coordinate their behaviors to create complex tissues. In order to achieve deeper insight, we created a list of targeted attributes and plausible rules for the growth of multicellular cysts formed by Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells grown in vitro. We then designed in silico analogues of MDCK cystogenesis using object-oriented programming. In silico components (such as the cells and lumens) and their behaviors directly mapped to in vitro components and mechanisms. We conducted in vitro experiments to generate data that would validate or falsify the in silico analogues and then iteratively refined the analogues to mimic that data. Cells in vitro begin to stabilize at around the fifth day even as cysts continue to expand. The in silico system mirrored that behavior and others, achieving new insights. For example, luminal cell death is not strictly required for cystogenesis, and cell division orientation is very important for normal cyst growth.",PLoS computational biology,CS
0.176955144,20360972,Rapid Evolution of Pandemic Noroviruses of the GII.4 Lineage,"Over the last fifteen years there have been five pandemics of norovirus (NoV) associated gastroenteritis, and the period of stasis between each pandemic has been progressively shortening. NoV is classified into five genogroups, which can be further classified into 25 or more different human NoV genotypes; however, only one, genogroup II genotype 4 (GII.4), is associated with pandemics. Hence, GII.4 viruses have both a higher frequency in the host population and greater epidemiological fitness. The aim of this study was to investigate if the accuracy and rate of replication are contributing to the increased epidemiological fitness of the GII.4 strains. The replication and mutation rates were determined using in vitro RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assays, and rates of evolution were determined by bioinformatics. GII.4 strains were compared to the second most reported genotype, recombinant GII.b/GII.3, the rarely detected GII.3 and GII.7 and as a control, hepatitis C virus (HCV). The predominant GII.4 strains had a higher mutation rate and rate of evolution compared to the less frequently detected GII.b, GII.3 and GII.7 strains. Furthermore, the GII.4 lineage had on average a 1.7-fold higher rate of evolution within the capsid sequence and a greater number of non-synonymous changes compared to other NoVs, supporting the theory that it is undergoing antigenic drift at a faster rate. Interestingly, the non-synonymous mutations for all three NoV genotypes were localised to common structural residues in the capsid, indicating that these sites are likely to be under immune selection. This study supports the hypothesis that the ability of the virus to generate genetic diversity is vital for viral fitness. Author Summary Since 1995, norovirus has caused five pandemics of acute gastroenteritis. These pandemics spread across the globe within a few months, causing great economic burden on society due to medical and social expenses. Norovirus, like influenza virus, has over 40 genotypes circulating within the population at the same time. However, it is only a single genotype, known as genogroup II genotype 4 (GII.4), that causes mass outbreaks and pandemics. Very little research has been conducted to determine why GII.4 viruses can cause pandemics. Consequently, we compared the evolution properties of several pandemic GII.4 strains to non-pandemic strains and found that the GII.4 viruses were undergoing evolution at a much higher rate than the non-pandemic norovirus strains. This phenomenon is similar to influenza virus, where an increase in antigenic drift has been associated with increased outbreaks. This discovery has important implications in understanding norovirus incidence and also the development of a vaccine and treatment for norovirus.",PLoS pathogens,IMMUN

0.818134621,30283029,"Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Ranging Trial of Intravenous Ketamine as Adjunctive Therapy in Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)"," Numerous placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the ability of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, to induce rapid (within hours), transient antidepressant effects when administered intravenously (IV) at subanesthetic doses (0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes). However, the optimal antidepressant dose remains unknown. We aimed to compare to active placebo the rapid acting antidepressant properties of a broad range of subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine among outpatients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). A range of IV ketamine doses were compared to active placebo in the treatment of adult TRD over a 3-day period following a single infusion over 40 minutes. This was an outpatient study conducted across six US academic sites. Outpatients 18‚Äì70 years old with TRD, defined as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g., less than 50% improvement of depression symptoms) to at least two adequate treatment courses during the current depressive episode. Following a washout period, 99 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of five arms in a 1:1:1:1:1 fashion: a single intravenous dose of ketamine 0.1 mg/kg (n=18), a single dose of ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (n=20), a single dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (n=22), a single dose of ketamine 1.0 mg/kg (n=20), and a single dose of midazolam 0.045 mg/kg (active placebo) (n=19). The study assessments (HAM-D-6, MADRS. SDQ, PAS, CGI-S and CGI-I) were performed at Days 0, 1, 3 (endpoint), 5, 7, 14, and 30 to assess the safety and efficacy. The overall group*time interaction effect was significant for the primary outcome measure, the HAM-D-6. In post-hoc pairwise comparisons controlling for multiple comparisons standard- (0.5 mg/kg) and high-doses (1 mg/kg) of intravenous ketamine were superior to active placebo; a low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) was significant only prior to adjustment (p=0.02, p-adj=0.14, d=‚àí0.82 at Day 1). Most of the interaction effect was due to differences at Day 1, with no significant adjusted pairwise differences at Day 3. This pattern generally held for secondary outcomes. The infusions of ketamine were relatively well tolerated compared to active placebo, except for greater dissociative symptoms and transient blood pressure elevations with the higher doses. Our results suggest that there is evidence for the efficacy of the 0.5 mg/Kg and 1.0 mg/Kg subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine and no clear or consistent evidence for clinically meaningful efficacy of lower doses of IV ketamine.

0.051408828,29114909,An Ancestry Based Approach for Detecting Interactions,"  Background:  Epistasis and gene-environment interactions are known to contribute significantly to variation of complex phenotypes in model organisms. However, their identification in human association studies remains challenging for myriad reasons. In the case of epistatic interactions, the large number of potential interacting sets of genes presents computational, multiple hypothesis correction, and other statistical power issues. In the case of gene-environment interactions, the lack of consistently measured environmental covariates in most disease studies precludes searching for interactions and creates difficulties for replicating studies.    Results:  In this work, we develop a new statistical approach to address these issues that leverages genetic ancestry, defined as the proportion of ancestry derived from each ancestral population (e.g. the fraction of European/African ancestry in African Americans), in admixed populations. We applied our method to gene expression and methylation data from African American and Latino admixed individuals respectively, identifying nine interactions that were significant at p < 5 √ó 10 ‚àí8 . We show that two of the interactions in methylation data replicate, and the remaining six are significantly enriched for low p-values ( p < 1.8 √ó 10 ‚àí6 ).

While previous studies have audited the hospital AECOPD management of RS, only a small number of studies have evaluated the management of GMP. AIMS: The aims of this study were to firstly examine the differences in AECOPD management of GMP and RS and secondly compare their care to national COPD guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive AECOPD patients admitted to two hospitals (one hospital where all AECOPD patients were managed by RS and another where all AECOPD patients were managed by GMP) over a 3-month period. Electronic medical records, medical case notes, pathology and radiology data for the admission were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 201 COPD exacerbations in 169 patients (49.7% male, mean age 72.3). GMP managed 84 (41.7%) exacerbations. In comparison to RS, GMP performed fewer spirometry tests, blood gas analysis and less frequently treated patients with guideline-recommended medications. Referral to pulmonary rehabilitation was poor for both groups of clinicians. Median length of stay was shorter in GMP patients versus RS patients (3 days vs. 5 days, P = 0.001). There were no differences in the 12-month re-admission (41.7% vs. 38.5%, P = 0.664) and mortality rates (10.7% vs. 6%, P = 0.292) between both groups of patients. CONCLUSION: Our study found differences in the hospital AECOPD management of GMP and RS, but these did not translate into different clinical outcomes between their patients.

However, technological challenges have limited the ability to study heterogeneity of protein expression. This is particularly true for pre-invasive lesions such as ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast. Cell level heterogeneity in ductal carcinoma in situ was analyzed in a single 5um tissue section using a multiplexed immunofluorescence analysis of 11 disease-related markers (EGFR, HER2, HER4, S6, pmTOR, CD44v6, SLC7A5 and CD10, CD4, CD8 and CD20, plus pan-cytokeratin, pan-cadherin, DAPI, Na+K+ATPase for cell segmentation). Expression was quantified at cell level using a single cell segmentation algorithm. K-means clustering was used to determine co-expression patterns of epithelial cell markers and immune markers. We document for the first time the presence of epithelial cell heterogeneity within ducts, between ducts and between patients with ductal carcinoma in situ. There was moderate heterogeneity in a distribution of 8 clusters within each duct (average Shannon Index 0.76; ranged 0 ‚Äì 1.61). Furthermore, within each patient, the average Shannon Index across all ducts ranged from 0.33 to 1.02 (S.D. 0.09 to 0.38). As the distribution of clusters within ducts was uneven, the analysis of 8 ducts might be sufficient to represent all the clusters i.e. within- and between-duct heterogeneity. The pattern of epithelial cell clustering was associated with the presence and type of immune infiltrates, indicating a complex interaction between the epithelial tumor and immune system for each patient. This analysis also provides the first evidence that simultaneous analysis of both the epithelial and immune/stromal components might be necessary to understand the complex milieu in ductal carcinoma in situ lesions.","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",ONCO

0.330725363,22353712,Unique domain appended to vertebrate tRNA synthetase is essential for vascular development,"New domains were progressively added to cytoplasmic aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases during evolution. One example is the UNE-S domain, appended to seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) in species that developed closed circulatory systems. Here we show using solution and crystal structure analyses and in vitro and in vivo functional studies that UNE-S harbours a robust nuclear localization signal (NLS) directing SerRS to the nucleus where it attenuates vascular endothelial growth factor A expression. We also show that SerRS mutants previously linked to vasculature abnormalities either deleted the NLS or have the NLS sequestered in an alternative conformation. A structure-based second-site mutation, designed to release the sequestered NLS, restored normal vasculature. Thus, the essential function of SerRS in vascular development depends on UNE-S. These results are the first to show an essential role for a tRNA synthetase-associated appended domain at the organism level, and suggest that acquisition of UNE-S has a role in the establishment of the closed circulatory systems of vertebrates. Seryl-tRNA synthetase is important in vasculogenesis and contains a unique domain at its C-terminus.

0.064853618,26152585,NS5A Domain 1 and Polyprotein Cleavage Kinetics Are Critical for Induction of Double-Membrane Vesicles Associated with Hepatitis C Virus Replication,"ABSTRACT Induction of membrane rearrangements in the cytoplasm of infected cells is a hallmark of positive-strand RNA viruses. These altered membranes serve as scaffolds for the assembly of viral replication factories (RFs). We have recently shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces endoplasmic reticulum-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) representing the major constituent of the RF within the infected cell. RF formation requires the concerted action of nonstructural action of nonstructural protein (NS)3, -4A, protein (NS)3 -4A, -4B, -5A, and -5B. Although the sole expression of NS5A is sufficient to induce DMV formation, its efficiency is very low. In this study, we dissected the determinants within NS5A responsible for DMV formation and found that RNA-binding domain 1 (D1) and the amino-terminal membrane anchor are indispensable for this process. In contrast, deletion of NS5A D2 or D3 did not affect DMV formation but disrupted RNA replication and virus assembly, respectively. To identify cis - and trans -acting factors of DMV formation, we established a trans cleavage assay. We found that induction of DMVs requires full-length NS3, whereas a helicase-lacking mutant was unable to trigger DMV formation in spite of efficient polyprotein cleavage. Importantly, a mutation accelerating cleavage kinetics at the NS4B-5A site diminished DMV formation, while the insertion of an internal ribosome entry site mimicking constitutive cleavage at this boundary completely abolished this process. These results identify key determinants governing the biogenesis of the HCV RF with possible implications for our understanding of how RFs are formed in other positive-strand RNA viruses. IMPORTANCE Like all positive-strand RNA viruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV) extensively reorganizes intracellular membranes to allow efficient RNA replication. Double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that putatively represent sites of HCV RNA amplification are induced by the concerted action of viral and cellular factors. However, the contribution of individual proteins to this process remains poorly understood. Here we identify determinants in the HCV replicase that are required for DMV biogenesis. Major contributors to this process are domain 1 of nonstructural protein 5A and the helicase domain of nonstructural protein 3. In addition, efficient DMV induction depends on cis cleavage of the viral polyprotein, as well as tightly regulated cleavage kinetics. These results identify key determinants governing the biogenesis of the HCV replication factory with possible implications for our understanding of how this central compartment is formed in other positive-strand RNA viruses.",mBio,BIOCHEM

Materials and Methods: A finite element model was made and elastic moduli and poissons ratio of all the materials fed to the software. For both the models, a 100N force was applied on the lingual surface of the tooth at an angle of 45¬∞. Stress concentration and distribution were evaluated and noted down for both the posts. Results: Finite element method revealed that Glass fibre post had homogenous distribution of stress whereas in zirconia post the stress was concentrated in the post. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that glass fibre post should be used in well-conserved radicular tooth structure and Zirconia post is indicated in weakened and grossly destructed tooth structure.",European journal of dentistry,CLINIC
0.779789744,31187096,Online Decentralized Leverage Score Sampling for Streaming Multidimensional Time Series," Estimating the dependence structure of multidimensional time series data in real-time is challenging. With large volumes of streaming data, the problem becomes more difficult when the multidimensional data are collected asynchronously across distributed nodes, which motivates us to sample representative data points from streams. We propose a leverage score sampling (LSS) method for efficient online inference of the streaming vector autoregressive (VAR) model. We define the leverage score for the streaming VAR model so that the LSS method selects informative data points in real-time with statistical guarantees of parameter estimation efficiency. Moreover, our LSS method can be directly deployed in an asynchronous decentralized environment, e.g., a sensor network without a fusion center, and produce asynchronous consensus online parameter estimation over time. By exploiting the temporal dependence structure of the VAR model, the LSS method selects samples independently on each dimension and thus is able to update the estimation asynchronously. We illustrate the effectiveness of the LSS method in synthetic, gas sensor and seismic datasets. ",Proceedings of machine learning research,CS
0.057794546,29228195,Structural connectivity of right frontal hyperactive areas scales with stuttering severity,"Persistent stuttering reflects atypical brain activity and connectivity, most notably within the left hemisphere speech production networks. Neef et al. link right frontal overactivations common to stuttering to structural networks that support right hemisphere specialisations. In particular, severe stuttering reflects increased activity in a global motor response inhibition network. Abstract A neuronal sign of persistent developmental stuttering is the magnified coactivation of right frontal brain regions during speech production. Whether and how stuttering severity relates to the connection strength of these hyperactive right frontal areas to other brain areas is an open question. Scrutinizing such brain‚Äìbehaviour and structure‚Äìfunction relationships aims at disentangling suspected underlying neuronal mechanisms of stuttering. Here, we acquired diffusion-weighted and functional images from 31 adults who stutter and 34 matched control participants. Using a newly developed structural connectivity measure, we calculated voxel-wise correlations between connection strength and stuttering severity within tract volumes that originated from functionally hyperactive right frontal regions. Correlation analyses revealed that with increasing speech motor deficits the connection strength increased in the right frontal aslant tract, the right anterior thalamic radiation, and in U-shaped projections underneath the right precentral sulcus. In contrast, with decreasing speech motor deficits connection strength increased in the right uncinate fasciculus. Additional group comparisons of whole-brain white matter skeletons replicated the previously reported reduction of fractional anisotropy in the left and right superior longitudinal fasciculus as well as at the junction of right frontal aslant tract and right superior longitudinal fasciculus in adults who stutter compared to control participants. Overall, our investigation suggests that right fronto-temporal networks play a compensatory role as a fluency enhancing mechanism. In contrast, the increased connection strength within subcortical-cortical pathways may be implied in an overly active global response suppression mechanism in stuttering. Altogether, this combined functional MRI‚Äìdiffusion tensor imaging study disentangles different networks involved in the neuronal underpinnings of the speech motor deficit in persistent developmental stuttering.",Brain : a journal of neurology,NEURO

The scolopendrasin VII-induced chemotactic migration of macrophages is inhibited by the formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) antagonist cyclosporine H. We also found that scolopendrasin VII stimulate the chemotactic migration of FPR1-transfected RBL-2H3 cells, but not that of vector-transfected cells; moreover, scolopendrasin VII directly binds to FPR1. Our findings therefore suggest that the antimicrobial peptide scolopendrasin VII, derived from Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans , stimulates macrophages, resulting in chemotactic migration via FPR1 signaling, and the peptide can be useful in the study of FPR1-related biological responses.

The objective of this study was to analyze the change in the health of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part A (hospital insurance) between 2008 and 2010 by comparing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions. Methods We conducted descriptive analyses using the 2008 and 2010 Chronic Conditions Public Use Files, which are newly available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and have administrative (claims) data on 100% of the Medicare fee-for-service population. We examined the data by age, sex, and dual eligibility (eligibility for both Medicare and Medicaid). Results Medicare Part A beneficiaries had more chronic conditions on average in 2010 than in 2008. The percentage increase in the average number of chronic conditions was larger for dual-eligible beneficiaries (2.8%) than for nondual-eligible beneficiaries (1.2%). The prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased. The deterioration of average health was due to other chronic conditions: chronic kidney disease, depression, diabetes, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis. Trends in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed differences by sex or dual eligibility or both. Conclusion Analyzing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions by using Medicare claims data provides a monitoring tool that can guide health care providers and policy makers in devising strategies to address chronic conditions and rising health care costs.",Preventing chronic disease,EPIDEM

Despite the transient episodes of clinical symptoms, brain alterations are still observed in patients with TIA. However, the functional mechanism of transient ischemia is still unclear. Here, we employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to explore the functional abnormalities in patients with TIA. Methods: 48 TIA patients and 41 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in the study. For each participant, we collected rs-fMRI data and clinical/physiological/biochemical data. Amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and degree centrality (DC) were then calculated. Two sample t -tests were performed to compare the ALFF, ReHo, and DC maps between the two groups. Furthermore, a correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between local brain abnormalities and clinical/physiological/biochemical characteristics tests in TIA patients. Results: Compared with the HCs, the TIA patients exhibited decreased ALFF in the left middle temporal gyrus, decreased DC in the triangular part of right inferior frontal gyrus, and no significant statistical difference in ReHo. No correlation was found between local abnormalities and clinical/physiological/biochemical scores in the patients with TIA. Conclusion: Collectively, we found decreased ALFF and DC in patients with TIA which provide evidence for local brain dysfunctions and may help to understand the pathological mechanism for the disease.",Frontiers in neuroscience,NEURO

Sleep complaints are common among patients with epilepsy. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of subjective sleep disturbances and its effects on sleep quality in epileptic patients. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 152 consecutive epileptic patients and 152 controls were interviewed. We used Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Berlin Questionnaire and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index to measure excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea and sleep quality. R estless leg syndrome was diagnosed using three questions. Results The age, gender and average total sleep time was similar in patients and control group. The frequency of excessive sleepiness scale and subjective complaint of sleep maintenance was higher in epileptic patients than control group (P<0.05). The symptoms of restless leg syndrome were reported by 32.3% of patients and 11.8% of controls (P<0.05).

0.484046701,31186331,Extensive Epitranscriptomic Methylation of A and C Residues on Murine Leukemia Virus Transcripts Enhances Viral Gene Expression,"The data presented in the present study demonstrate that MLV RNAs bear an exceptionally high level of the epitranscriptomic modifications m 6 A, m 5 C, and Nm, suggesting that these each facilitate some aspect of the viral replication cycle. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that mutational removal of a subset of these m 6 A or m 5 C modifications from MLV transcripts inhibits MLV replication in cis , and a similar result was also observed upon manipulation of the level of expression of key cellular epitranscriptomic cofactors in trans . Together, these results argue that the addition of several different epitranscriptomic modifications to viral transcripts stimulates viral gene expression and suggest that MLV has therefore evolved to maximize the level of these modifications that are added to viral RNAs. ABSTRACT While it has been known for several years that viral RNAs are subject to the addition of several distinct covalent modifications to individual nucleotides, collectively referred to as epitranscriptomic modifications, the effect of these editing events on viral gene expression has been controversial. Here, we report the purification of murine leukemia virus (MLV) genomic RNA to homogeneity and show that this viral RNA contains levels of N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A), 5-methylcytosine (m 5 C), and 2‚Ä≤O-methylated (Nm) ribonucleotides that are an order of magnitude higher than detected on bulk cellular mRNAs. Mapping of m 6 A and m 5 C residues on MLV transcripts identified multiple discrete editing sites and allowed the construction of MLV variants bearing silent mutations that removed a subset of these sites. Analysis of the replication potential of these mutants revealed a modest but significant attenuation in viral replication in 3T3 cells in culture. Consistent with a positive role for m 6 A and m 5 C in viral replication, we also demonstrate that overexpression of the key m 6 A reader protein YTHDF2 enhances MLV replication, while downregulation of the m 5 C writer NSUN2 inhibits MLV replication.",mBio,IMMUN

The purification of the Synecho-cystis 6xHis-ATPase by single-step Ni-affinity chromatography under native and denaturating conditions is described. ATPase activity and the formation of phosphointermediates verify the full function of the enzyme: the ATPase is inhibited by vanadate (IC 50 = 119 ŒºM) and the formation of phosphorylated enzyme intermediates shown by acidic PAGE depends on calcium, indicating that the Synechocystis P-ATPase functions as a calcium pump.",Biological procedures online,BIOCHEM
0.286975069,28872689,"Metabolic interactions between acetaminophen (paracetamol) and two flavonoids, luteolin and quercetin, through  in vitro  inhibition studies","  Objectives  Excessive exposure to acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol) can cause liver injury through formation of a reactive metabolite that depletes hepatic glutathione and causes hepatocellular oxidative stress and damage. Generation of this metabolite is mediated by Cytochrome-P450 (CYP) isoforms, mainly CYP2E1. A number of naturally-occurring flavonoids can mitigate APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in experimental animal models. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of these protective effects, and to evaluate possible human applicability.    Methods  Two flavonoids, luteolin and quercetin, were evaluated as potential inhibitors of eight human CYP isoforms, of six UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms, and of APAP glucuronidation and sulfation. The experimental model was based on in vitro metabolism by human liver microsomes, using isoform-specific substrates.    Key findings  Luteolin and quercetin inhibited human CYP isoforms to varying degrees, with greatest potency toward CYP1A2 and 2C8. However 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 values) were generally in the micromolar range. UGT isoforms were minimally inhibited. Both luteolin and quercetin inhibited APAP sulfation but not glucuronidation.    Conclusions  Inhibition of human CYP activity by luteolin and quercetin occurred with IC 50 values exceeding customary in vivo human exposure with tolerable supplemental doses of these compounds. The findings indicate that luteolin and quercetin are not likely to be of clinical value for preventing or treating APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.  ",The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,BIOCHEM
0.702133781,20855059,"The Impact of Occlusal Function on Structural Adaptation in Alveolar Bone of the Growing Pig,  Sus Scrofa","  Objectives  This study investigated the effects of growth and tooth loading on the structural adaptation of the developing alveolar bone adjacent to the tooth root as the tooth erupted into function. Growth and occlusal function were expected to lead to increased alveolar bone density. Meanwhile, the supporting alveolar bone was expected to develop a dominant trabecular orientation (anisotropy) only after occlusal loading.    Design  Minipigs with erupting and occluding mandibular first molars (M 1 ‚Äôs) were used to study the effects of growth and occlusal function on developing alveolar bone structure through comparison of alveolar bone surrounding M 1 ‚Äôs. A second minipig model with one side upper opponent teeth extracted prior to occlusal contact with the M 1 was raised until the non-extraction side M 1 ‚Äôs developed full occlusal contact. The comparisons between extraction and non-extraction side M 1 alveolar bone were used to emphasize the impact of occlusal loading on alveolar bone structure. Specimens were scanned on a Scanco Medical ŒºCT 20 at a 22Œºm voxel resolution for structural analysis.    Results  With growth and occlusal function a distinct alveolar bone proper tended to develop immediately adjacent to the tooth root. The cancellous bone had thicker but fewer and more separated trabeculae after growth or occlusal loading. On the other hand, occlusal function did not lead to increased alveolar structural anisotropy.    Conclusion  During tooth eruption, growth and masticatory loads effect structural change in alveolar bone. The impact of occlusal function on cancellous bone anisotropy may need a more extensive period of time to demonstrate.  ",Archives of oral biology,ANIMAL
0.21300366,16135228,VSG switching in  Trypanosoma brucei:  antigenic variation analysed using RNAi in the absence of immune selection," Summary  Trypanosoma brucei relies on antigenic variation of its Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat for survival. We show that VSG switching can be efficiently studied in vitro using VSG RNAi in place of an immune system to select for switch variants. Contrary to models predicting an instant switch after inhibition of VSG synthesis, switching was not induced by VSG RNAi and occurred at a rate of 10 ‚àí4 per division. We find a highly reproducible hierarchy of VSG activation which appears to be capable of resetting, whereby more than half of the switch events over 12 experiments were to one of two VSGs. We characterised switched clones according to switch mechanism using marker genes in the active VSG expression site (ES). Transcriptional switches between ESs were the preferred switching mechanism, whereby at least 10 of the 17 ESs identified in T. brucei 427 can be functionally active in vitro . We could specifically select for switches mediated by DNA rearrangements by inducing VSG RNAi in the presence of drug selection for the active ES. Most of the preferentially activated VSG s could be activated by multiple mechanisms. This VSG RNAi based procedure provides a rapid and powerful means for analysing VSG switching in African trypanosomes entirely in vitro . ",Molecular microbiology,BIOCHEM
0.024896559,21257162,Distress Tolerance Moderates the Relationship between Negative Affect Intensity with Borderline Personality Disorder Levels," A number of studies have suggested that negative emotionality and negative affect intensity play key roles in the development and maintenance of borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, more recent research indicates that one‚Äôs response to affective discomfort may be an even more important variable in the pathogenesis of BPD than either negative emotionality or negative affect intensity per se. As such, the current study aimed to empirically test the moderating role of two well-validated laboratory measures of the ability to tolerate psychological distress (distress tolerance) in the relationship of negative emotionality and negative affect intensity with BPD levels a sample of 186 adult men and women drawn from the community and from an urban substance use center. Results provide laboratory-based evidence for a moderating effect of distress tolerance on the relationship of negative emotionality and negative affect intensity with levels of BPD. Specifically, the two former variables were related to levels of BPD among those with low distress tolerance. The current results add support to existing developmental frameworks of BPD, and suggest the importance of modifying one‚Äôs response to affective distress along with levels of negative emotionality in treatment settings.

We evaluated the accuracy of Immuno-Mycologics (IMMY, Norman, OK) CrAg lateral flow assay (LFA) using different techniques at point of care.    Setting  Two tertiary-level hospitals in Johannesburg and a community health clinic in Soweto, South Africa.    Methods  A case-control diagnostic validation study, and a prospective clinic-based implementation study using the IMMY CrAg LFA on finger-prick blood. Accuracy, using direct application of LFA to sample, or pipette to transfer sample to diluent, and reading after 10 and 20 minutes, was compared to laboratory-based plasma testing.    Results  The validation study tested 64 CrAg-positive and 152 CrAg-negative patients with no symptoms or signs of meningitis, identified by routine laboratory screening, recruited by convenience sampling. Consecutively-diagnosed HIV-infected adults (n=654) were included in the implementation study. Sensitivity was 82% and 20% when the LFA was read 10 minutes after direct application to finger-prick blood in the validation and implementation studies respectively. Using a pipette to transfer blood and reading after 20 minutes improved sensitivity to 100%, while retaining 100% specificity, in both studies.    Conclusions  Although the IMMY CrAg LFA performs well when applied directly to finger-prick blood for diagnosing cryptococcal meningitis, this technique may not provide adequate volume to detect low concentrations of CrAg when screening asymptomatic patients. Using a pipette to transfer larger volumes of blood to diluent prior to CrAg LFA testing and reading results after 20 minutes is a more reliable point-of-care method.

0.957005413,25448348,In vivo performance of novel soybean/gelatin-based bioactive and injectable hydroxyapatite foams,"Graphical abstract Major limitations of calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) are their relatively slow degradation rate and the lack of macropores allowing the ingrowth of bone tissue. The development of self-setting cement foams has been proposed as a suitable strategy to overcome these limitations. In previous work we developed a gelatine-based hydroxyapatite foam (G-foam), which exhibited good injectability and cohesion, interconnected porosity and good biocompatibility in vitro. In the present study we evaluated the in vivo performance of the G-foam. Furthermore, we investigated whether enrichment of the foam with soybean extract (SG-foam) increased its bioactivity. G-foam, SG-foam and non-foamed CPC were implanted in a critical-size bone defect in the distal femoral condyle of New Zealand white rabbits. Bone formation and degradation of the materials were investigated after 4, 12 and 20¬†weeks using histological and biomechanical methods. The foams maintained their macroporosity after injection and setting in vivo. Compared to non-foamed CPC, cellular degradation of the foams was considerably increased and accompanied by new bone formation. The additional functionalization with soybean extract in the SG-foam slightly reduced the degradation rate and positively influenced bone formation in the defect. Furthermore, both foams exhibited excellent biocompatibility, implying that these novel materials may be promising for clinical application in non-loaded bone defects.",Acta biomaterialia,BIOCHEM
0.640317578,19961940,Competition between learned reward and error outcome predictions in anterior cingulate cortex," The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is implicated in performance monitoring and cognitive control. Non-human primate studies of ACC show prominent reward signals, but these are elusive in human studies, which instead show mainly conflict and error effects. Here we demonstrate distinct appetitive and aversive activity in human ACC. The error likelihood hypothesis suggests that ACC activity increases in proportion to the likelihood of an error, and ACC is also sensitive to the consequence magnitude of the predicted error. Previous work further showed that error likelihood effects reach a ceiling as the potential consequences of an error increase, possibly due to reductions in the average reward. We explored this issue by independently manipulating reward magnitude of task responses and error likelihood while controlling for potential error consequences in an incentive change signal task. The fMRI results ruled out a modulatory effect of expected reward on error likelihood effects in favor of a competition effect between expected reward and error likelihood. Dynamic causal modeling showed that error likelihood and expected reward signals are intrinsic to the ACC rather than received from elsewhere. These findings agree with interpretations of ACC activity as signaling both perceptions of risk and predicted reward. ",NeuroImage,NEURO

Methods This was a secondary analysis of the CAROTID trial ( NCT00981383 ). Composite immediate recall, measured using the California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition, and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised, was assessed. LPH, 4-HNE, 8-ISO, MDA, and n-3 PUFA concentrations were analysed from fasting blood. Patients then received either n-3 PUFA treatment or placebo for 12 weeks, after which composite immediate recall was reassessed. Linear regression was used to investigate relationships between lipid peroxidation markers and changes in composite immediate recall in each treatment group. Results Eighty-five patients (age = 61.1 ¬± 8.5, 77% male, mean years of education = 15.3 ¬± 3.4) were included ( n = 46 placebo, n = 39 n-3 PUFA). After adjusting for multiple comparisons and potential confounders, greater baseline concentrations of LPH ( Œ≤ = 0.45, p = .002) and 4-HNE ( Œ≤ = 0.38, p = .005) were associated with greater improvement in composite immediate recall among n-3 PUFA-treated patients.

0.328928666,29878001,Nanoscale Partitioning of Paclitaxel in Hybrid Lipid-Polymer Membranes," Paclitaxel is a powerful drug against restenosis and many forms of cancer. However, its clinical application hinges on the ability to achieve suitable stabilized drug concentrations in an aqueous suspension while hindering drug crystallization. To engineer such formulations, it is imperative to understand paclitaxel‚Äôs partitioning and crystallization within the carrier matrix. Lipid-polymer hybrid films have been recently shown to accommodate large paclitaxel loads and suppress crystallization. Additionally, such hybrid materials promote synergistic drug release compared to the pure constituents. Here, we leverage the composition sensitive photo-thermal induced resonance (PTIR) technique to study paclitaxel partitioning within hybrid films at the nanoscale. PTIR data reveal that paclitaxel nano-crystals segregate from lipid-only films but are well dispersed in polymer-only films. Remarkably, lipid-polymer hybrid films show enhanced partitioning of paclitaxel at the lipid-polymer phase boundaries, but still stifle crystallization, thus paving the way towards compositional and microstructural engineering of small-drug delivery systems.

0.443250256,19409266,Uncoupling Dendrite Growth and Patterning: Single Cell Knockout Analysis of NMDA Receptor 2B," SUMMARY  N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play important functions in neural development. NR2B is the predominant NR2 subunit of NMDAR in the developing brain. Here we use MADM (Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers) to knock out NR2B in isolated single cells and analyze its cell-autonomous function in dendrite development. NR2B mutant dentate gyrus granule cells (dGCs) and barrel cortex layer 4 spiny stellate cells (bSCs) have similar dendritic growth rates, total length and branch number as control cells. However, mutant dGCs maintain supernumerary primary dendrites resulting from a pruning defect. Furthermore, while control bSCs restrict dendritic growth to a single barrel, mutant bSCs maintain dendritic growth in multiple barrels. Thus, NR2B functions cell-autonomously to regulate dendrite patterning to ensure that sensory information is properly represented in the cortex. Our study also indicates that molecular mechanisms that regulate activity-dependent dendrite patterning can be separated from those that control general dendrite growth and branching. ",Neuron,NEURO

In this study, we performed detailed analysis of DNA‚ÄìSWCNT aggregate formation, structure, and composition in the context of endothelial cell condition media. Interestingly, we found that aggregates formed within condition media from cells that have undergone a stress response differ in size and organization from that of the control. We also found that temperature increases also promote DNA‚ÄìSWCNT associations. A mathematical model was developed to describe the kinetics of SWCNT extraction from solution. Through orthogonal optical analysis and imaging modalities, we verified that proteins form the bulk of the aggregate structure and dictate aggregate assembly at multiple levels of organization. Finally, physiochemical analysis indicated preferential extraction of low-abundance hydrophobic and charged proteins.

Significant work has examined a range of bacterial communities, but the distribution of microbial eukaryotes is less well characterized. Humans have an ancient association with grape vines ( V itis vinifera ) and have been making wine since the dawn of civilization, and fungi drive this natural process. While the molecular biology of certain fungi naturally associated with vines and wines is well characterized, complementary investigations into the ecology of fungi associated with fruiting plants is largely lacking. DNA sequencing technologies allow the direct estimation of microbial diversity from a given sample, avoiding culture-based biases. Here, we use deep community pyrosequencing approaches, targeted at the 26S rRNA gene, to examine the richness and composition of fungal communities associated with grapevines and test for geographical community structure among four major regions in New Zealand (NZ).

0.233826477,26614803,Effect of calcium/sodium ion exchange on the osmotic properties and structure of polyelectrolyte gels," We discuss the main findings of a long-term research program exploring the consequences of sodium/calcium ion exchange on the macroscopic osmotic and elastic properties, and the microscopic structure of representative synthetic polyelectrolyte (sodium polyacrylate, (polyacrylic acid)) and biopolymer gels (DNA). A common feature of these gels is that above a threshold calcium ion concentration, they exhibit a reversible volume phase transition. At the macroscopic level, the concentration dependence of the osmotic pressure shows that calcium ions influence primarily the third-order interaction term in the Flory‚ÄìHuggins model of polymer solutions. Mechanical tests reveal that the elastic modulus is practically unaffected by the presence of calcium ions, indicating that ion bridging does not create permanent cross-links. At the microscopic level, small-angle neutron scattering shows that polyacrylic acid and DNA gels exhibit qualitatively similar structural features in spite of important differences (e.g. chain flexibility and chemical composition) between the two polymers. The main effect of calcium ions is that the neutron scattering intensity increases due to the decrease in the osmotic modulus. At the level of the counterion cloud around dissolved macroions, anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering measurements made on DNA indicate that divalent ions form a cylindrical sheath enveloping the chain, but they are not localized. Small-angle neutron scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering provide complementary information on the structure and interactions in polymer solutions and gels.

We estimated spontaneous rates of insertion and deletion for all known, active TE superfamilies present in a set of Drosophila melanogaster mutation-accumulation (MA) lines using whole genome sequence data. Our results demonstrate that TE insertions far outpace TE deletions in D. melanogaster . We found a significant effect of background genotype on TE activity, with higher rates of insertions in one MA line. We also found significant rate heterogeneity between the chromosomes, with both insertion and deletion rates elevated on the X relative to the autosomes. Further, we identified significant associations between TE activity and chromatin state, and tested for associations between TE activity and other features of the local genomic environment such as TE content, exon content, GC content, and recombination rate. Our results provide the most detailed assessment of TE mobility in any organism to date, and provide a useful benchmark for both addressing theoretical predictions of TE dynamics and for exploring large-scale patterns of TE movement in D. melanogaster and other species.",Genome biology and evolution,ECO
0.996252969,30766787,Pharmacometabolomic prediction of individual differences of gastrointestinal toxicity complicating myelosuppression in rats induced by irinotecan,"Pharmacometabolomics has been already successfully used in toxicity prediction for one specific adverse effect. However in clinical practice, two or more different toxicities are always accompanied with each other, which puts forward new challenges for pharmacometabolomics. Gastrointestinal toxicity and myelosuppression are two major adverse effects induced by Irinotecan (CPT-11), and often show large individual differences. In the current study, a pharmacometabolomic study was performed to screen the exclusive biomarkers in predose serums which could predict late-onset diarrhea and myelosuppression of CPT-11 simultaneously. The severity and sensitivity differences in gastrointestinal toxicity and myelosuppression were judged by delayed-onset diarrhea symptoms, histopathology examination, relative cytokines and blood cell counts. Mass spectrometry-based non-targeted and targeted metabolomics were conducted in sequence to dissect metabolite signatures in predose serums. Eventually, two groups of metabolites were screened out as predictors for individual differences in late-onset diarrhea and myelosuppression using binary logistic regression, respectively. This result was compared with existing predictors and validated by another independent external validation set. Our study indicates the prediction of toxicity could be possible upon predose metabolic profile. Pharmacometabolomics can be a potentially useful tool for complicating toxicity prediction. Our findings also provide a new insight into CPT-11 precision medicine. Graphical abstract Mass spectrometry-based non-targeted and targeted metabolomics were conducted in sequence to screen the exclusive biomarkers in predose serums. Based on the pharmacometabolomic analysis, two prediction models were constructed to predict gastrointestinal toxicity and myelosuppression of CPT-11 simultaneously, followed by verification of relevant chemotherapeutic toxicity evaluation indexes. fx1",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

The aim of this study was to analyse the mediating role of perceived stress in the effect that self-efficacy has on engagement in nurses. The sample was comprised of 1777 currently working nurses. We administered the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), the Perceived Stress Questionnaire and the General Self-Efficacy Scale. Following bivariate correlational analysis, multiple linear regression analysis and simple and multiple mediation analysis, the results showed self-efficacy to be a powerful personal resource that positively predicts employee engagement, although the effect diminishes when there are mediating variables of stress. We found differences in the way the different aspects of stress mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and the engagement dimensions. ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äìjoy‚Äù was the strongest mediating variable for all of the engagement dimensions and this, together with ‚Äúharassment‚Äìsocial acceptance‚Äù dampened the effect of self-efficacy on vigour and dedication, whereas ‚ÄúOverload‚Äù was only a mediator for dedication. As nurses work in a stressful environment, risk factors arise from work activity, so hospital management should design interventions to enhance their workers‚Äô personal resources and improve personal and organizational wellbeing.",Journal of clinical medicine,PSYCH
0.354231045,30819546,The Mechanosensitive Ion Channel Piezo Inhibits Axon Regeneration," SUMMARY  Neurons exhibit a limited ability of repair. Given that mechanical forces affect neuronal outgrowth, it is important to investigate whether mechanosensitive ion channels may regulate axon regeneration. Here, we show that DmPiezo, a Ca 2+ -permeable non-selective cation channel, functions as an intrinsic inhibitor for axon regeneration in Drosophila . DmPiezo activation during axon regeneration induces local Ca 2+ transients at the growth cone, leading to activation of nitric oxide synthase and the downstream cGMP kinase Foraging or PKG to restrict axon re-growth. Loss of DmPiezo enhances axon regeneration of sensory neurons in the peripheral and CNS. Conditional knockout of its mammalian homolog Piezo1 in vivo accelerates regeneration, while its pharmacological activation in vitro modestly reduces regeneration, suggesting the role of Piezo in inhibiting regeneration may be evolutionarily conserved. These findings provide a precedent for the involvement of mechanosensitive channels in axon regeneration and add a potential target for modulating nervous system repair.   In Brief  Piezo is a mechanosensitive ion channel that transduces mechanical stimuli into cellular responses. Here, Song et al. show that Piezo is recruited after axon injury to inhibit axon regeneration via the CamKIINos-PKG pathway, a process that may be evolutionarily conserved. ",Neuron,NEURO

Methods We analyzed a set of secondary data regarding 716 individuals extracted from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2008 to 2010. The statistical package of SPSS and MATLAB were used for data analysis and development of the prediction model. The algorithms used in the study were the following: stepwise logistic regression (SLR) analysis and machine learning (ML) techniques, such as decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine methods. Results Five factors with statistical significance were identified for HRQoL in the elderly with chronic diseases: 'monthly income', 'diagnosis of chronic disease', 'depression', 'discomfort', and 'perceived health status.' The SLR analysis showed the best performance with accuracy = 0.93 and F-score = 0.49. The results of this study provide essential materials that will help formulate personalized health management strategies and develop interventions programs towards the improvement of the HRQoL for elderly people with chronic diseases. Conclusions Our study is, to our best knowledge, the first attempt to identify the influencing factors and to apply prediction models for the HRQoL of the elderly with chronic diseases by using ML techniques as an alternative and complement to the traditional statistical approaches.",Healthcare informatics research,CS
0.324696378,22973864,Nanoparticle targeting to neurons in a rat hippocampal slice culture model,"We have previously shown that CdSe/ZnS core/shell luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals or QDs (quantum dots) coated with PEG [poly(ethylene glycol)]-appended DHLA (dihydrolipoic acid) can bind AcWG(Pal)VKIKKP 9 GGH 6 (Palm1) through the histidine residues. The coating on the QD provides colloidal stability and this peptide complex uniquely allows the QDs to be taken up by cultured cells and readily exit the endosome into the soma. We now show that use of a polyampholyte coating [in which the neutral PEG is replaced by the negatively heterocharged CL4 (compact ligand)], results in the specific targeting of the palmitoylated peptide to neurons in mature rat hippocampal slice cultures. There was no noticeable uptake by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or microglia (identified by immunocytochemistry), demonstrating neuronal specificity to the overall negatively charged CL4 coating. In addition, EM (electron microscopy) images confirm the endosomal egress ability of the Palm1 peptide by showing a much more disperse cytosolic distribution of the CL4 QDs conjugated to Palm1 compared with CL4 QDs alone. This suggests a novel and robust way of delivering neurotherapeutics to neurons.",ASN neuro,NEURO

In some cases their presence is beneficial to the host due to the synthesis of bioactive compounds, among which several alcohols, esters, ketones and others that may react with other compounds and may be lethal to pathogenic microorganisms. Diaporthe helianthi ( Phomopsis helianthi in its anamorphic phase) is available worldwide, especially in Europe, Asia and America. Isolated in Europe as an agent of the sunflower stem cancer, it has also been endophytically isolated from tropical and temperate plants. A D. helianthi strain isolated from Luehea divaricata has been employed in current research. An investigation of the secondary metabolite from D. helianthi by CC and NMR of 1 H and 13 C yielded the separation of 10 fractions and the identification of the phenolic compound 2(-4 hydroxyphenyl)-ethanol (Tyrosol). Its antimicrobial reaction was tested and the ensuing antagonistic effects on the human pathogenic bacteria Enterococcus hirae , Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus , Salmonella typhi , Staphylococcus aureus , phytopathogenic Xanthomonas asc. phaseoli and phytopathogenic fungi were demonstrated.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 2Œ±-subunit (eIF2Œ±) is a key player in initiation of protein translation and is regulated by phosphorylation. While this factor is sensitive to changing synaptic input and is critical for synaptic plasticity, its sensitivity to stimulants is poorly understood. Here we systematically characterized responses of eIF2Œ± to a systemic administration of the stimulant amphetamine (AMPH) in dopamine responsive regions of adult rat brains. Intraperitoneal injection of AMPH at 5 mg/kg increased eIF2Œ± phosphorylation at serine 51 in the striatum. This increase was transient. In the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), AMPH induced a relatively delayed phosphorylation of the factor. Pretreatment with a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 blocked the AMPH-stimulated eIF2Œ± phosphorylation in both the striatum and mPFC. Similarly, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride reduced the effect of AMPH in the two regions. Two antagonists alone did not alter basal eIF2Œ± phosphorylation. AMPH and two antagonists did not change the amount of total eIF2Œ± proteins in both regions. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of eIF2Œ± to stimulant exposure. AMPH possesses the ability to stimulate eIF2Œ± phosphorylation in striatal and mPFC neurons in vivo in a D1 and D2 receptor-dependent manner. ",Brain research,NEURO
0.316131856,19478886,Comparative Genomic Characterization of  Francisella tularensis  Strains Belonging to Low and High Virulence Subspecies,"Tularemia is a geographically widespread, severely debilitating, and occasionally lethal disease in humans. It is caused by infection by a gram-negative bacterium, Francisella tularensis . In order to better understand its potency as an etiological agent as well as its potential as a biological weapon, we have completed draft assemblies and report the first complete genomic characterization of five strains belonging to the following different Francisella subspecies (subsp.): the F. tularensis subsp. tularensis FSC033, F. tularensis subsp. holarctica FSC257 and FSC022, and F. tularensis subsp. novicida GA99-3548 and GA99-3549 strains. Here, we report the sequencing of these strains and comparative genomic analysis with recently available public Francisella sequences, including the rare F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica FSC147 strain isolate from the Central Asian Region. We report evidence for the occurrence of large-scale rearrangement events in strains of the holarctica subspecies, supporting previous proposals that further phylogenetic subdivisions of the Type B clade are likely. We also find a significant enrichment of disrupted or absent ORFs proximal to predicted breakpoints in the FSC022 strain, including a genetic component of the Type I restriction-modification defense system. Many of the pseudogenes identified are also disrupted in the closely related rarely human pathogenic F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica FSC147 strain, including modulator of drug activity B ( mdaB ) (FTT0961), which encodes a known NADPH quinone reductase involved in oxidative stress resistance. We have also identified genes exhibiting sequence similarity to effectors of the Type III (T3SS) and components of the Type IV secretion systems (T4SS). One of the genes, msrA2 (FTT1797c), is disrupted in F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica and has recently been shown to mediate bacterial pathogen survival in host organisms. Our findings suggest that in addition to the duplication of the Francisella Pathogenicity Island, and acquisition of individual loci, adaptation by gene loss in the more recently emerged tularensis , holarctica , and mediasiatica subspecies occurred and was distinct from evolutionary events that differentiated these subspecies, and the novicida subspecies, from a common ancestor. Our findings are applicable to future studies focused on variations in Francisella subspecies pathogenesis, and of broader interest to studies of genomic pathoadaptation in bacteria. Author Summary Tularemia is a zoonotic disease that is widely disseminated throughout the Northern Hemisphere and is caused by different strain types of bacteria belonging to the genus Francisella. In general, Francisella tularensis subspecies are able to infect a wide range of mammals including humans and are often transmitted via insect vectors such as ticks. Depending on the strain and route of infection the disease may be fatal in humans. In order to better understand F. tularensis as an etiological agent as well as its potential as a biological weapon, we have completed draft sequence assemblies of five globally diverse strains. We have performed a comparative analysis of these sequences with other available public Francisella sequences of strains of differing virulence. Our analysis suggests that genome rearrangements and gene loss in specific Francisella subspecies may underlie the evolution of niche adaptation and virulence of this pathogen.",PLoS pathogens,IMMUN

Yet, functional implications of knotted DNA are not fully understood. Moreover, potential applications of DNA molecules condensed by means of knotting remain to be explored. A convenient method to produce abundant highly knotted DNA would be highly valuable for these studies. Results We had previously shown that circularization of the 11.2 kb linear DNA of phage P4 inside its viral capsid generates complex knots by the effect of confinement. We demonstrate here that this mechanism is not restricted to the viral genome. We constructed DNA cosmids as small as 5 kb and introduced them inside P4 capsids. Such cosmids were then recovered as a complex mixture of highly knotted DNA circles. Over 250 Œºg of knotted cosmid were typically obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture. Conclusion With this biological system, DNA molecules of varying length and sequence can be shaped into very complex and heterogeneous knotted forms. These molecules can be produced in preparative amounts suitable for systematic studies and applications.",BMC biotechnology,ENG

We identified 626 up-regulated and 636 down-regulated genes in DCM compared to controls. Most significant changes occurred in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, angiogenesis, and apoptotic signaling pathways, among which 32 apoptosis- and 13 MAPK activity-related genes were altered. Inorganic cation transporter, catalytic activities, energy metabolism and electron transport-related processes were among the most critically influenced pathways. Among the up-regulated genes were HTRA1 (6.9-fold), PDCD8(AIFM1) (5.2) and PRDX2 (4.4) and the down-regulated genes were NR4A2 (4.8), MX1 (4.3), LGALS9 (4), IFNA13 (4), UNC5D (3.6) and HDAC2 (3) (pb0.05), all of which have no clearly defined cardiac-related function yet. Gene ontology and enrichment analysis also revealed significant alterations in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease pathways. Concordance was also confirmed for a significant number of genes and pathways in an independent validation microarray dataset. Furthermore, verification by real-time RT-PCR showed a high degree of consistency with the microarray results. Our data demonstrate an association of DCM with alterations in various cellular events and multiple yet undeciphered genes that may contribute to heart muscle disease pathways. ",Genomics,BIOCHEM

Here we unveiled a previously unrecognized role of TET2 in mediating p53-loss induced chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer. Deletion of TET2 in p53KO colon cancer cells enhanced DNA damage and restored chemotherapy sensitivity. By taking a two-pronged approach that combined pharmacological inhibition with genetic depletion, we discovered that p53 destabilized TET2 at protein level by promoting its autophagic degradation. At the molecular level, we further revealed a physical association between TET2 and p53 that facilitated the nucleoplasmic shuttling of TET2, as well as its recruitment to the autophagosome for degradation. Our study has unveiled a functional interplay between TET2 and p53 during anti-cancer therapy. Our findings establish the rationale for targeting TET2 to overcome chemotherapy resistance associated with mutant p53 tumors. ",Oncogene,ONCO

Both male and female M. sjostedti were attracted to male, but not to female odor. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses revealed the presence of two distinct compounds in male M. sjostedti headspace, namely ( R )-lavandulyl 3-methylbutanoate (major compound) and ( R )-lavandulol (minor compound); by contrast, both compounds were only present in trace amounts in female headspace collections.

To quantitate the kinetics of myeloid cell movement during homeostasis, we applied 5-bromo-2‚Ä≤-deoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse labeling in healthy rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) followed by hematology and flow cytometry analyses. Results were applied to a mathematical model and the blood circulating half-life and daily production, respectively, of each cell type from macaques aged 5‚Äì10 years old were calculated for; neutrophils (1.63 ¬± 0.16 days, 1.42 √ó 10 9 cells/L/day), basophils (1.78 ¬± 0.30 days, 5.89 √ó 10 6 cells/L/day), and CD14 + CD16 ‚àí classical monocytes (1.01 ¬± 0.15 days, 3.09 √ó 10 8 cells/L/day). Classical monocytes were released into the blood circulation as early as one day after dividing, while neutrophils remained in bone marrow 4-5 days before being released. Among granulocytes, neutrophils and basophils exhibited distinct kinetics in bone marrow maturation time and blood circulation. With increasing chronological age, there was a significant decrease in daily production of neutrophils and basophils but the half-life of these granulocytes remained unchanged between 3-19 years of age. In contrast, daily production of classical monocytes remained stable through 19 years of age but exhibited a significant decline in half-life.

Artemisia tridentata is a widespread and foundational shrub species in western North America. This species has become extremely fragmented, to the detriment of dependent wildlife, and efforts to restore it are now a land management priority. Common‚Äêgarden experiments were established at three sites with seedlings from 55 source‚Äêpopulations. Populations included each of the three predominant subspecies, and cytotype variations. Survival was monitored for 5¬†years to assess differences in survival between gardens and populations. We found evidence of adaptive genetic variation for survival. Survival within gardens differed by source‚Äêpopulation and a substantial proportion of this variation was explained by seed climate of origin. Plants from areas with the coldest winters had the highest levels of survival, while populations from warmer and drier sites had the lowest levels of survival. Survival was lowest, 36%, in the garden that was prone to the lowest minimum temperatures. These results suggest the importance of climatic driven genetic differences and their effect on survival. Understanding how genetic variation is arrayed across the landscape, and its association with climate can greatly enhance the success of restoration and conservation.",Evolutionary applications,ECO

Results Water deficit progressively decreased shoot elongation, stomatal conductance and photosynthesis after Day 4; 2277 proteins were identified by shotgun proteomics with an average CV of 9% for the protein abundance of all proteins. There were 472 out of 942 (50%) proteins found in all samples that were significantly affected by water deficit. The 472 proteins were clustered into four groups: increased and decreased abundance of early- and late-responding protein profiles. Vines sensed the water deficit early, appearing to acclimate to stress, because the abundance of many proteins changed before decreases in shoot elongation, stomatal conductance and photosynthesis. Predominant functional categories of the early-responding proteins included photosynthesis, glycolysis, translation, antioxidant defense and growth-related categories (steroid metabolism and water transport), whereas additional proteins for late-responding proteins were largely involved with transport, photorespiration, antioxidants, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. Conclusions Proteomic responses to water deficit were dynamic with early, significant changes in abundance of proteins involved in translation, energy, antioxidant defense and steroid metabolism. The abundance of these proteins changed prior to any detectable decreases in shoot elongation, stomatal conductance or photosynthesis. Many of these early-responding proteins are known to be regulated by post-transcriptional modifications such as phosphorylation. The proteomics analysis indicates massive and substantial changes in plant metabolism that appear to funnel carbon and energy into antioxidant defenses in the very early stages of plant response to water deficit before any significant injury.",BMC plant biology,ANIMAL
0.844248472,29671669,Confirmation and Refinement of the Heterozygous Deletion of the Small Leucine-rich Proteoglycans Associated with Posterior Amorphous Corneal Dystrophy,"  Purpose:  To present the clinical and cytogenetic features of a previously unreported family with posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy (PACD) associated with a heterozygous deletion of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan genes on chromosome 12.    Methods:  Clinical characterization was performed using slit lamp biomicroscopic and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Genomic DNA was collected from affected and unaffected family members, and a cytogenomic array was used to identify copy number variations (CNV) present in the PACD locus.    Results:  Three members of a Guatemalan family presented with clinical characteristics consistent with PACD: bilateral posterior stromal lamellar opacification, decreased corneal curvature and iridocorneal adhesions. OCT imaging demonstrated decreased corneal thickness and hyperreflectivity of the posterior third of the corneal stroma. CNV analysis confirmed the presumed clinical diagnosis of PACD by revealing a 0.304 Mb heterozygous deletion in the PACD locus on chromosome 12 that included the four small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) genes ( KERA, LUM, DCN, and EPYC ) deleted in each of the PACD families in which CNV analysis has been reported.    Conclusions:  This is the first report of the OCT appearance of PACD and the second confirmation of a heterozygous deletion of chromosome 12q21.33 as the cause of PACD, highlighting the utility of array-based cytogenomics to confirm the suspected clinical diagnosis of PACD. As the smallest previously reported pathogenic deletion was 0.701 Mb, the 0.304 Mb deletion we report is the smallest identified to date and reduces the size of the PACD locus to 0.275 Mb.

0.397979284,29238217,"Effects of voluntary exercise on blood pressure, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and renal function in two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats","Spontaneous dynamic exercise promotes sympathoinhibition and decreases arterial pressure in two-kidney, one-clip (2K-1C) hypertensive rats. Renal sympathetic nerves stimulate renin secretion and increase renal tubular sodium reabsorption. We hypothesized that daily voluntary wheel running exercise by 2K-1C rats will decrease mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma angiotensin II (Ang II), and aldosterone as well as normalize urinary sodium and potassium excretion independent of changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Five-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats underwent sham clipping (Sham) or right renal artery clipping (2K-1C). Rats were randomized to standard caging (SED) or cages with running wheels (EX). After 12 weeks, rats were assigned to either collection of aortic blood for measurement of Ang II and aldosterone or assessment of inulin clearances and excretory function. Running distances were comparable in both EX groups. MAP was lower in 2K-1C EX vs 2K-1C SED rats ( P <0.05). Plasma Ang II and aldosterone were significantly higher in 2K-1C SED rats and decreased in 2K-1C EX rats to levels similar to Sham SED or Sham EX rats. Clipped kidney weights were significantly lower in both 2K-1C groups, but GFR and urine flow rates were no different from right and left kidneys among the four groups. Total and fractional sodium excretion rates from the unclipped kidney of 2K-1C SED rats were higher vs either Sham group ( P <0.05). Values in 2K-1C EX rats were similar to the Sham groups. Potassium excretion paralleled sodium excretion. These studies show that voluntary dynamic exercise in 2K-1C rats decreases plasma Ang II and aldosterone, which contribute to the lower arterial pressure without deleterious effects on GFR. The effects on sodium excretion underscore the impact of pressure natriuresis despite elevated plasma Ang II and aldosterone in sedentary 2K-1C rats. In contrast, potassium excretion is primarily regulated by circulating aldosterone and distal sodium delivery.",Integrated blood pressure control,CLINIC

New metabolites of CB3, including 2OH-CB3 and 3OH-CB3, were confirmed in whole poplars ( Populus deltoides √ó nigra , DN34), a model plant in the application of phytoremediation. Furthermore, the concentrations and masses of 2OH-CB3 and 3OH-CB3 formed in various tissues of whole poplar plants and controls were measured. Results showed that 2OH-CB3 was the major product in these two OH-CB3s with chlorine and hydroxyl moieties in the same phenyl ring of CB3. Masses of 2OH-CB3 and 3OH-CB3 in tissues of whole poplar plants were much higher than those in the hydroponic solution, strongly indicating that the poplar plant itself metabolizes CB3 to both 2OH-CB3 and 3OH-CB3. The total yield of 2OH-CB3 and 3OH-CB3, with chlorine and hydroxyl in the same phenyl ring of CB3, was less than that of three previously found OH-CB3s with chlorine and hydroxyl in the opposite phenyl rings of CB3 (2'OH-CB3, 3'OH-CB3, and 4'OH-CB3). Finally, these two newly detected OH-CB3s from CB3 in this work also suggests that the metabolic pathway was via epoxide intermediates. These five OH-CB3s clearly showed the complete metabolism profile from CB3 to monohydroxylated CB3. More importantly, it's the first report and confirmation of 2OH-CB3 and 3OH-CB3 (new metabolites of CB3) in a living organism.",Chemistry Central journal,BIOCHEM

While at workplace, anesthesiologist is exposed to a wide array of potential hazards that can be detrimental to his overall health. Numerous risks and safety concerns have been mentioned in the literature, but the magnitude of challenges in anesthesiology practice are far greater than those cited and anticipated. Many times these challenging situations are unavoidable and the attending anesthesiologist has to deal with them on an individual basis. These hazards not only affect the general health but can be extremely threatening in various other ways that can increase the potential risks of morbidity and mortality. This article is an attempt to bring a general awareness among anesthesia fraternity about the various health hazards associated with anesthesia practice. Also, a genuine attempt has been made to enumerate the various preventive methods and precautions that should be adopted to make practice of anesthesiology safe and smooth.","Anesthesia, essays and researches",CLINIC

We identified a cohort of 148 female BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers (115 and 33, respectively) who previously were treated for unilateral invasive breast cancer stages I‚ÄìIIIa. In all, 79 women underwent a CPM, while the other women remained under intensive surveillance. The mean follow-up was 3.5 years and started at the time of CPM or at the date of mutation testing, whichever came last, that is, on average 5 years after diagnosis of the first breast cancer. One woman developed an invasive contralateral primary breast cancer after CPM, whereas six were observed in the surveillance group ( P <0.001). Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy reduced the risk of contralateral breast cancer by 91%, independent of the effect of bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy (BPO). At 5 years follow-up, overall survival was 94% for the CPM group vs 77% for the surveillance group ( P =0.03), but this was unexpectedly mostly due to higher mortality related with first breast cancer and ovarian cancer in the surveillance group. After adjustment for BPO in a multivariate Cox analysis, the CPM effect on overall survival was no longer significant. Our data show that CPM markedly reduces the risk of contralateral breast cancer among BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers with a history of breast cancer. Longer follow-up is needed to study the impact of CPM on contralateral breast cancer-specific survival. The choice for CPM is highly correlated with that for BPO, while only BPO leads to a significant improvement in overall survival so far.",British journal of cancer,ONCO

Formation of G4s suppresses MYC transcription and can be modulated by drug binding, establishing these DNA structures as promising targets in cancer therapy. The NHE III 1 motif can fold into more than one parallel G4s, including 1:2:1 and 1:6:1 loop length conformers, with the 1:2:1 conformer shown as the major species under physiological conditions in solution. However, additional factors such as protein interactions may affect the cellular folding equilibrium. Nucleolin, a protein shown to bind MYC G4 and repress MYC transcription, is reported herein to preferably bind to the 1:6:1 loop length conformer suggesting a physiological significance of this species. The high-resolution NMR solution structure of the 1:6:1 conformer is determined, which reveals a 5‚Ä≤-capping structure distinctive from the 1:2:1 form, with the 6 nt central loop playing an essential role for this specific capping structure. This suggests that each parallel G-quadruplex likely adopts unique capping and loop structures determined by the specific central loop and flanking sequences. The resulting structural information at the molecular level will help to understand protein recognition of different G4s, contribution of G4 polymorphism to gene regulation, and to rationally design small molecules selectively targeting the 1:6:1 MYC G4.",ACS omega,CHEM

Methods The study used a retrospective, mixed-methods comparative case study design, including a literature review; site visits; interviews with investigators, stakeholders, and decision makers for 23 HIAs in 16 states that were completed from 2005 through 2013; and a Web-based survey of 144 HIA practitioners. Results Analysis of interviews with decision makers suggests HIAs can directly influence decisions in nonhealth-related sectors. HIAs may also influence changes beyond the decision target, build consensus and relationships among decision makers and their constituents, and give community members a stronger voice in decisions that affect them. Factors that may increase HIA success include care in choosing a project or policy to be examined‚Äô selecting an appropriate team to conduct the HIA; engaging stakeholders and decision makers throughout the process; crafting clear, actionable recommendations; delivering timely, compelling messages to appropriate audiences; and using multiple dissemination methods. Challenges to successful HIAs include underestimating the level of effort required, political changes during the conduct of the HIA, accessing relevant local data, engaging vulnerable populations, and following up on recommendations.

Such disorders include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia caused by a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene (c9FTD/ALS). We and others have recently shown that this bidirectionally transcribed repeat is RAN translated, and the ‚Äúc9RAN proteins‚Äù thusly produced form neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system of c9FTD/ALS patients. Nonetheless, the potential contribution of c9RAN proteins to disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that poly(GA) c9RAN proteins are neurotoxic and may be implicated in the neurodegenerative processes of c9FTD/ALS. Specifically, we show that expression of poly(GA) proteins in cultured cells and primary neurons leads to the formation of soluble and insoluble high molecular weight species, as well as inclusions composed of filaments similar to those observed in c9FTD/ALS brain tissues. The expression of poly(GA) proteins is accompanied by caspase-3 activation, impaired neurite outgrowth, inhibition of proteasome activity, and evidence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Of importance, ER stress inhibitors, salubrinal and TUDCA, provide protection against poly(GA)-induced toxicity. Taken together, our data provide compelling evidence towards establishing RAN translation as a pathogenic mechanism of c9FTD/ALS, and suggest that targeting the ER using small molecules may be a promising therapeutic approach for these devastating diseases.

Here, we investigated if mRNA events that are upregulated in cancer can functionally mimic the outcome of genetic alterations. 3‚Ä≤-seq or RNA-seq were applied to normal and malignant B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; N = 59) 1 ‚Äì 3 . We discovered widespread upregulation of truncated mRNAs and proteins in primary CLL cells that were not generated by genetic alterations but occurred through intronic polyadenylation (IPA). IPA-generated truncated mRNAs were recurrent ( N = 330) and predominantly affected genes with tumor-suppressive functions. The IPA-generated truncated proteins often lack the tumor-suppressive functions of the corresponding full-length proteins (DICER, FOXN3), and several even acted in an oncogenic manner (CARD11, MGA, CHST11). In CLL, inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) through aberrant mRNA processing is substantially more prevalent than loss of TSGs through genetic events. We further identified novel TSG candidates that are inactivated by IPA in leukemia and by truncating DNA mutations in solid tumors 4 , 5 . These genes are understudied in cancer as their overall mutation rates are lower than those of well-known TSGs. Our findings show the need to go beyond genomic analyses in cancer diagnostics, as mRNA events that are silent at the DNA level are widespread contributors to cancer pathogenesis through inactivation of TSGs.

Obesity is a major factor influencing the blood pressure response to exercise since evidence indicates that the arterial pressure response to exercise is exacerbated in obese compared with lean adults. Signs of augmented responses (such as an exaggerated blood pressure response) to physical exertion appear early in life (from the prepubertal years) in obese individuals. Understanding the mechanisms that drive the altered hemodynamic responses during exercise in obese individuals and prevent the progression to hypertension is vitally important. This paper focuses on the evidence linking obesity with alterations of the autonomic nervous system and discusses the potential mechanisms and consequences of the altered sympathetic nervous system behavior in obese individuals at rest and during exercise.

Heat shock rapidly and reversibly induced a decrease in polysome abundance and the consequent changes in mRNA metabolism were studied. Both heat shock and polysome dissociation were necessary for (i) a reduction in mRNA levels that was more rapid than normal turnover, (ii) an increased number of P-body-like granules that contained DHH1, SCD6 and XRNA, (iii) the formation of stress granules that remained largely separate from the P-body-like granules and localized to the periphery of the cell and, (iv) an increase in the size of a novel focus located at the posterior pole of the cell that contained XRNA, but neither DHH1, nor SCD6.

We show here that Islet-1 acts genetically downstream of Phox2B in cells of the sympathoadrenal cell lineage and that the development of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells is impaired in mouse embryos with a conditional deletion of Islet-1 controlled by the wnt1 promotor. Islet-1 is not essential for the initial differentiation of sympathoadrenal cells, as indicated by the correct expression of pan-neuronal and catecholaminergic subtype specific genes in primary sympathetic ganglia of Islet-1 deficient mouse embryos. However, our data indicate that the subsequent survival of sympathetic neuron precursors and their differentiation towards TrkA expressing neurons depends on Islet-1 function. In contrast to spinal sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons of Islet-1 deficient mice did not display ectopic expression of genes normally present in the CNS. In Islet-1 deficient mouse embryos the numbers of chromaffin cells were only mildly reduced, in contrast to that of sympathetic neurons, but the initiation of the adrenaline synthesizing enzyme PNMT was abrogated and the expression level of chromogranin A was diminished. Microarray analysis revealed that developing chromaffin cells of Islet-1 deficient mice displayed normal expression levels of TH, DBH and the transcription factors Phox2B, Mash-1, Hand2, Gata3 and Insm1, but the expression levels of the transcription factors Gata2 and Hand1, and AP-2Œ≤ were significantly reduced.

Methods Patients aged 18‚Äì65¬†years were randomly assigned to rituximab or placebo. Protocol‚Äêstipulated interim analysis quantified the efficacy of B‚Äêcell depletion. Results The efficacy on cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarkers failed to reach criteria for continuation of the trial. B‚Äêcell‚Äêrelated CSF biomarkers ( sCD 21 and B‚Äêcell activating factor) changed only in the active‚Äêtreatment arm. While CSF B cells were killed robustly (median ‚àí79.71%, P =¬†0.0176), B cells in CNS tissue were depleted inadequately (~‚àí10‚Äì20%, P <¬†0.0001). Consequently, the T‚Äêcell‚Äêspecific CSF biomarker sCD 27 decreased slightly (‚àí10.97%, P =¬†0.0005), while axonal damage marker, neurofilament light chain did not change.

One of the most promising technologies for this type of networks is 802.15.4/ZigBee. This paper presents an empirical characterization of battery consumption in commercial 802.15.4/ZigBee motes. This characterization is based on the measurement of the current that is drained from the power source under different 802.15.4 communication operations. The measurements permit the definition of an analytical model to predict the maximum, minimum and mean expected battery lifetime of a sensor networking application as a function of the sensor duty cycle and the size of the sensed data.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",ENG
0.21440796,31131365,Understanding consumer preferences for care of adolescents with pelvic inflammatory disease *,"  Objective.  The objective of this study is to estimate consumers‚Äô maximum willingness-to-pay (WTP) for follow-up PID services by physicians and community health nurses (CHNs), differences by consumer type (adolescents versus parents), and the differences in health-provider predicted WTP consumer estimates and actual consumer WTP estimates.    Methods.  In this IRB-approved study, a contingent valuation method was used to collect WTP data regarding co-payments to physicians or nurses for clinical service delivery from the consumers of adolescent PID services (parents and adolescents) and health providers using a national convenience sample. Consumers were recruited from an academic pediatric and adolescent medicine clinic and five health department school-based health clinics in a large urban community with high (sexually transmitted infection) STI prevalence. Participants completed a web-based survey. Data were analyzed using linear regression analyses.    Results.  Adolescents were willing to pay $36 more (95 % Cl : $27.9‚Äì44.3) for community health nursing care and parents were willing to pay $48 more dollars (95 % Cl : $40.3-$57.4) than physician‚Äôs predicted. There were no significant differences in adolescent and parents WTP for physician or nursing services Consumers (adolescents & parents) WTP for physician PID services were on average $18.50 higher than CHN PID services (p = 0.01). Using physician estimates for WTP as the reference group, adolescents were willing to pay $56 more (95 % Cl : $48.6-$63.4) for physician care and parents were willing to pay $66 more (95 % Cl : $59.0-$72.8) than physician‚Äôs predicted.    Conclusion.  Adolescents and parents are willing to pay more for physician follow-up for PID, but they are open to CHN follow-up visits based on the mean WTP for CHN visits. Since WTP also reflects the value that individuals place on a service, our data demonstrate that providers consistently underestimate the value consumers place on clinical services for x adolescents with PID.

0.786710974,29843048,Reduction of the molecular chaperone BiP accentuates the effect of aging on sleep-wake behavior," Sleep and wake quality, quantity and architecture become modified with aging. Sleep and wake quality decline coinciding with increased fragmentation of both states across aging. We have previously shown that this age-related decline in sleep-wake quality is associated with increased endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress and decreased expression of the major ER chaperone BiP (Binding immunoglobulin Protein). BiP, also known as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), plays a key role in controlling the cellular response to ER stress, acting as a regulator of a protein homeostatic signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Induction of BiP during cellular stress is part of an adaptive pro-survival mechanism. Here, using mice heterozygous for BiP, we investigated the effect of reduced BiP expression on sleep-wake behavior across aging; complete knockdown of BiP is embryonic lethal. We report that BiP heterozygosity accentuates the aging sleep-wake phenotype. Sleep and wake fragmentation was more pronounced in the BiP heterozygotes across the three ages examined. In mice lacking one functional copy of BiP, we observed an age-related significant reduction in wake bout duration and increase in wake bout numbers during the active period, as well as an increase in NREM and REM bout numbers accompanied by reduced bout durations of both NREM and REM during the sleep period. In addition, we observed increased ER stress in orexin neurons as well as occurrence of aggregates immunopositive for orexin at the terminals and projections of orexin neurons in the middle aged BiP heterozygotes. Taken together, our data indicates that a reduction in the molecular chaperone BiP impacts sleep architecture across aging and that orexin processing is likely to be affected.

0.661484018,30195946,"Effect of Intranasal Vasoconstrictors on Blood Pressure: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial","  Background:  Treatment for epistaxis includes application of intranasal vasoconstrictors. These medications have a precaution against use in patients with hypertension. Given that many patients who present with epistaxis are hypertensive, these warnings are commonly overridden by clinical necessity.    Objectives:  To determine the effects of these medications on blood pressure.    Methods:  We conducted a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from November 2014 through July 2016. Adult patients being discharged from the emergency department (ED) at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) were recruited. Patients were ineligible if they had a contraindication to study medications, had a history of hypertension, were currently taking antihypertensive or antiarrhythmic medications, or had nasal abnormalities such as epistaxis. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 study arms (phenylephrine 0.25%; oxymetazoline 0.05%; lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000; or bacteriostatic 0.9% sodium chloride [saline]). Blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.    Results:  Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in the study; of these, 63 patients completed the study (oxymetazoline, n=15; phenylephrine, n=20; lidocaine with epinephrine, n=11; saline, n=17). We did not observe any significant differences in mean arterial pressure over time between phenylephrine and saline, oxymetazoline and saline, or lidocaine with epinephrine and saline. The mean greatest increases from baseline in mean arterial pressure, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate for each treatment group also were not significantly different from the saline group.    Conclusion:  Intranasal vasoconstrictors did not significantly increase blood pressure in patients without a history of hypertension. Our findings reinforce the practice of administering these medications to patients who present to the ED with epistaxis, regardless of high blood pressure.

0.346434915,25690937,DNA damage response markers are differentially expressed in  BRCA -mutated breast cancers,"Cells have stringent DNA repair pathways that are specific for each different set of DNA lesions which is accomplished through the integration of complex array of proteins. However, BRCA -mutated breast cancer (BC) has defective DNA repair mechanisms. This study aims to investigate differential expression of a large panel of DNA repair markers to characterise DNA repair mechanisms in BRCA -associated tumours compared to sporadic tumours in an attempt to characterise these tumours in routine practice. Immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray technology were applied to a cohort of clinically annotated series of sporadic ( n =¬†1849), BRCA1 -mutated ( n =¬†48), and BRCA2-mutated ( n =¬†27) BC. The following DNA damage response (DDR) markers are used; BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, Ku70/Ku80, BARD, PARP1 (cleaved), PARP1 (non-cleaved), and P53 in addition to basal cytokeratins, ER, PR, and HER2. A significant proportion of BRCA 1 tumours were positive for PARP1 (non-cleaved), and negative for BARD1 and RAD51 compared with sporadic BC. BRCA 2 tumours were significantly positive for PARP1 (non-cleaved) compared with sporadic tumours. RAD51 was significantly higher in BRCA 1 compared with BRCA 2 tumours ( p =¬†0.005). When BRCA 1/2 BCs were compared to triple-negative (TN) sporadic tumours of the studied DDR proteins, BARD1 ( p <¬†0.001), PARP1 (non-cleaved) ( p <¬†0.001), and P53 ( p =¬†0.002) remained significantly different in BRCA 1/2 tumours compared with TN BC. DNA repair markers showed differential expression in BRCA -mutated tumours, with a substantial degree of disruption of DNA repair pathways in sporadic BC especially TN BC. DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is assisted by PARP1 expression in BRCA-mutated tumours, whereas the loss of DSB repair via RAD51 is predominant in BRCA 1 rather than BRCA 2 BC.

0.416445271,25973951,HIF-1Œ± regulates the response of primary sarcomas to radiation therapy through a cell autonomous mechanism," Hypoxia is a major cause of radiation resistance, which may predispose to local recurrence after radiation therapy (RT). While hypoxia increases tumor cell survival after RT because there is less oxygen to oxidize damaged DNA, whether signaling pathways triggered by hypoxia contribute to radiation resistance is poorly understood. For example, intratumoral hypoxia can increase hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1Œ±), which may regulate pathways that contribute to radiation sensitization or radiation resistance. To clarify the role of HIF-1Œ± in regulating tumor response to radiation therapy, we generated a novel genetically engineered mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma with an intact or deleted HIF-1Œ±. Deletion of HIF-1Œ± sensitized primary sarcomas to RT in vivo. Moreover, cell lines derived from primary sarcomas lacking HIF-1Œ±, or in which HIF-1Œ± was knocked down, had decreased clonogenic survival in vitro , demonstrating that HIF-1Œ± can promote radiation resistance in a cell autonomous manner. In HIF-1Œ± intact and deleted sarcoma cells, radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage repair, and activation of autophagy were similar. However, sarcoma cells lacking HIF-1Œ± had impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic response after radiation which might contribute to radiation resistance. These results show that HIF-1Œ± promotes radiation resistance in a cell autonomous manner. ",Radiation research,ONCO

Design In this observational study, changes in outcome measures were monitored with habituation to caging. Continuous focal observations of the activity, location in the cage, and posture were conducted from video recordings for one 24-hour period/week/cat. Cat-Stress-Scores were recorded daily. All faecal samples were collected for analysis of FGM. Results The percentage time spent eating increased, while percentage time spent grooming decreased, from week 1 to week 2. Cat-Stress-Score declined significantly from week 1 to week 2. FGM concentrations were significantly greater in week 1 than in week 5. A posthabituation time budget of the behaviour of the cats in the single cages showed that inactivity dominated the time budget and the cats were located on the shelf almost half of the time. Conclusions Results suggests that a shelf was a resource of value to the cats, and that its inclusion in enclosure design is important. Quantitative and qualitative behavioural data indicated that there was an initial stress response to caging that stabilised after the first week, while FGM concentration took longer to stabilise.",Veterinary record open,ANIMAL
0.048738345,29885817,Osteopontin attenuates inflammation via JAK2/STAT1 pathway in hyperglycemic rats after intracerebral hemorrhage," Acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) complicated by hyperglycemia is associated with aggravation of post-stroke inflammation, leading to exacerbation of brain edema and predicting poor neurological outcomes and higher mortality of patients. Osteopontin (OPN) is a neuroprotective glycoprotein, which is able to attenuate brain injury induced by hemorrhagic stroke. In the current study we investigated whether OPN will decrease the inflammatory post-ICH response as well as attenuate brain edema and neurological deficits in hyperglycemic rats. We employed a collagenase model of ICH on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 148) rats and 50% of Dextrose was injected intraperitoneally (i.p) 3 h after ICH (ICH + HG). Intranasal administration of recombinant OPN (rOPN) was performed 1 h after ICH. The development of brain injury was evaluated by brain water content (BWC) and neurological deficits, western blot and immunohistochemistry study. Small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) for integrin-Œ≤1 receptor and a JAK2 agonist, Coumermycin A1 (C-A1), were used for detailed investigation of the molecular pathway. The administration of OPN (3 Œºg) significantly improved neurobehavior and increased expression of OPN and integrin-Œ≤1 receptor in the brain followed with decrease of neutrophil infiltration, JAK2, STAT1, TNF-a, IL-1b, MMP-9 and brain edema in the ICH + HG + OPN rats compared with ICH + HG rats. The effects of OPN were reversed by the intervention of intergrin-Œ≤1 siRNA and C-A1. In conclusion, rOPN attenuated ICH-induced brain inflammation in hyperglycemic rats, leading to attenuation of brain edema and improving neurological functions. Effects of rOPN were mediated at least partly by integrin-Œ≤1 induced inhibition of JAK2/STAT1 pathway. ",Neuropharmacology,NEURO
0.312273916,29963657,Regulation of microtubule dynamic instability by the carboxy-terminal tail of Œ≤-tubulin,"This work examines how the carboxy-terminal tail domain of Œ≤-tubulin governs microtubule dynamic instability and the structure of plus ends using complementary in vivo and in vitro experiments. Dynamic instability is an intrinsic property of microtubules; however, we do not understand what domains of Œ±Œ≤-tubulins regulate this activity or how these regulate microtubule networks in cells. Here, we define a role for the negatively charged carboxy-terminal tail (CTT) domain of Œ≤-tubulin in regulating dynamic instability. By combining in vitro studies with purified mammalian tubulin and in vivo studies with tubulin mutants in budding yeast, we demonstrate that Œ≤-tubulin CTT inhibits microtubule stability and regulates the structure and stability of microtubule plus ends. Tubulin that lacks Œ≤-tubulin CTT polymerizes faster and depolymerizes slower in vitro and forms microtubules that are more prone to catastrophe. The ends of these microtubules exhibit a more blunted morphology and rapidly switch to disassembly after tubulin depletion. In addition, we show that Œ≤-tubulin CTT is required for magnesium cations to promote depolymerization. We propose that Œ≤-tubulin CTT regulates the assembly of stable microtubule ends and provides a tunable mechanism to coordinate dynamic instability with ionic strength in the cell.",Life science alliance,BIOCHEM

Conterminous South Africa including the countries of Lesotho and Swaziland Digital databases of rodent museum specimens housed in the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History, South Africa (DM), and the Division of Mammals, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, United States (NMNH), were acquired and then sorted into a subset of specimens with associated coordinate data. The coordinate data were then used to develop distributional maps for the rodent genera present within the study area. Percent habitat occupation and descriptive statistics for six climatic variables were then determined for each genus by cross-referencing locality positions with vegetation and climatic maps. This report presents a series of maps illustrating the distribution of 35 rodent genera based on 19,471 geo-referenced specimens obtained from two major collections. Inferred habitat use by taxon is provided for both locality and specimen percent occurrence at three hierarchical habitat levels: biome, bioregion, and vegetation unit. Descriptive statistics for six climatic variables are also provided for each genus based on locality and specimen percent incidence. As rodent faunas are commonly used in paleoenvironmental reconstructions, an accurate assessment of rodent environmental tolerance ranges is necessary before confidence can be placed in an actualistic model.

Methods In this study, we assessed the suitability of patient-derived tumour xenografts (PDXs) for methylome analysis using Infinium 450 K Beadchips and MeDIP-seq. Results Controlled for confounding host (mouse) sequences, comparison of primary PDXs and matching patient tumours in a rare (osteosarcoma) and common (colon) cancer revealed that an average 2.7% of the assayed CpG sites undergo major (ŒîŒ≤‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ0.51) methylation changes in a cancer-specific manner as a result of the xenografting procedure. No significant subsequent methylation changes were observed after a second round of xenografting between primary and secondary PDXs. Based on computational simulation using publically available methylation data, we additionally show that future studies comparing two groups of PDXs should use 15 or more samples in each group to minimise the impact of xenografting-associated changes in methylation on comparison results. Conclusions Our results from rare and common cancers indicate that PDXs are a suitable discovery tool for cancer epigenomics and we provide guidance on how to overcome the observed limitations.

0.798407923,27922009,PET imaging-guided chemogenetic silencing reveals a critical role of primate rostromedial caudate in reward evaluation,"The rostromedial caudate (rmCD) of primates is thought to contribute to reward value processing, but a causal relationship has not been established. Here we use an inhibitory DREADD (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug) to repeatedly and non-invasively inactivate rmCD of macaque monkeys. We inject an adeno-associated viral vector expressing the inhibitory DREADD, hM4Di, into the rmCD bilaterally. To visualize DREADD expression in vivo , we develop a non-invasive imaging method using positron emission tomography (PET). PET imaging provides information critical for successful chemogenetic silencing during experiments, in this case the location and level of hM4Di expression, and the relationship between agonist dose and hM4Di receptor occupancy. Here we demonstrate that inactivating bilateral rmCD through activation of hM4Di produces a significant and reproducible loss of sensitivity to reward value in monkeys. Thus, the rmCD is involved in making normal judgments about the value of reward. Processing the value of reward is thought to involve the rostromedial caudate (rmCD), but a causal demonstration is lacking in primates. Here the authors use chemogenetics and PET imaging to show that inactivation of rmCD leads to impairments in reward value judgments.",Nature communications,NEURO
0.694740074,30781612,Improvement of Asphalt-Aggregate Adhesion Using Plant Ash Byproduct,"The adhesion bonding between asphalt and aggregate significantly influences field performance and durability of asphalt pavement. Adhesion promoters are typically used to improve asphalt-aggregate bonding and minimize moisture-related pavement damage, such as cracking and raveling. This study evaluated the effectiveness of plant ash byproduct as adhesion promoter to improve asphalt-aggregate adhesion performance. Three commonly used aggregate types (granite, basic rock, and limestone) and two asphalt binder types were used in laboratory testing. A modified stripping test method was developed to evaluate test results with image analysis and measurement of asphalt film thickness. The contact angle test and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) were conducted. Test results showed that plant ash lixivium significantly improved asphalt-aggregate adhesion. Among three aggregate types, granite yielded the worst asphalt-aggregate adhesion for both control and treated specimens. The effectiveness of adhesion promotion varied depending on the type of asphalt or aggregate and temperature. The SEM/EDS observations showed that the mesh-like crystalline was formed at the interface between asphalt binder and aggregate in the treated specimen, which was believed to enhance the interfacial bonding and prevent asphalt film peeling off from aggregate.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",CHEM

However, the contribution of RTE activity to aging and age-associated diseases is not known. Here we show that during cellular senescence LINE-1 elements (L1s) become transcriptionally derepressed and activate a type-I interferon (IFN-I) response. The IFN-I response is a novel phenotype of late senescence and contributes to the maintenance of the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The IFN-I response is triggered by cytoplasmic L1 cDNA, and is antagonized by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that inhibit the L1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Treatment of aged mice with the NRTI lamivudine downregulated IFN-I activation and age-associated inflammation in several tissues. We propose that RTE activation is an important component of sterile inflammation that is a hallmark of aging, and that L1 RT is a relevant target for the treatment of age-associated disorders.

0.484674,24056031,Mitochondrial glutathione depletion reveals a novel role for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex as a key H 2 O 2  emitting source under conditions of nutrient overload," Once regarded as ‚Äúbyproducts‚Äù of aerobic metabolism, the production of superoxide/H 2 O 2 is now understood to be a highly specialized and extensively regulated process responsible for exerting control over a vast number of thiol-containing proteins, collectively referred to as the redox-sensitive proteome. Although disruptions within this process, secondary to elevated peroxide exposure, have been linked to disease, delineation of the sources and mechanisms regulating increased peroxide burden remain poorly defined and as such difficult to target using pharmacotherapy. Here we identify the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) as a key source of H 2 O 2 within skeletal muscle mitochondria under conditions of depressed glutathione redox buffering integrity. Treatment of permeabilized myofibers with varying concentrations of the glutathione depleting agent 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) led to a dose-dependent increase in pyruvate-supported J H 2 O 2 emission, with emission rates eventually rising to exceed those of all substrate combinations tested. This striking sensitivity to glutathione depletion was observed in permeabilized fibers prepared from multiple species and was specific to PDC. Physiological oxidation of the cellular glutathione pool following high fat feeding in rodents was found to elevate PDC J H 2 O 2 emission, as well as increase the sensitivity of the complex to GSH depletion. These findings reveal PDC as a potential major site of H 2 O 2 production that is extremely sensitive to mitochondrial glutathione redox status. ",Free radical biology & medicine,BIOCHEM

The AP2/ERF transcription factor family has been identified in many plants, and several AP2/ERF transcription factors from Arabidopsis thaliana ( A. thaliana ) have been functionally characterized. However, little research has been conducted on the AP2/ERF genes of tartary buckwheat ( Fagopyum tataricum ), which is an important edible and medicinal crop. The recently published whole genome sequence of tartary buckwheat allowed us to study the tissue and expression profiles of AP2/ERF genes in tartary buckwheat on a genome-wide basis. Results In this study, 134 AP2/ERF genes of tartary buckwheat ( FtAP2/ERF ) were identified and renamed according to the chromosomal distribution of the FtAP2/ERF genes. According to the number conserved domains and gene structure, the AP2/ERF genes were divided into three subfamilies by phylogenetic tree analysis, namely, AP2 (15 members), ERF (116 members) and RAV (3 members). A total of 10 motifs were detected in tartary buckwheat AP2/ERF genes, and some of the unique motifs were found to be important for the function of AP2/ERF genes. Conclusion A comprehensive analysis of AP2/ERF gene expression patterns in different tissues and fruit development stages by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that they played an important role in the growth and development of tartary buckwheat, and genes that might regulate flower and fruit development were preliminarily identified.

0.546005831,22291668,Self-Assessment of Individual Differences in Language Switching,"Language switching is omnipresent in bilingual individuals. In fact, the ability to switch languages (code switching) is a very fast, efficient, and flexible process that seems to be a fundamental aspect of bilingual language processing. In this study, we aimed to characterize psychometrically self-perceived individual differences in language switching and to create a reliable measure of this behavioral pattern by introducing a bilingual switching questionnaire. As a working hypothesis based on the previous literature about code switching, we decomposed language switching into four constructs: (i) L1 switching tendencies (the tendency to switch to L1; L1-switch); (ii) L2 switching tendencies (L2-switch); (iii) contextual switch, which indexes the frequency of switches usually triggered by a particular situation, topic, or environment; and (iv) unintended switch, which measures the lack of intention and awareness of the language switches. A total of 582 Spanish‚ÄìCatalan bilingual university students were studied. Twelve items were selected (three for each construct). The correlation matrix was factor-analyzed using minimum rank factor analysis followed by oblique direct oblimin rotation. The overall proportion of common variance explained by the four extracted factors was 0.86. Finally, to assess the external validity of the individual differences scored with the new questionnaire, we evaluated the correlations between these measures and several psychometric (language proficiency) and behavioral measures related to cognitive and attentional control.

Objectives Research questions were: 1) How well does the WURSS-21 assess the symptoms and functional impairments associated with common cold? 2) How well can this instrument measure change over time (responsiveness)? 3) What is the minimal important difference (MID) that can be detected by the WURSS-21? 4) What are the descriptive statistics for area under the time severity curve (AUC)? 5) What sample sizes would trials require to detect MID or AUC criteria? 6) What does factor analysis tell us about the underlying dimensional structure of the common cold? 7) How reliable are items, domains, and summary scores represented in WURSS? 8) For each of these considerations, how well does the WURSS-21 compare to the WURSS-44, Jackson, and SF-8? Study Design and Setting People with Jackson-defined colds were recruited from the community in and around Madison, Wisconsin. Participants were enrolled within 48 hours of first cold symptom and monitored for up to 14 days of illness. Half the sample filled out the WURSS-21 in the morning and the WURSS-44 in the evening, with the other half reversing the daily order. External comparators were the SF-8, a 24-hour recall general health measure yielding separate physical and mental health scores, and the eight-item Jackson cold index, which assesses symptoms, but not functional impairment or quality of life. Results In all, 230 participants were monitored for 2,457 person-days. Participants were aged 14 to 83 years (mean 34.1, SD 13.6), majority female (66.5%), mostly white (86.0%), and represented substantive education and income diversity. WURSS-21 items demonstrated similar performance when embedded within the WURSS-44 or in the stand-alone WURSS-21. Minimal important difference (MID) and Guyatt's responsiveness index were 10.3, 0.71 for the WURSS-21 and 18.5, 0.75 for the WURSS-44. Factorial analysis suggested an eight dimension structure for the WURSS-44 and a three dimension structure for the WURSS-21, with composite reliability coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.97, and Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.76 to 0.96. Both WURSS versions correlated significantly with the Jackson scale (W-21 R = 0.85; W-44 R = 0.88), with the SF-8 physical health (W-21 R = -0.79; W-44 R = -0.80) and SF-8 mental health (W-21 R = -0.55; W-44 R = -0.60). Conclusion The WURSS-44 and WURSS-21 perform well as illness-specific quality-of-life evaluative outcome instruments. Construct validity is supported by the data presented here. While the WURSS-44 covers more symptoms, the WURSS-21 exhibits similar performance in terms of reliability, responsiveness, importance-to-patients, and convergence with other measures.",Health and quality of life outcomes,CLINIC

Thus, it is important to characterize BPA levels, metabolic fate and sources of exposure in pregnant women. Methods We used an improved liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analytic method to directly and simultaneously measure unconjugated BPA (uBPA), BPA glucuronide and BPA sulfate in the urine of a population of ethnically and racially diverse, and predominately low-income pregnant women ( n =‚Äâ112) in their second trimester. We also administered a questionnaire on dietary and non-dietary sources of exposure to BPA. Results We found universal and high exposure to uBPA and its metabolites: median concentrations were 0.25, 4.67, and 0.31¬†Œºg/g creatinine for uBPA, BPA glucuronide, and BPA sulfate, respectively. The median Total BPA (uBPA‚Äâ+‚ÄâBPA in glucuronide and sulfate forms) level was more than twice that measured in U.S. pregnant women in NHANES 2005‚Äì2006, while 30¬†% of the women had Total BPA levels above the 95th percentile. On average, Total BPA consisted of 71¬†% BPA in glucuronide form, 15¬†% BPA in sulfate form and 14¬†% uBPA, however the proportion of BPA in sulfate form increased and the proportion of uBPA decreased with Total BPA levels. Occupational and non-occupational contact with paper receipts was positively associated with BPA in conjugated (glucuronidated‚Äâ+‚Äâsulfated) form after adjustment for demographic characteristics. Recent consumption of foods and beverages likely to be contaminated with BPA was infrequent among participants and we did not observe any positive associations with BPA analyte levels. Conclusion The high levels of BPA analytes found in our study population may be attributable to the low-income status of the majority of participants and/or our direct analytic method, which yields a more complete evaluation of BPA exposure. We observed near-universal exposure to BPA among pregnant women, as well as substantial variability in BPA metabolic clearance, raising additional concerns for effects on fetal development. Our results are consistent with studies showing thermal paper receipts to be an important source of exposure, point to the difficulty pregnant women have avoiding BPA exposure on an individual level, and therefore underscore the need for changes in BPA regulation and commerce.

0.055153044,30192394,Dietary macronutrient composition determines the contribution of DGAT1 to alcoholic steatosis,"  Background:  The first stage of alcoholic liver disease is hepatic steatosis. While alcohol is known to profoundly impact hepatic lipid metabolism, gaps in our knowledge remain regarding the mechanisms leading to alcohol-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. As the sole enzymes catalyzing the final step in triglyceride synthesis, Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase (DGAT) 1 and 2 are potentially important contributors to alcoholic steatosis. Our goal was to study the effects of dietary fat content on alcohol-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, and the relative contribution of DGAT1 and DGAT2 to alcoholic steatosis.    Methods:  These studies were carried out in wild-type mice fed alcohol-containing high-fat or low-fat formulations of Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets, as well as follow-up studies in Dgat1 ‚àí/‚àí mice.    Results:  A direct comparison of the low-fat and high-fat liquid diet in wild-type mice revealed surprisingly similar levels of alcoholic steatosis, although there were underlying differences in the pattern of hepatic lipid accumulation and expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. Follow-up studies in Dgat1 ‚àí/‚àí mice revealed that these animals are protected from alcoholic steatosis when consumed as part of a high-fat diet, but not a low-fat diet.    Conclusions:  dietary macronutrient composition influences the relative contribution of DGAT1 and DGAT2 to alcoholic steatosis, such that in the context of alcohol and a high-fat diet, DGAT1 predominates.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of host control of bnAb induction is critical to vaccine design. Here, we performed a transcriptome analysis of blood mononuclear cells from 47 HIV-1-infected individuals who made bnAbs and 46 HIV-1-infected individuals who did not and identified in bnAb individuals upregulation of RAB11FIP5 , encoding a Rab effector protein associated with recycling endosomes. Natural killer (NK) cells had the highest differential expression of RAB11FIP5 , which was associated with greater dysregulation of NK cell subsets in bnAb subjects. NK cells from bnAb individuals had a more adaptive/dysfunctional phenotype and exhibited impaired degranulation and cytokine production that correlated with RAB11FIP5 transcript levels. Moreover, RAB11FIP5 overexpression modulated the function of NK cells. These data suggest that¬†NK cells and Rab11 recycling endosomal transport are involved in regulation of HIV-1 bnAb development.

0.960237456,22346736,"Prevalence, Distribution, and Impact of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Latin America, China, and India: A 10/66 Population-Based Study","A set of cross-sectional surveys carried out in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, China, and India reveal the prevalence and between-country variation in mild cognitive impairment at a population level. Background Rapid demographic ageing is a growing public health issue in many low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a construct frequently used to define groups of people who may be at risk of developing dementia, crucial for targeting preventative interventions. However, little is known about the prevalence or impact of MCI in LAMIC settings. Methods and Findings Data were analysed from cross-sectional surveys established by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group and carried out in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, China, and India on 15,376 individuals aged 65+ without dementia. Standardised assessments of mental and physical health, and cognitive function were carried out including informant interviews. An algorithm was developed to define Mayo Clinic amnestic MCI (aMCI). Disability (12-item World Health Organization disability assessment schedule [WHODAS]) and informant-reported neuropsychiatric symptoms (neuropsychiatric inventory [NPI-Q]) were measured. After adjustment, aMCI was associated with disability, anxiety, apathy, and irritability (but not depression); between-country heterogeneity in these associations was only significant for disability. The crude prevalence of aMCI ranged from 0.8% in China to 4.3% in India. Country differences changed little (range 0.6%‚Äì4.6%) after standardization for age, gender, and education level. In pooled estimates, aMCI was modestly associated with male gender and fewer assets but was not associated with age or education. There was no significant between-country variation in these demographic associations. Conclusions An algorithm-derived diagnosis of aMCI showed few sociodemographic associations but was consistently associated with higher disability and neuropsychiatric symptoms in addition to showing substantial variation in prevalence across LAMIC populations. Longitudinal data are needed to confirm findings‚Äîin particular, to investigate the predictive validity of aMCI in these settings and risk/protective factors for progression to dementia; however, the large number affected has important implications in these rapidly ageing settings.  Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary  Editors' Summary Background Currently, more than 35 million people worldwide have dementia, a group of brain disorders characterized by an irreversible decline in memory, problem solving, communication, and other ‚Äúcognitive‚Äù functions. Dementia, the commonest form of which is Alzheimer's disease, mainly affects older people and, because more people than ever are living to a ripe old age, experts estimate that, by 2050, more than 115 million people will have dementia. At present, there is no cure for dementia although drugs can be used to manage some of the symptoms. Risk factors for dementia include physical inactivity, infrequent participation in mentally or socially stimulating activities, and common vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. In addition, some studies have reported that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with an increased risk of dementia. MCI can be seen as an intermediate state between normal cognitive aging (becoming increasingly forgetful) and dementia although many people with MCI never develop dementia, and some types of MCI can be static or self-limiting. Individuals with MCI have cognitive problems that are more severe than those normally seen in people of a similar age but they have no other symptoms of dementia and are able to look after themselves. The best studied form of MCI‚Äîamnestic MCI (aMCI)‚Äîis characterized by memory problems such as misplacing things and forgetting appointments. Why Was This Study Done? Much of the expected increase in dementia will occur in low and middle income countries (LAMICs) because these countries have rapidly aging populations. Given that aMCI is frequently used to define groups of people who may be at risk of developing dementia, it would be useful to know what proportion of community-dwelling older adults in LAMICs have aMCI (the prevalence of aMCI). Such information might help governments plan their future health care and social support needs. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, the researchers estimate the prevalence of aMCI in eight LAMICs using data collected by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group. They also investigate the association of aMCI with sociodemographic factors (for example, age, gender, and education), disability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, apathy, irritability, and depression. A cross-sectional study collects data on a population at a single time point; the 10/66 Dementia Research Group is building an evidence base to inform the development and implementation of policies for improving the health and social welfare of older people in LAMICs, particularly people with dementia. What Did the Researchers Do and Find? In cross-sectional surveys carried out in six Latin American LAMICS, China, and India, more than 15,000 elderly individuals without dementia completed standardized assessments of their mental and physical health and their cognitive function. Interviews with relatives and carers provided further details about the participant's cognitive decline and about neuropsychiatric symptoms. The researchers developed an algorithm (set of formulae) that used the data collected in these surveys to diagnose aMCI in the study participants. Finally, they used statistical methods to analyze the prevalence, distribution, and impact of aMCI in the eight LAMICs. The researchers report that aMCI was associated with disability, anxiety, apathy, and irritability but not with depression and that the prevalence of aMCI ranged from 0.8% in China to 4.3% in India. Other analyses show that, considered across all eight countries, aMCI was modestly associated with being male (men had a slightly higher prevalence of aMCI than women) and with having fewer assets but was not associated with age or education. What Do These Findings Mean? These findings suggest that aMCI, as diagnosed using the algorithm developed by the researchers, is consistently associated with higher disability and with neuropsychiatric symptoms in the LAMICs studied but not with most sociodemographic factors. Because prevalidated and standardized measurements were applied consistently in all the countries and a common algorithm was used to define aMCI, these findings also suggest that the prevalence of aMCI varies markedly among LAMIC populations and is similar to or slightly lower than the prevalence most often reported for European and North American populations. Although longitudinal studies are now needed to investigate the extent to which aMCI can be used as risk marker for further cognitive decline and dementia in these settings, the large absolute numbers of older people with aMCI in LAMICs revealed here potentially has important implications for health care and social service planning in these rapidly aging and populous regions of the world.

Brain microRNAs (miRNA) relating to clinical features of HD may represent a potential HD biomarker in blood.    Objective  Examine candidate miRNAs in plasma to determine if changes observed in HD brains are detectable in peripheral samples.    Methods  Four miRNA from 26 manifest HD, 4 asymptomatic HD gene carriers and 8 controls were quantified in plasma using RT-qPCR.

0.765563889,23802663,Sex Differences in the Cholinergic Basal Forebrain in the Ts65Dn Mouse Model of Down Syndrome and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease," In the Down syndrome (DS) population, there is an early incidence of dementia and neuropathology similar to that seen in sporadic Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), including dysfunction of the basal forebrain cholinergic neuron (BFCN) system. Using Ts65Dn mice, a model of DS and AD, we examined differences in the BFCN system between male and female segmentally trisomic (Ts65Dn) and disomic (2N) mice at ages 5‚Äì8 months. Quantitative stereology was applied to BFCN subfields immunolabeled for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) within the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band (MS/VDB), horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB) and nucleus basalis of Meynert/ substantia innominata (NBM/SI). We found no sex differences in neuron number or subregion area measurement in the MS/VDB or HDB. However, 2N and Ts65Dn females showed an average 34% decrease in BFCN number and an average 20% smaller NBM/SI region area compared with genotype-matched males. Further, relative to genotype-matched males, female mice had smaller BFCNs in all subregions. These findings demonstrate that differences between the sexes in BFCNs of young adult Ts65Dn and 2N mice are region and genotype specific. In addition, changes in post-processing tissue thickness suggest altered parenchymal characteristics between male and female Ts65Dn mice. ","Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",NEURO
0.759017204,27437579,A multi-modal parcellation of human cerebral cortex," Understanding the amazingly complex human cerebral cortex requires a map (or parcellation) of its major subdivisions, known as cortical areas. Making an accurate areal map has been a century-old objective in neuroscience. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance images from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and an objective semi-automated neuroanatomical approach, we delineated 180 areas per hemisphere bounded by sharp changes in cortical architecture, function, connectivity, and/or topography in a precisely aligned group average of 210 healthy young adults. We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in new HCP subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize the multi-modal ‚Äòfingerprint‚Äô of each cortical area. This classifier detected the presence of 96.6% of the cortical areas in new subjects, replicated the group parcellation, and could correctly locate areas in individuals with atypical parcellations. The freely available parcellation and classifier will enable substantially improved neuroanatomical precision for studies of the structural and functional organization of human cerebral cortex and its variation across individuals and in development, aging, and disease.

In this study we compared the active sites of monomers and tetramers of human BChE and human AChE after performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in water-solvated systems. By comparing the conformational dynamics of gating residues of AChE and BChE, we found that the gating mechanisms of the main door of AChE and BChE are responsible for their different substrate specificities. Our simulation of the tetramers of AChE and BChE indicates that both enzymes could have two dysfunctional active sites due to their restricted accessibility to substrates. The further study on catalytic mechanisms of multiple forms of AChE and BChE would benefit from our comparison of the active sites of the monomers and tetramers of both enzymes.

Most of the data supporting these theories stem from animal research, particularly lesion studies. The generalisation of findings from rodent models to human function is hampered by fundamental inter-species differences. The present work uses a task of spatial orientation, which is known to rely on hippocampal function. Deficits in spatial navigation in anxious children suggest that the hippocampal network involved in spatial orientation is also implicated in anxiety disorders.

0.8224982,27364770,MNK Inhibition Disrupts Mesenchymal Glioma Stem Cells and Prolongs Survival in a Mouse Model of Glioblastoma," Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains the deadliest malignant brain tumor, with glioma stem cells (GSCs) contributing to treatment resistance and tumor recurrence. We have identified MAPK-interacting kinases (MNKs) as potential targets for the GSC population in GBM. Isoform-level subtyping using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that both MNK genes (MKNK1 and MKNK2) are upregulated in mesenchymal GBM as compared to other subtypes. Expression of MKNK1 is associated with increased glioma grade and correlated with the mesenchymal GSC marker, CD44; and co-expression of MKNK1 and CD44 predicts poor survival in GBM. In established and patient-derived cell lines, pharmacological MNK inhibition using LY2801653 (merestinib) inhibited phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a crucial effector for MNK induced mRNA translation in cancer cells and a marker of transformation. Importantly, merestinib inhibited growth of GSCs grown as neurospheres as determined by extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA). When the effects of merestinib were assessed in vivo using an intracranial xenograft mouse model, improved overall survival was observed in merestinib-treated mice. Taken together, these data provide strong preclinical evidence that pharmacological MNK inhibition targets mesenchymal GBM and its GSC population.   Implications  These findings raise the possibility of MNK inhibition as a viable therapeutic approach to target the mesenchymal subtype of GBM.  ",Molecular cancer research : MCR,ONCO
0.397101395,28188144,Elevated Rate of Genome Rearrangements in Radiation-Resistant Bacteria,"A number of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic species are known for their resistance to ionizing radiation. One of the challenges these species face is a potent environmental source of DNA double-strand breaks, potential drivers of genome structure evolution. Efficient and accurate DNA double-strand break repair systems have been demonstrated in several unrelated radiation-resistant species and are putative adaptations to the DNA damaging environment. Such adaptations are expected to compensate for the genome-destabilizing effect of environmental DNA damage and may be expected to result in a more conserved gene order in radiation-resistant species. However, here we show that rates of genome rearrangements, measured as loss of gene order conservation with time, are higher in radiation-resistant species in multiple, phylogenetically independent groups of bacteria. Comparison of indicators of selection for genome organization between radiation-resistant and phylogenetically matched, nonresistant species argues against tolerance to disruption of genome structure as a strategy for radiation resistance. Interestingly, an important mechanism affecting genome rearrangements in prokaryotes, the symmetrical inversions around the origin of DNA replication, shapes genome structure of both radiation-resistant and nonresistant species. In conclusion, the opposing effects of environmental DNA damage and DNA repair result in elevated rates of genome rearrangements in radiation-resistant bacteria.",Genetics,BIOCHEM

0.303771113,30014590,The profile of abstract rule learning in infancy: Meta-analytic and experimental evidence," Everyone agrees that infants possess general mechanisms for learning about the world, but the existence and operation of more specialized mechanisms is controversial. One mechanism ‚Äì rule learning ‚Äì has been proposed as potentially specific to speech, based on findings that 7-month-olds can learn abstract repetition rules from spoken syllables (e.g., ABB patterns: wo-fe-fe, ga-tu-tu ‚Ä¶) but not from closely matched stimuli, such as tones. Subsequent work has shown that learning of abstract patterns is not simply specific to speech. However, we still lack a parsimonious explanation to tie together the diverse, messy, and occasionally contradictory findings in that literature. We took two routes to creating a new profile of rule learning: meta-analysis of 20 prior reports on infants‚Äô learning of abstract repetition rules (including 1,318 infants in 63 experiments total), and an experiment on learning of such rules from a natural, non-speech communicative signal. These complementary approaches revealed that infants were most likely to learn abstract patterns from meaningful stimuli. We argue that the ability to detect and generalize simple patterns supports learning across domains in infancy but chiefly when the signal is meaningfully relevant to infants‚Äô experience with sounds, objects, language, and people.

0.12910497,29626740,The relationship between impulsivity and methamphetamine use severity in a community sample,"  Background:  Abuse of psychostimulants, including methamphetamine (MA), has been linked to heightened impulsivity. While previous research has demonstrated differences in impulsivity between MA users and non-substance users, less is known about variability in impulsivity within MA users and whether the severity of MA use related problems predicts impulsivity within individuals who regularly use MA. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between impulsivity and MA use severity.    Method:  Non-treatment seeking individuals who reported regular MA use (n = 177) completed an impulsivity battery comprising self-report and behavioral measures. A structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to test the relationship between the MA use related problem severity and measures of impulsivity.    Results:  The final SEM model of impulsivity and MA use related problems (CFI= 0.897, RMSEA= 0.059, S-B scaled œá 2 [260, n = 103] = 406.86) revealed that greater MA use severity was associated with greater self-reported impulsiveness, but no relationship was found between MA use severity and behavioral measures of impulsivity.    Conclusions:  The current findings extend previous research by providing additional evidence that MA use is associated with increased self-reported impulsivity and highlights the importance of evaluating impulsivity as a multidimensional construct.

0.973900205,26136668,Optimal hemodynamic response model for functional near-infrared spectroscopy,"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging non-invasive brain imaging technique and measures brain activities by means of near-infrared light of 650‚Äì950 nm wavelengths. The cortical hemodynamic response (HR) differs in attributes at different brain regions and on repetition of trials, even if the experimental paradigm is kept exactly the same. Therefore, an HR model that can estimate such variations in the response is the objective of this research. The canonical hemodynamic response function (cHRF) is modeled by two Gamma functions with six unknown parameters (four of them to model the shape and other two to scale and baseline respectively). The HRF model is supposed to be a linear combination of HRF, baseline, and physiological noises (amplitudes and frequencies of physiological noises are supposed to be unknown). An objective function is developed as a square of the residuals with constraints on 12 free parameters. The formulated problem is solved by using an iterative optimization algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters in the model. Inter-subject variations in HRF and physiological noises have been estimated for better cortical functional maps. The accuracy of the algorithm has been verified using 10 real and 15 simulated data sets. Ten healthy subjects participated in the experiment and their HRF for finger-tapping tasks have been estimated and analyzed. The statistical significance of the estimated activity strength parameters has been verified by employing statistical analysis (i.e., t -value > t critical and p -value < 0.05).",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,NEURO

In this manuscript, we survey the process of testing bioequivalence and advocate the likelihood paradigm for representing the resulting data as evidence. We emphasize the unique conflicts between hypothesis testing and confidence intervals in this area - which we believe are indicative of the existence of the systemic defects in the frequentist approach - that the likelihood paradigm avoids. We suggest the direct use of profile likelihoods for evaluating bioequivalence. We discuss how the likelihood approach is useful to present the evidence for both average and population bioequivalence within a unified framework. We also examine the main properties of profile likelihoods and estimated likelihoods under simulation. This simulation study shows that profile likelihoods offer a viable alternative to the (unknown) true likelihood for a range of parameters commensurate with bioequivalence research.

In a recent study, comparing various analytical ultracentrifuges, we have shown that external calibration of the scan time, radial magnification, and temperature are critically important for accurate measurements (Anal. Biochem., 2013, doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2013.05.011). To achieve accurate temperature calibration, we have introduced the use of an autonomous miniature temperature logging integrated circuit (Maxim Thermochron iButton ‚Ñ¢ ) that can be inserted in an ultracentrifugation cell assembly and spun at low rotor speeds. In the present work, we developed an improved holder for the temperature sensor located in the rotor handle. This has the advantage of not reducing the rotor capacity and allows for a direct temperature measurement of the spinning rotor during high-speed sedimentation velocity experiments up to 60,000 rpm. We demonstrate the sensitivity of this approach by monitoring the adiabatic cooling due to rotor stretching during rotor acceleration, and the reverse process upon rotor deceleration. Based on this, we developed a procedure to approximate isothermal rotor acceleration for better temperature control. ",Analytical biochemistry,BIOCHEM

ONC201 is a first-in-class small molecule that activates p53-independent apoptosis, has a benign safety profile, and is in early clinical trials. We found that ONC201 caused p53-independent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cell lines and in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples from patients; these included samples from patients with genetic abnormalities associated with poor prognosis or cells that had developed resistance to the nongenotoxic agents ibrutinib and bortezomib. Moreover, ONC201 caused apoptosis in stem and progenitor AML cells and abrogated the engraftment of leukemic stem cells in mice while sparing normal bone marrow cells. ONC201 caused changes in gene expression similar to those caused by the unfolded protein response (UPR) and integrated stress responses (ISRs), which increase the translation of the transcription factor ATF4 through an increase in the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2Œ±. However, unlike the UPR and ISR, the increase in ATF4 abundance in ONC201-treated hematopoietic cells promoted apoptosis and did not depend on increased phosphorylation of eIF2Œ±. ONC201 also inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, likely through ATF4-mediated induction of the mTORC1 inhibitor DDIT4. Overexpression of BCL-2 protected against ONC201-induced apoptosis, and the combination of ONC201 and the BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199 synergistically increased apoptosis. Thus, our results suggest that by inducing an atypical ISR and p53-independent apoptosis, ONC201 has clinical potential in hematological malignancies. ",Science signaling,BIOCHEM

By using whole genome sequencing of pools of individuals (Pool-Seq), this method can identify selected variants in controlled and replicable experimental settings. Reviewing the current state of the field, we show that E&R can be powerful enough to identify causative genes and possibly even single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We also discuss how the experimental design and the complexity of the trait could result in a large number of false positive candidates. We suggest experimental and analytical strategies to maximize the power of E&R to uncover the genotype‚Äìphenotype link and serve as an important research tool for a broad range of evolutionary questions.",Heredity,ECO
0.994936897,30783411,QT interval and P wave dispersion in slow coronary flow phenomenon,"BACKGROUND Slow coronary flow (SCF) phenomenon is an angiographic finding which is defined as slow contrast passage through coronary arteries which may predispose patients to serious cardiac complications such as fatal arrhythmias. P-wave and QT-interval dispersion are electrocardiographic findings which are related to atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In the present study, the relation between SCF and presence of P-wave and QT-interval dispersion in electrocardiography has been evaluated. METHODS 47 patients with normal coronary arteries and SCF and 40 patients with normal coronary artery flow without SCF were enrolled in this case control study. Standard electrocardiogram (ECG) was analyzed for P-wave and QT-interval dispersion. SCF was identified in normal coronary vessels by use of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) frame count (TFC) method (TFC > 27). Corrected TIMI frame count (CTFC) of coronary vessels as well as mean CTFC along with QT-interval and P-wave dispersion were compared between 2 groups. The study data were analyzed by SPSS software and P value less than 0.050 was considered to be significant. RESULTS QT-interval [76.17 (35.23) ms versus 39.25 (19.26) ms] and P-wave [39.74 (17.48) ms versus 19.50 (8.54) ms] dispersion were significantly higher among patients with SCF phenomenon (P < 0.050). In addition, there was a positive significant linear correlation between TFC and P-wave and QT-dispersion (r = 0.857, r = 0.861, respectively, P < 0.050). CONCLUSION According to the results, increasing TFC among patients with SCF will result in P wave and QT interval dispersion and therefore this finding can be considered as an indicative marker for cardiac events.",ARYA atherosclerosis,CLINIC
0.151974013,26168793,The neural basis of the imitation drive,"Spontaneous imitation is assumed to underlie the acquisition of important skills by infants, including language and social interaction. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the neural basis of ‚Äòspontaneously‚Äô driven imitation, which has not yet been fully investigated. Healthy participants were presented with movie clips of meaningless bimanual actions and instructed to observe and imitate them during an fMRI scan. The participants were subsequently shown the movie clips again and asked to evaluate the strength of their ‚Äòurge to imitate‚Äô (Urge) for each action. We searched for cortical areas where the degree of activation positively correlated with Urge scores; significant positive correlations were observed in the right supplementary motor area (SMA) and bilateral midcingulate cortex (MCC) under the imitation condition. These areas were not explained by explicit reasons for imitation or the kinematic characteristics of the actions. Previous studies performed in monkeys and humans have implicated the SMA and MCC/caudal cingulate zone in voluntary actions. This study also confirmed the functional connectivity between Urge and imitation performance using a psychophysiological interaction analysis. Thus, our findings reveal the critical neural components that underlie spontaneous imitation and provide possible reasons why infants imitate spontaneously.",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,NEURO
0.9051116,17286805,Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is required for functioning of the adaptor protein Sla1p in endocytosis," Summary  Dual localisation of proteins at the plasma membrane and within the nucleus have been reported in mammalian cells. Among these proteins are those involved in cell adhesion structures and in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In the case of endocytic proteins, trafficking to the nucleus is not known to play a role in their endocytic function. Here we show localisation of the yeast endocytic adaptor protein Sla1p to the nucleus as well as to the cell cortex and we demonstrate the importance of specific regions of Sla1p for this nuclear localisation. A role for specific karyopherins (importins and exportins) in Sla1p nuclear localisation is revealed. Furthermore, endocytosis of Sla1p-dependent cargo is defective in three strains with karyopherin mutations. Finally, we investigate possible functions for nuclear trafficking of endocytic proteins. Our data reveal for the first time that nuclear transport of endocytic proteins is important for functional endocytosis in S.cerevisiae . We determine the mechanism, involving an Œ±/Œ≤ importin pair, that facilitates uptake of Sla1p and demonstrate that nuclear transport is required for the functioning of Sla1p during endocytosis.

However, few researchers have studied the functional structure changes of the eight resting state networks (RSNs) in ASD patients. Therefore, research on statistical differences of RSNs between 42 healthy controls (HC) and 50 ASD patients has been studied using linear independent component analysis (ICA) in this paper. Our researches showed that there was abnormal functional connectivity (FC) of RSNs in ASD patients. The RSNs with the decreased FC and increased FC in ASD patients included default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN), core network (CN), visual network (VN), self-referential network (SRN) compared to HC. The RSNs with the increased FC in ASD patients included auditory network (AN), somato-motor network (SMN). The dorsal attention network (DAN) in ASD patients showed the decreased FC. Our findings indicate that the abnormal FC in RSNs extensively exists in ASD patients.

0.745436734,15356073,STUDIES ON THE ORIGIN OF CIRCULATING 18-HYDROXYCORTISOL AND 18-OXOCORTISOL IN NORMAL HUMAN SUBJECTS.," 18-hydroxycortisol (18-OHF) and 18-oxocortisol (18oxo-F) are derivatives of cortisol found in Primary Aldosteronism but whose origin and regulation in normal subjects is uncertain. 18-OHF can be synthesised by zona fasciculata 11-Œ≤ hydroxylase; 18-oxoF can only be produced by zona glomerulosa aldosterone synthase (AS). Stably transfected cell lines expressing either CYP11B1 (11Œ≤-hydroxylase) or CYP11B2 (AS) were incubated with cortisol and other substrates over a range of concentrations. Both enzymes could synthesise 18-OHF from cortisol but only AS could synthesise 18-oxoF. AS was more efficient than 11Œ≤-hydroxylase at 18-hydroxylation. The apparent Km of AS for cortisol was estimated to be 2.6ŒºM. In 5 patients with adrenal insufficiency maintained on hydrocortisone, urinary free cortisol and cortisone levels were high; 18-oxoF was detectable in all patients and 18-hydroxycortisol in 3. It is likely that the 18-oxygenated steroids were synthesised from circulating cortisol, either in the zona glomerulosa or at extra-adrenal sites. In 8 male volunteers, dexamethasone treatment decreased urinary excretion rates of free cortisol, cortisone, 18-OHF and 18-oxoFl, confirming dependence of 18-oxygenated steroid levels on cortisol availability. In both groups, hydrocortisone administration resulted in detectable levels of 18-OHF and raised levels of 18-oxoF. There was close correlation between 18-oxoF and cortisol excretion during hydrocortisone administration in normal subjects (r=0.86, p<0.001).  These data show, for the first time, that 18-OHF and 18oxoF can be synthesised from circulating cortisol. The close correlation between 18-oxoF and cortisol suggests that 18-oxoF is normally produced by the action of aldosterone synthase utilising circulating cortisol as a substrate. Although 18OHF can be synthesized using circulating cortisol as substrate, our data suggest this is normally produced in the zona fasciculata by 11Œ≤-hydroxylase from locally available cortisol.

With the rapid development of high-throughput ‚Äúomics‚Äù technologies, the achieved ability to detect and characterize molecules with other molecule targets opens the possibility of investigating the relationships between different molecules from a global perspective. In this article, a molecular association network (MAN) is constructed and comprehensively analyzed by integrating the associations among miRNA, lncRNA, protein, drug, and disease, in which any kind of potential associations can be predicted. More specifically, each node in MAN can be represented as a vector by combining two kinds of information including the attribute of the node itself (e.g., sequences of ncRNAs and proteins, semantics of diseases and molecular fingerprints of drugs) and the behavior of the node in the complex network (associations with other nodes). A random forest classifier is trained to classify and predict new interactions or associations between biomolecules. In the experiment, the proposed method achieved a superb performance with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.9735 under a five-fold cross-validation, which showed that the proposed method could provide new insight for exploration of the molecular mechanisms of disease and valuable clues for disease treatment.",Cells,BIOCHEM
0.971375297,21432692,The unconscious pursuit of emotion regulation: Implications for psychological health," Because of the central involvement of emotion regulation in psychological health and the role that implicit (largely unconscious) processes appear to play in emotion regulation, implicit emotion-regulatory processes should play a vital role in psychological health. We hypothesised that implicitly valuing emotion regulation translates into better psychological health in individuals who use adaptive emotion-regulation strategies. A community sample of 222 individuals (56% women) who had recently experienced a stressful life event completed an implicit measure of emotion regulation valuing (ER-IAT) and reported on their habitual use of an important adaptive emotion-regulation strategy: cognitive reappraisal. We measured three domains of psychological health: well-being, depressive symptoms, and social adjustment. As hypothesised, individuals who implicitly valued emotion regulation exhibited greater levels of psychological health, but only when they were high in cognitive reappraisal use. These findings suggest that salutary effects of unconscious emotion-regulation processes depend on its interplay with conscious emotion-regulation processes. ",Cognition & emotion,PSYCH
0.591849199,26855824,A Prototype for a Hybrid System to Support Systematic Review Teams: A Case Study of Organ Transplantation," We describe a prototype for a hybrid system designed to reduce the number of citations needed to re-screen (NNRS) by systematic reviewers, where citations include titles, abstracts, and metadata. The system obviates the need for screening the entire set of citations a second time, which is typically done to control human error. The reference set is based on a complex review about organ transplantation (N=10,796 citations). Data were split into 50% training and test sets, randomly stratified for percentage eligible citations. The system consists of a rule-based module and a machine-learning (ML) module. The former substantially reduces the number of negative citations passed to the ML module and improves imbalance. Relative to the baseline, the system reduces classification error (5.6% vs 2.9%) thereby reducing NNRS by 47.3% (300 vs 158). We discuss the implications of de-emphasizing sensitivity (recall) in favor of specificity and negative predictive value to reduce screening burden. ",Proceedings.

0.415726595,31531308,Modeling Urban Hydrology and Green Infrastructure Using the AGWA Urban Tool and the KINEROS2 Model,"Urban hydrology and green infrastructure (GI) can be modeled using the Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA) Urban tool and the Kinematic Runoff and Erosion (KINEROS2) model. The KINEROS2 model provides an urban modeling element with nine overland flow components that can be used to represent various land cover types commonly found in the built environment while treating runoff-runon and infiltration processes in a physically based manner. The AGWA Urban tool utilizes a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework to prepare parameters required for KINEROS2, executes the model, and imports results for visualization in the GIS. The AGWA Urban tool was validated on a residential subdivision in Arizona, USA, using 47 rainfall events (June 2005 to September 2006) to compare observed runoff volumes and peak flow rates with simulated results. Comparison of simulated and observed runoff volumes resulted in a slope of 1.00 for the regression equation with an R 2 value of 0.80. Comparison of observed and simulated peak flows had a slope of 1.12 with an R 2 value of 0.83. A roof runoff analysis was simulated for 787 events, from January 2006 through December 2015, to analyze the water availability from roof runoff capture. Simulation results indicated a 15% capture of the average monthly rainfall volume on the watershed. Additionally, rainwater captured from roofs has the potential to provide for up to 70% of the domestic annual per capita water use in this region. Five different scenarios (S1 - base, S2 - with retention basins, S3 - with permeable driveways, S4 - with rainwater harvesting cisterns, and S5 - all GI practices from S2, S3, and S4) were simulated over the same period to compare the effectiveness of GI implementation at the parcel level on runoff and peak flows at the watershed outlet. Simulation results indicate a higher runoff volume reduction for S2 (53.41 m 3 average capacity, average 30% reduction) as compared to S3 (average 14% reduction), or S4 (3.78 m 3 capacity, average 6% reduction). Analysis of peak flows reveal larger peak flow reduction for S2. S3 showed more reduction of smaller peak flows as compared to S4.",Frontiers in built environment,ENG

Poliovirus (PV) antibody seroprevalence studies assess population immunity, verify an immunization program‚Äôs performance and vaccine efficacy, and guide polio eradication strategy. Namibia experienced a polio outbreak among adults in 2006, yet population seroimmunity was unknown.    Methods.  We tested 2061 specimens from Namibian pregnant females aged 15‚Äì44 years for neutralizing antibody to PV types 1‚Äì3 (PV1‚Äì3); all females were sampled during the 2010 National HIV Sentinel Survey. We determined the proportion of females seropositive for PV antibody by 5-year age strata, and analyzed factors associated with seropositivity, including age, gravidity, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection status, residence, and antiretroviral treatment, by log-binomial regression.    Results.  The seroprevalence was 94.6% for PV1, 97.0% for PV2, and 85.1% for PV3. HIV-positive females had significantly lower seroprevalence than HIV-negative females for PV1 (91.8% vs 95.3%; P < .01) and PV3 (80.0% vs 86.1%; P < .01) but not for PV2 (96.4% vs 97.1%; P = .3). The prevalence ratio of seropositivity for HIV-positive females versus HIV-negative females was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], .92‚Äì.98) for PV1, 0.99 (95% CI, .97‚Äì1.01) for PV2, and 0.92 (95% CI, .87‚Äì.96) for PV3.    Conclusions.  Despite relatively high PV seroprevalence, Namibia might remain at risk for a PV outbreak, particularly in lower-seroprevalence populations, such as HIV-positive females. Namibia should continue to maintain high routine polio vaccination coverage.  ",The Journal of infectious diseases,EPIDEM
0.164832052,19828532,Interleukin-2 Therapy in Patients with HIV Infection,"  BACKGROUND  Used in combination with antiretroviral therapy, subcutaneous recombinant interleukin-2 raises CD4+ cell counts more than does antiretroviral therapy alone. The clinical implication of these increases is not known.    METHODS  We conducted two trials: the Subcutaneous Recombinant, Human Interleukin-2 in HIV-Infected Patients with Low CD4+ Counts under Active Antiretroviral Therapy (SILCAAT) study and the Evaluation of Subcutaneous Proleukin in a Randomized International Trial (ESPRIT). In each, patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had CD4+ cell counts of either 50 to 299 per cubic millimeter (SILCAAT) or 300 or more per cubic millimeter (ESPRIT) were randomly assigned to receive interleukin-2 plus antiretroviral therapy or antiretroviral therapy alone. The interleukin-2 regimen consisted of cycles of 5 consecutive days each, administered at 8-week intervals. The SILCAAT study involved six cycles and a dose of 4.5 million IU of interleukin-2 twice daily; ESPRIT involved three cycles and a dose of 7.5 million IU twice daily. Additional cycles were recommended to maintain the CD4+ cell count above predefined target levels. The primary end point of both studies was opportunistic disease or death from any cause.    RESULTS  In the SILCAAT study, 1695 patients (849 receiving interleukin-2 plus antiretroviral therapy and 846 receiving antiretroviral therapy alone) who had a median CD4+ cell count of 202 cells per cubic millimeter were enrolled; in ESPRIT, 4111 patients (2071 receiving interleukin-2 plus antiretroviral therapy and 2040 receiving antiretroviral therapy alone) who had a median CD4+ cell count of 457 cells per cubic millimeter were enrolled. Over a median follow-up period of 7 to 8 years, the CD4+ cell count was higher in the interleukin-2 group than in the group receiving antiretroviral therapy alone ‚Äî by 53 and 159 cells per cubic millimeter, on average, in the SILCAAT study and ESPRIT, respectively. Hazard ratios for opportunistic disease or death from any cause with interleukin-2 plus antiretroviral therapy (vs. antiretroviral therapy alone) were 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.18; P = 0.47) in the SILCAAT study and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.16; P = 0.55) in ESPRIT. The hazard ratios for death from any cause and for grade 4 clinical events were 1.06 (P = 0.73) and 1.10 (P = 0.35), respectively, in the SILCAAT study and 0.90 (P = 0.42) and 1.23 (P = 0.003), respectively, in ESPRIT.    CONCLUSIONS  Despite a substantial and sustained increase in the CD4+ cell count, as compared with antiretroviral therapy alone, interleukin-2 plus antiretroviral therapy yielded no clinical benefit in either study.

Unexpectedly, Mexican-American men had the highest testosterone level. Next, we evaluated whether the same patterns are observed during adolescence, the time of prostate maturation.    Methods  We measured serum testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) by immunoassay in 134 males aged 12‚Äì19 in NHANES III. Mean concentrations were compared by race/ethnicity adjusting for age, Tanner stage, percent body fat, waist, physical activity, tobacco smoke, and the other hormones.    Results  After multivariable adjustment, in the 12‚Äì15 year-old males, testosterone concentration was lower in non-Hispanic blacks than whites (P=0.043), SHBG concentration did not significantly differ between the two groups. Mexican-Americans had the highest testosterone (versus non-Hispanic black: P=0.002) and lowest SHBG (versus non-Hispanic white: P=0.010; versus non-Hispanic black: P=0.047) concentrations. Estradiol concentration was lower in non-Hispanic blacks (P=0.11) and Mexican-Americans (P=0.033) compared with non-Hispanic whites. After multivariable adjustment, in the 16‚Äì19 year-old males, testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG concentrations did not differ between non-Hispanic blacks and whites. Mexican-Americans had the highest testosterone concentration (versus non-Hispanic white: P=0.08), but did not differ from the other groups on estradiol and SHBG concentrations. In both age groups, these patterns were generally present, but less pronounced after adjusting for age and Tanner stage only.    Conclusion  In adolescent males, non-Hispanic blacks did not have a higher testosterone concentration than non-Hispanic whites, and Mexican-Americans had the highest testosterone concentration, patterns similar to adult males.

0.44336837,18793452,Infant feeding in Sweden: Socio-demographic determinants and associations with adiposity in childhood and adolescence,"Background Recent reviews and meta-analyses conclude that breastfeeding constitutes a small but consistent protective effect against obesity or higher values of body mass index (BMI) in children, though in some studies this effect was weakened after adjustment for potential confounders. The aim of this study was to explore the socio-demographic determinants of the duration of breastfeeding in Sweden and the associations between breastfeeding duration and adiposity in childhood and adolescence. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of Swedish children. Height, weight and waist circumference were measured and the sum of five skin fold measurements were obtained in 1137 9- and 15-year old children. Breastfeeding data were retrospectively obtained from the medical records for 812 (71.4%) children. Multiple ordinal logistic regression was applied to study individual effects of the maternal characteristics on the duration of breastfeeding. The relationship between children's anthropometric characteristics and duration of breastfeeding was studied by multiple linear regression. Associations between the odds of being overweight or obese and the duration of breastfeeding were studied by multiple logistic regression. Both linear and logistic models were adjusted for children's age, gender, birth weight, maternal education and parental BMI in 1998 as well as maternal age and smoking status at childbirth. Results Maternal education was positively associated with the duration of breastfeeding in both 1983 and 1989. Non-smoking mothers were more likely to breastfeed longer than smokers in 1989 (OR = 1.9, 95%CI: 1.3, 3.0). Fifteen-year old children breastfed for shorter than 2 months had 1.2 kg/m 2 (95%CI: 0.1, 2.4) higher BMI, 3.2 cm (95%CI: 0.2, 6.2) higher waist circumference and 10.6 mm (95%CI: 1.7, 19.6) higher sum of five skin fold measurements compared to those breastfed for 6 months or longer when adjusted for children's characteristics and maternal characteristics in 1998. Adjustment for maternal age and smoking status at childbirth weakened these associations to non-significant levels (0.9 kg/m 2 , 95%CI: -0.4, 2.1; 1.4 cm, 95%CI: -1.5, 4.4 and 5.1 mm, 95%CI: -4.0, 14.2, respectively). In the 9-year olds, the associations were less pronounced, but in the same direction. No trends between duration of breastfeeding and children's anthropometric characteristics were observed in any of the age groups. Conclusion Maternal education and smoking were significant predictors of breastfeeding duration in Sweden in the 1980s. Associations with measures of adiposity were observed only in 15-year old children between the children with shortest and longest breastfeeding duration, which were weakened after adjustment for maternal characteristics at childbirth.",International breastfeeding journal,EPIDEM
0.370281505,23705121,The Effects of Removable Denture on Swallowing,"Objective To investigate the relationship between removable dentures and swallowing and describe risks. Methods Twenty-four patients with removable dentures who were referred for videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) were enrolled. We evaluated the change of swallowing function using VFSS before and after the removal of the removable denture. The masticatory performance by Kazunori's method, sensation of oral cavity by Christian's method, underlying disease, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale for level of consciousness were collected. Functional dysphagia scales, including the oral transit time (OTT), pharyngeal transit time (PTT), percentage of oral residue, percentage of pharyngeal residue, oropharyngeal swallow efficiency (OPSE), and presence of aspiration were measured. Results Four patients dropped out and 20 patients were analyzed (stroke, 13 patients; pneumonia, 3 patients; and others, 4 patients). The mean age was 73.3¬±11.4 years. There were significant differences before and after the removal of the denture for the OTT. OTT was significantly less after the removal of the denture (8.87 vs. 4.38 seconds, p=0.01). OPSE increased remarkably after the removal of the denture, but without significance (18.24%/sec vs. 25.26%/sec, p=0.05). The OTT and OPSE, while donning a removable denture, were correlated with the masticatory performance (OTT, p=0.04; OPSE, p=0.003) and sensation of oral cavity (OTT, p=0.006; OPSE, p=0.007). Conclusion A removable denture may have negative effects on swallowing, especially OTT and OPSE.

The pathogenesis is complex and missense mutations in FBLN5 have been reported in association with ARMD. We have investigated the role of fibulin 5 in ARMD by completing the first European study of the gene FBLN5 in ARMD (using 2 European cohorts of 805 ARMD patients and 279 controls) and by determining the functional effects of the missense mutations on fibulin 5 expression. We also correlated the FBLN5 genotype with the ARMD phenotype. We found two novel sequence changes in ARMD patients that were absent in controls and expressed these and the other nine reported FBLN5 mutations associated with ARMD and two associated with the autosomal recessive disease cutis laxa. Fibulin 5 secretion was significantly reduced (P<0.001) for four ARMD (p.G412E, p.G267S, p.I169 T, and p.Q124P) and two cutis laxa (p.S227P, p.C217R) mutations. These results suggest that some missense mutations associated with ARMD lead to decreased fibulin 5 secretion with a possible corresponding reduction in elastinogenesis. This study confirms the previous work identifying an association between FBLN5 mutations and ARMD and for the first time suggests a functional mechanism by which these mutations can lead to ARMD. It further demonstrates that FBLN5 mutations can be associated with different phenotypes of ARMD (not limited to the previously described cuticular drusen type). Such knowledge may ultimately lead to the development of novel therapies for this common disease. ",Human mutation,POPGENE

This conclusion remains tenuous, as previous studies employed tasks requiring active processing of visual speech movements which may have elicited conscious sub-vocalizations. To study whether Broca‚Äôs area is modulated during passive viewing of speech movements, we conducted a fMRI experiment where participants detected rare and brief visual targets that were briefly superimposed on two task irrelevant conditions: passive viewing of silent speech versus non-speech (gurning) facial movements.

The ‚Äòamyloid cascade hypothesis‚Äô posits that cerebral amyloid sets neurotoxic events into motion that precipitate Alzheimer dementia ( Hardy and Allsop, 1991 ). Yet, faithful recapitulation of all AD features in widely used transgenic (Tg) mice engineered to overproduce AŒ≤ peptides has been elusive. We have developed a Tg rat model (line TgF344-AD) expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein ( APP sw ) and presenilin 1 ( PS1ŒîE9 ) genes, each independent causes of early-onset familial AD. TgF344-AD rats manifest age-dependent cerebral amyloidosis that precedes tauopathy, gliosis, apoptotic loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and cognitive disturbance. These results demonstrate progressive neurodegeneration of the Alzheimer type in these animals. The TgF344-AD rat fills a critical need for a next-generation animal model to enable basic and translational AD research.

0.844042252,31198905,Fluorescent tools to analyse peroxisome-ER interactions in mammalian cells," Peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cooperate extensively in lipid-related metabolic pathways, and the ER also provides phospholipids to enable the peroxisomal membrane to expand prior to division. Recently, we identified peroxisomal proteins ACBD5 and ACBD4, and the ER protein VAPB as tethering components which physically interact to foster peroxisome-ER associations at membrane contact sites. Overexpression or loss of these tether proteins alters the extent of peroxisome-ER interactions, impacting on lipid exchange between these two compartments. To facilitate further studies into peroxisome-ER associations at the level of membrane contact sites, their role, composition and regulation, we have developed two fluorescence-based systems to monitor peroxisome-ER interactions. We modified a proximity ligation assay and a split-fluorescence reporter system using split superfolder green fluorescent protein. Using the proximity ligation assay we were able to measure changes in peroxisome-ER interactions whilst the split-fluorescence reporter was more limited and only allowed us to label ER-peroxisome contacts. We show that both techniques can be useful additions to the toolkit of methods to study peroxisome-ER associations and explore the relative merits of each.

Design  Retrospective cross-sectional study.    Participants  A total of 67 consecutive patients (67 eyes) with diabetic macular edema (DME) who underwent Stratus OCT imaging.    Methods  Best-corrected Snellen visual acuity was recorded for each patient. Raw exported Stratus OCT images for each patient were analyzed using custom software entitled ‚ÄúOCTOR‚Äù, which allows the precise positioning of prespecified boundaries on individual B-scans. Thickness, volume, and intensity were calculated for neurosensory retina and subretinal fluid. In addition, photoreceptor outer segment (POS) thickness was quantified.    Main Outcome Measures  OCT-derived measurements of retinal morphology and visual acuity.    Results  The Spearman coefficient values (r) of the correlation between OCTOR-derived measurements of central subfield thickness, intensity, subretinal fluid (SRF) volume, POS thickness and logMAR visual acuities (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) were 0.3428 (p=0.005), -0.2658 (p=0.03), -0.2683 (p=0.38), -0.3703 (p=0.002) respectively. Multivariate models with stepwise selection revealed a cumulative R 2 of 0.4305 in the total study population, with R 2 of 0.4999 and 0.7628 in the untreated and prior focal laser groups, respectively.    Conclusions  Subanalysis and quantification of OCT features in eyes with DME appears to be of value. In particular, photoreceptor outer segment thickness appears to be an important predictor of function and visual acuity in patients with DME.  ",Ophthalmology,CLINIC

Cellular prion protein (Pr PC ) initiates synaptic damage as a high affinity receptor for A√üo. Here, we evaluated the preclinical therapeutic efficacy of a fully human monoclonal antibody against Pr PC . This AZ 59 antibody selectively targets the AŒ≤o binding site in the amino‚Äêterminal unstructured domain of Pr PC to avoid any potential risk of direct toxicity. Methods Potency of AZ 59 was evaluated by binding to Pr PC , blockade of AŒ≤o interaction and interruption of AŒ≤o signaling. AZ 59 was administered to mice by weekly intraperitoneal dosing and brain antibody measured. APP / PS 1 transgenic mice were treated with AZ 59 and assessed by memory tests, by brain biochemistry and by histochemistry for A√ü, gliosis and synaptic density. Results  AZ 59 binds Pr PC with 100¬†pmol/L affinity and blocks human brain A√üo binding to Pr PC , as well as prevents synaptotoxic signaling. Weekly i.p. dosing of 20¬†mg/kg AZ 59 in a murine form achieves trough brain antibody levels greater than 10¬†nmol/L. Aged symptomatic APP / PS 1 transgenic mice treated with AZ 59 for 5‚Äì7¬†weeks show a full rescue of behavioral and synaptic loss phenotypes. This recovery occurs without clearance of plaque pathology or elimination of gliosis. AZ 59 treatment also normalizes synaptic signaling abnormalities in transgenic brain. These benefits are dose‚Äêdependent and persist for at least 1¬†month after the last dose.

Methods Eighteen Sahiwal calves were divided into three groups, based on average body weight (87.24 kg) and age (6 to 12 mo), and treatments were assigned to the different groups randomly. The first group (GP-I) was kept as control and received GNC-based concentrate mixture. In second (GP-II) and third (GP-III) groups, 750 g/kg nitrogen (N) of GNC was substituted by RGM and MGM respectively, with similar forage:concentrate ratio (56:44). Results The 90 days of experimental feeding revealed that intake of dry matter, crude protein and digestibility coefficients for all nutrients did not differ among groups. Furthermore, although N balance was greater (p‚â§0.05) for GP-III than GP-I and GP-II, average daily gain was similar between GP-I and GP-II but greater (p‚â§0.05) for GP-III. In addition, feed efficiency and related haematological variables did not differ due to treatments. Conclusion Nutritional worth of GNC and RGM was highly comparable in terms of intake, digestibility and growth in growing calves.

This study investigated the relationship between early subclinical autistic traits and the occurrence of later developmental and behavioural problems as well as problems in cognitive and language functioning. Parents of infants aged 14‚Äì15¬†months from the general population completed the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire (ESAT). Three groups of children with high, moderate, and low ESAT-scores (total n =¬†103) were selected. Follow-up assessments included the CBCL 1¬Ω‚Äì5 at age 3¬†years, and the SCQ, the ADI-R, the ADOS-G, a non-verbal intelligence test, and language tests for comprehension and production at age 4‚Äì5¬†years. None of the children met criteria for autism spectrum disorder at follow-up. Children with high ESAT-scores at 14‚Äì15¬†months showed significantly more internalizing and externalizing problems at age 3¬†years and scored significantly lower on language tests at age 4‚Äì5¬†years than children with moderate or low ESAT-scores. Further, significantly more children with high ESAT-scores (14/26, 53.8%) than with moderate and low ESAT-scores (5/36, 13.9% and 1/41, 2.4%, respectively) were in the high-risk/clinical range on one or more outcome domains (autistic symptoms, behavioural problems, cognitive and language abilities). Subclinical autistic traits at 14‚Äì15¬†months predict later behavioural problems and delays in cognitive and language functioning rather than later ASD-diagnoses. The theoretical implications of the findings lie in the pivotal role of early social and communication skills for the development of self-regulation of emotions and impulses. The practical implications bear on the early recognition of children at risk for behavioural problems and for language and cognitive problems.",European child & adolescent psychiatry,PSYCH

However, UCK of Thermus thermophilus HB8 (ttCK) phosphorylates only cytidine. This cytidine-restricted activity is thought to depend on Tyr93, although the precise mechanism remains unresolved. Exhaustive mutagenesis of Tyr93 in ttCK revealed that the uridine phosphorylation activity was restored only by replacement of Tyr93 with His or Gln. Replacement of His117 in human UCK2, corresponding to residue Tyr93 in ttCK, by Tyr resulted in a loss of uridine phosphorylation activity. These findings indicated that uridine phosphorylation activity commonly depends on a single residue in the UCK family.

The United States Agency for International Development PrevenSida project is aimed at increasing healthy behavior among KPs and people with HIV and improving testing, counseling, and continuity of prevention and treatment by building capacity and improving performance of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing services to KPs. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PrevenSida‚Äôs activities. Methods This retrospective observational evaluation used individuals in KPs covered by NGOs receiving assistance from PrevenSida from 2012 to 2014. Cost-effectiveness analysis compared PrevenSida‚Äôs intervention with business-as-usual. Model inputs were generated from epidemiological modeling and PrevenSida‚Äôs records. Results By 2014, 24 NGOs received grants and technical assistance from PrevenSida with 72,955 people in KPs served at $11.32/person ($9.39‚Äì$16.55/person, depending on region). The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $50,700/HIV case averted or $2,600/Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted (95% CI: $1,000‚Äì$99,000 and $50‚Äì$5,100, respectively). Conclusion PrevenSida distributed about $600,000 in grants and used $230,000 to support 24 NGOs in 2014. Cost-effectiveness from the program perspective compared to no program was slightly over half of GDP per capita per DALY averted, considered highly cost-effective by WHO criteria. Cost and efficiency varied by region, reflecting the number of people in KPs receiving services. Cost-sharing by NGOs improved cost-effectiveness from the program perspective and likely promotes sustainability.

0.095441399,27654698,A Longitudinal Study of Fathers‚Äô and Young Children‚Äôs Depressive Symptoms,"  Objective:  Considerableresearch has examinedthe effects of maternal depression on children, but few studieshave focused on the relation between paternal and child depressive symptoms, particularly during early childhood. Even fewer studies have been longitudinal, leaving open questions about how paternal and child depression covary over time. The present study sought to address this gap by examining the relation between fathers‚Äô and children‚Äôs depressive symptoms over a 3-year period.    Method:  Participants were153 preschool childrenwith behavior problems and their parents. Three longitudinal analytic approacheswere used to examine how father and child depression change together and predict one another over time.Additional analyses examined whetherexternalizing problems or maternal depression might account for the associations between fathers‚Äô and children‚Äôs depressive symptoms.    Results:  Changes in paternal depression significantly predicted changes in father-reported and mother-reported child depressive symptoms. These effects were evident both in year-to-year fluctuations as well as in linear trajectories across the 3-year period. Cross-lagged analyses suggested that these relationsmay have beendriven by father-effects; paternal depression at one time point predicted child depression at the next time point, but child depression did not significantly predict later paternal depression. We found little evidence that externalizing problems or maternal depression accounted for the relations between fathers‚Äô and children‚Äôs depressive symptoms.    Conclusions:  Results provide convergent evidencethat fathers‚Äô depression may play an important role in the development of depressive symptoms in young children, and underscore the importance of including fathers in studies of depression in families.

0.074908458,29398366,Rbfox splicing factors promote neuronal maturation and axon initial segment assembly," Summary  Neuronal maturation requires dramatic morphological and functional changes, but the molecular mechanisms governing this process are not well understood. Here, we studied the role of Rbfox1-3 proteins, a family of tissue-specific splicing regulators mutated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. We generated Rbfox triple knockout (tKO) ventral spinal neurons to define a comprehensive network of alternative exons under Rbfox regulation and to investigate their functional importance in the developing neurons. Rbfox tKO neurons exhibit defects in alternative splicing of many cytoskeletal, membrane, and synaptic proteins, and display immature electrophysiological activity. The axon initial segment (AIS), a subcellular structure important for action potential initiation, is diminished upon Rbfox depletion. We identified an Rbfox-regulated splicing switch in ankyrin G, the AIS ‚Äúinteraction hub‚Äù protein, that regulates ankyrin G-beta spectrin affinity and AIS assembly. Our data show that the Rbfox-regulated splicing program plays a crucial role in structural and functional maturation of postmitotic neurons.   eTOC Blurb  Jacko et al. identified a comprehensive neuronal Rbfox splicing program, enriched for cytoskeletal, membrane, and synaptic genes.

0.547407233,17347781,Functional expression of inward rectifier potassium channels in cultured human pulmonary smooth muscle cells evidence for a major role of Kir2.4 subunits," Strong inwardly rectifying K + (K IR ) channels that contribute to maintaining the resting membrane potential are encoded by the Kir2.0 family (Kir2.1-2.4). In smooth muscle, K IR currents reported so far have the characteristics of Kir2.1. However, Kir2.4, which exhibits unique characteristics of barium block, has been largely overlooked. Using patch-clamp techniques, we characterized K IR channels in cultured human pulmonary artery smooth muscle (HPASM) cells and compared to cloned Kir2.1 and Kir2.4 channels. In a physiological K + gradient, inwardly rectifying currents were observed in HPASM cells, the magnitude and reversal potential of which were sensitive to extracellular K + concentration. Ba 2+ (100ŒºM) significantly inhibited inward currents and depolarised HPASM cells by ‚àº10mV. In 60mM extracellular K + , Ba 2+ blocked K IR currents in HPASM cells with IC 50 of 39.1ŒºM at ‚àí100mV, compared to 3.9ŒºM and 65.6ŒºM for Kir2.1 and Kir2.4, respectively. Cloned Kir2.4 and K IR currents in HPASM cells showed little voltage dependence to Ba 2+ inhibition, which blocked at a more superficial site than for Kir2.1. Single channel recordings revealed strong inwardly rectifying channels with an average conductance of 21pS in HPASM cells, not significantly different from either Kir2.1 (19.6pS) or Kir2.4 (19.4pS). RT-PCR detected products corresponding to Kir2.1, Kir2.2 and Kir2.4 but not Kir2.3. We demonstrate that cultured HPASM cells express K IR channels and suggest both Kir2.1 and Kir2.4 subunits contribute to these channels, although the whole-cell current characteristics described, share more similarity with Kir2.4.

Identification and isolation of HSCs for study has depended on the expression of combinations of surface markers on HSCs that reliably distinguish them from other cell types. However, the increasing number of markers required to isolate HSCs has made it tedious, expensive, and difficult for newcomers, suggesting the need for a simpler panel of HSC markers. We previously showed that phenotypic HSCs could be separated based on expression of CD11a and that only the CD11a negative fraction contained true HSCs. Here, we show that CD11a and another HSC marker, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), can be used to effectively identify and purify HSCs. We introduce a new two‚Äêcolor HSC sorting method that can highly enrich for HSCs with efficiencies comparable to the gold standard combination of CD150 and CD48.

One of the potential mechanisms underpinning this is through effects on the epigenome, particularly changes in DNA methylation. Using a well-phenotyped cohort of 83 men from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study, who experienced ELS in the form of separation from their parents during childhood, and a group of 83 matched controls, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in peripheral blood. We found no differences in DNA methylation between men who were separated from their families and non-separated men; however, we did identify differences in DNA methylation in association with the development of at least mild depressive symptoms over the subsequent 5‚Äì10 years. Notably, hypomethylation was identified at a number of genes with roles in brain development and/or function in association with depressive symptoms. Pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of DNA methylation changes in pathways associated with development and morphogenesis, DNA and transcription factor binding and programmed cell death.

0.436195534,15580264,Coupling of ER exit to microtubules through direct interaction of COPII with dynactin," Transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi is mediated by the sequential action of two coat complexes: COPII concentrates cargo for secretion at ER export sites, then COPI is subsequently recruited to nascent carriers and retrieves recycling proteins back to the ER. These carriers then move towards the Golgi along microtubules, driven by the dynein/dynactin complexes. Here we show that the Sec23p component of the COPII complex directly interacts with the dynactin complex through the carboxy-terminal cargo-binding domain of p150 Glued . Functional assays, including measurements of the rate of recycling of COPII on the ER membrane and quantitative analyses of secretion, indicate that this interaction underlies functional coupling of ER export to microtubules. Together, our data suggest a mechanism by which membranes of the early secretory pathway can be linked to motors and microtubules for subsequent organization and movement to the Golgi apparatus.

0.345795611,31156721,Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for the collection and direct measurement of adsorbed alpha-emitting radionuclides from environmental waters by liquid scintillation analysis ‚Ä†," Radioactive contamination, be it from accidental or intentional release, can create an urgent need to assess water and food supplies and the environment, and monitor human health. In the event of such an emergency, rapid and efficient methods may be needed to assess contamination levels in scores of samples within a short time frame. Internalized exposure to radionuclides that decay by alpha (Œ±) emission can be especially hazardous, given the strongly ionizing nature of the Œ± particle. Unfortunately, the determination of Œ±-emitting radionuclides using traditional radioanalytical methods is typically labor and resource intensive and time consuming. In an effort to devise methods that are fast, require little labor and laboratory expendables, and minimize the use of toxic or corrosive reagents, researchers at PNNL have evaluated superparamagnetic nanoparticles as extracting agents for Œ±-emitting radionuclides from chemically unmodified and acidified (pH 2) aqueous systems. It is demonstrated that bare magnetite nanoparticles exhibit strong affinity for two representative Œ±-emitting radionuclides ( 241 Am and 210 Po) from two representative aqueous matrices (river and ground water). Furthermore, use of the superparamagnetic properties of these nanomaterials to concentrate the analyte-bearing solids from the bulk aqueous solution has been demonstrated. The nanoparticle concentrate can be either directly dispensed into a scintillation cocktail, or first dissolved and then added to a scintillation cocktail as a solution for an Œ±-emission assay by liquid scintillation analysis. Despite the severe quenching caused by the metal oxide suspensions in the cocktail, the authors have demonstrated that modern liquid scintillation analyzers can report accurate Œ± activity count rates; the upper limits of nanoparticle suspension concentrations in a cocktail are reported for cases wherein normal instrument count mode and a quench correction protocol are used. Discussions are provided on the presented sample processing and analysis method, the improvement (lowering) of minimum detectable activity concentrations using the nanoparticle-based assay method, and the quenching effects of nanoparticle suspensions in a scintillation cocktail.

0.614701259,18768842,Cytokine-mediated inhibition of fibrillar amyloid-Œ≤ peptide degradation by human mononuclear phagocytes 1," Vaccination therapy of AD animal models and patients strongly suggests an active role of brain mononuclear phagocytes in immune-mediated clearance of amyloid-Œ≤ peptides (AŒ≤) in brain. Although AŒ≤ uptake by macrophages can be regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, their effects on macrophage-mediated AŒ≤ degradation are poorly understood. To better understand this mechanism of degradation, we examined whether pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines affect the degradation of AŒ≤ using primary cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and microglia using pulse-chase analysis of fibrillar and oligomer 125 I-AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42. Initial uptake of fibrillar AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 was 40% and its degradation was saturated by 120 hrs in both MDM and microglia, compared to an initial uptake of oligomeric AŒ≤ less than 0.5% and saturation of degradation within 24 hrs. Interferon-Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥) increased the intracellular retention of fibrillar AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 by inhibiting degradation, whereas interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and transforming growth factor-Œ≤1 (TGF-Œ≤1), but not IL-13 and IL-27, enhanced degradation. Fibrillar AŒ≤ degradation in MDM is sensitive to lysosomal and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) inhibitors but insensitive to proteasomal and neprilysin inhibitors. IFN-Œ≥ and TNF-Œ± directly reduced the expression of IDE and chaperone molecules (Hsp70 and Hsc70), which are involved in refolding of aggregated proteins. Co-culture of MDM with activated, but not na√Øve T cells, suppressed AŒ≤ degradation in MDM, which was partially blocked by a combination of neutralizing antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines suppress AŒ≤ degradation in MDM, whereas select anti-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines antagonize these effects.

0.154598819,17062152,Not every pseudoword disrupts word recognition: an ERP study,"Background If all available acoustic phonetic information of words is used during lexical access and consequently stored in the mental lexicon, then all pseudowords that deviate in a single acoustic feature from a word should hamper word recognition. By contrast, models assuming underspecification of redundant phonological information in the mental lexicon predict a differential disruption of word recognition dependent on the phonological structure of the pseudoword. Using neurophysiological measures, the present study tested the predicted asymmetric disruption by assuming that coronal place of articulation for consonants is redundant. Methods Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a lexical decision task. The focus of interest was on word medial consonants. The crucial pseudowords were created by replacing the place of articulation of the medial consonant in German disyllabic words. We analyzed the differential temporal characteristics of the N400 pseudoword effect. Results N400 amplitudes for pseudowords were enhanced compared to words. As the uniqueness and deviation points differ for coronal and non-coronal items, the ERPs had to be correspondingly adjusted. The adjusted ERPs revealed that the N400 pseudoword effect starts earlier for coronal than for non-coronal pseudoword variants. Thus, non-coronal variants are accepted as words longer than the coronal variants. Conclusion Our results indicate that lexical representations of words containing medial coronal consonants are initially activated by their corresponding non-coronal pseudowords. The most plausible explanation for the asymmetric neuronal processing of coronal and non-coronal pseudoword variants is an underspecified coronal place of articulation in the mental lexicon.",Behavioral and brain functions : BBF,NEURO

Alterations in 20S PTMs have been previously observed with changes in modified protein degradation patterns and altered cellular phenotypes. Despite decades of investigation, our knowledge pertaining to the various PTMs of 20S complexes and their biological significance remain limited. In this investigation, we show that two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) offers an analytical tool with high resolution and reproducibility. Accordingly, it has been applied for the characterization of PTMs including glycosylation, phosphorylation, oxidation, and nitrosylation. The PTMs of murine cardiac 20S proteasomes and their associating proteins were examined. Our 2-DE analyses displayed over 25 spots for the 20S complexes (17 subunits), indicating multiply modified subunits of cardiac proteasomes. The identification of specific PTM sites subsequent to 2-DE were supported by mass spectrometry. These PTMs included phosphorylation and oxidation. Most of the PTMs occurred in low stoichiometry and required enrichment to enhance the detection sensitivity.

0.275144881,27503014,Is There a Reliable Method to Predict the Limb Length Discrepancy after Chemotherapy and Limb Salvage Surgery in Children with Osteosarcoma?,"Background: For a child with osteosarcoma, prediction of the limb length discrepancy at maturity is important when planning for limb salvage surgery. The purpose of this study was to provide a reliable prediction method. Methods: A retrospective review of Chinese children receiving chemotherapy for osteosarcoma before skeletal maturity was conducted. Standing full-length radiographs of the lower extremity were used for length measurements. Length-for-age curves were constructed using the LMS method. The lower limb multiplier for a specific age and gender was calculated using the formula M = L m /L, where M was the gender- and age-specific multiplier, L m was the bone length at maturity, and L was the age-specific bone length. Prematurity and postmaturity radiographs were used to assess the accuracy of the prediction methods. Results: A total of 513 radiographs of 131 boys and 314 radiographs of 86 girls were used to calculate the coefficients of the multiplier. The multipliers of 8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, 12-, 13-, 14-, 15-, 16-, 17-, and 18-year-old boys after chemotherapy for osteosarcoma were 1.394, 1.306, 1.231, 1.170, 1.119, 1.071, 1.032, 1.010, 1.004, 1.001, and 1.000, respectively; while for girls at the same ages, the multipliers were 1.311, 1.221, 1.146, 1.092, 1.049, 1.021, 1.006, 1.001, 1.000, 1.000, and 1.000, respectively. Prematurity and postmaturity femoral and tibial lengths of 21 patients were used to assess the prediction accuracy. The mean prediction error was 0 cm, 0.8 cm, and 1.6 cm for the multiplier method using our coefficients, Paley's coefficients, and Anderson's method, respectively. Conclusions: Our coefficients for the multiplier method are reliable in predicting lower limb length growth of Chinese children with osteosarcoma.",Chinese medical journal,CLINIC
0.320557737,19484791,Medical Interpreter Knowledge of Cancer and Cancer Clinical Trials,"  Background:  Cancer patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) may need specialized assistance to communicate with health professionals about cancer and clinical trials.    Methods:  Medical interpreters working in several Boston-area hospitals were invited to participate in training sessions about cancer and cancer clinical trials. We did a pre and post survey-based assessment of knowledge of basic concepts in cancer and clinical trials, and post-assessment of satisfaction, among 97 interpreters in cancer training and education sessions and 79 participants in clinical trial training and education sessions.    Results:  Participants had a range of prior experience with interpretation in the context of cancer and clinical trials. Training increased mean accuracy from 49% to 72% in knowledge items about cancer, and from 72% to 78% in knowledge about clinical trials. Interpreters reported several areas of concern with respect to standards of practice.    Conclusion:  Pretest surveys of medical interpreters revealed several areas of important knowledge gaps about cancer and clinical trials. Post-test assessment showed that training can be useful to improving short term accuracy, but that more work is needed to develop curricula and testing measures to address these knowledge gaps.

0.443741355,29968103,One- vs two-phase extraction: re-evaluation of sample preparation procedures for untargeted lipidomics in plasma samples,"Lipidomics is a rapidly developing field in modern biomedical research. While LC-MS systems are able to detect most of the known lipid classes in a biological matrix, there is no single technique able to extract all of them simultaneously. In comparison with two-phase extractions, one-phase extraction systems are of particular interest, since they decrease the complexity of the experimental procedure. By using an untargeted lipidomics approach, we explored the differences/similarities between the most commonly used two-phase extraction systems (Folch, Bligh and Dyer, and MTBE) and one of the more recently introduced one-phase extraction systems for lipid analysis based on the MMC solvent mixture (MeOH/MTBE/CHCl 3 ). The four extraction methods were evaluated and thoroughly compared against a pooled extract that qualitatively and quantitatively represents the average of the combined extractions. Our results show that the lipid profile obtained with the MMC system displayed the highest similarity to the pooled extract, indicating that it was most representative of the lipidome in the original sample. Furthermore, it showed better extraction efficiencies for moderate and highly apolar lipid species in comparison with the Folch, Bligh and Dyer, and MTBE extraction systems. Finally, the technical simplicity of the MMC procedure makes this solvent system highly suitable for automated, untargeted lipidomics analysis.

0.71923292,17101690,Mechanisms of top-down facilitation in perception of visual objects studied by fMRI," Summary  Prior knowledge regarding the possible identity of an object facilitates its recognition from a degraded visual input, though the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Previous work implicated ventral visual cortex, but did not disambiguate whether activity-changes in these regions are causal to or merely reflect an effect of facilitated recognition. We used fMRI to study top-down influences on processing of gradually-revealed objects, by preceding each object with a name that was congruent or incongruent with the object. Congruently primed objects were recognised earlier than incongruently primed, and this was paralleled by shifts in activation profiles for ventral visual, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Prior to recognition, defined on a trial-by-trial basis, activity in ventral visual cortex rose gradually, but equivalently for congruently and incongruently primed objects. In contrast, pre-recognition activity was greater with congruent priming in lateral parietal, retrosplenial, and lateral prefrontal cortices, while functional coupling between parietal and ventral visual (and also left lateral prefrontal and parietal) cortices was enhanced in the same context. Thus, when controlling for recognition point and stimulus information, activity in ventral visual cortex mirrors recognition success, independent of condition. Facilitation by top-down cues involves lateral parietal cortex interacting with ventral visual areas, potentially explaining why parietal lesions can lead to deficits in recognising degraded objects even in the context of top-down knowledge.

Objective To analyze demographic and clinical differences among NMOSD patients without ON or TM, those with either ON or TM, and patients with simultaneous ON and TM at disease onset. Methods In this retrospective study, patients who were positive for the AQP4 antibody, as detected using a cell-based assay, at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China were recruited. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from each patient‚Äôs medical record. Results A total of 292 patients were included in this study and were divided into four subgroups based on their initial manifestations: (i) NMOSD without ON or TM (NMOSD-ON ‚àí TM ‚àí , n =‚Äâ70); (ii) NMOSD with ON (NMOSD-ON + , n =‚Äâ95); (iii) NMOSD with TM (NMOSD-TM + , n =‚Äâ116); and (iv) simultaneous ON and TM [neuromyelitis optica (NMO), n =‚Äâ11]. We found that age at onset was lower in the NMOSD-ON ‚àí TM ‚àí group than that in the other groups. The interval from the first episode to relapse was shorter in the NMOSD-ON ‚àí TM ‚àí group than that in NMOSD-TM + group. Cerebral spinal fluid white cell counts and protein levels were significantly higher in the NMOSD-ON ‚àí TM ‚àí group than those in the other groups. Lower Expanded Disability Status Scale scores were observed in the NMOSD-ON ‚àí TM ‚àí group. Brain abnormalities, including in area postrema and hemisphere lesions, were more frequent in the NMOSD-ON ‚àí TM ‚àí group. Kaplan‚ÄìMeier analysis showed that patients in the NMOSD-ON ‚àí TM ‚àí group experienced earlier relapse than those in other groups. Conversion to NMO in the NMOSD-ON + group was greater than that in the other groups. Only 14 patients (4.8%, 14/292) had pure brain abnormalities, of which 12 had disease duration of several more years and 8 (57.1%) experienced relapses.

0.945486215,26796692,Structures of Neural Correlation and How They Favor Coding," Summary  The neural representation of information suffers from ‚Äúnoise‚Äù‚Äîthe trial-to-trial variability in the response of neurons. The impact of correlated noise upon population coding has been debated, but a direct connection between theory and experiment remains tenuous. Here, we substantiate this connection and propose a refined theoretical picture. Using simultaneous recordings from a population of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells, we demonstrate that coding benefits from noise correlations. The effect is appreciable already in small populations, yet it is a collective phenomenon. Furthermore, the stimulus-dependent structure of correlation is key. We develop simple functional models that capture the stimulus-dependent statistics. We then use them to quantify the performance of population coding, which depends upon interplays of feature sensitivities and noise correlations in the population. Because favorable structures of correlation emerge robustly in circuits with noisy, nonlinear elements, they will arise and benefit coding beyond the confines of retina. ",Neuron,NEURO
0.966081873,29555457,Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial to Reduce Readmission for Heart Failure Using Novel Tablet and Nurse Practitioner Education,"  Background  Heart failure education programs are not standardized. The best form of education is unclear. We evaluated whether addition of a novel tablet application to nurse practitioner (NP) education was superior to NP education alone in reducing 30-day readmission after heart failure hospitalization.    Methods  From 2/2015‚Äì3/2016, patients admitted to a quaternary academic center with primary diagnosis of heart failure were randomized to (1) treatment- NP education plus tablet application (interactive conditional logic program that flags patient questions to medical staff) or (2) control- NP education. The primary outcome was reduction in 30-day readmission rate. Secondary outcomes included satisfaction and education assessed via survey.    Results  Randomization included 60 patients to treatment and 66 to control. A total of 13 patients withdrew prior to intervention (treatment n=4, control n=1) or were lost to follow-up (treatment n=3, control n=5). The 30-day readmission rate trended lower for treatment compared to control, but results were not statistically significant [13.2% (7/53), 26.7% (16/60), respectively, p=0.08]. Similarly, satisfaction trended higher with treatment than control (p=0.08). Treatment patients rated explanations from their physicians higher than control (Always: 83.7%, 55.8%, respectively, p=0.01).    Conclusions  NP education plus tablet use was not associated with significantly lower 30-day readmission rates in comparison to NP alone, but a positive trend was seen. Patient satisfaction trended higher and heart failure explanations were better with NP education plus tablet. A larger study is needed to determine if NP education plus tablet reduces readmission rates following heart failure admission.  ",The American journal of medicine,CLINIC
0.820796146,25582452,Decreased photosynthesis in the  erect panicle 3  ( ep3 ) mutant of rice is associated with reduced stomatal conductance and attenuated guard cell development,"The ERECT PANICLE 3 gene of rice encodes a peptide that exhibits more than 50% sequence identity with the Arabidopsis F-box protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS). Ectopic expression of the Os02g15950 coding sequence, driven by the HWS ( At3g61950 ) promoter, rescued the hws-1 flower phenotype in Arabidopsis confirming that EP3 is a functional orthologue of HWS . In addition to displaying an erect inflorescence phenotype, loss-of-function mutants of Os02g15950 exhibited a decrease in leaf photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance. Analysis of a range of physiological and anatomical features related to leaf photosynthesis revealed no alteration in Rubisco content and no notable changes in mesophyll size or arrangement. However, both ep3 mutant plants and transgenic lines that have a T-DNA insertion within the Os02g15950 ( EP3 ) gene exhibit smaller stomatal guard cells compared with their wild-type controls. This anatomical characteristic may account for the observed decrease in leaf photosynthesis and provides evidence that EP3 plays a role in regulating stomatal guard cell development.",Journal of experimental botany,ANIMAL
0.147224151,28736622,Nutrition and osteoporosis prevention for the orthopaedic surgeon A wholefoods approach,"Osteoporosis is a prevalent and debilitating condition with no signs of subsiding. Rising numbers of people consuming nutrient-poor diets coupled with ageing populations and sedentary lifestyles appear to be the main drivers behind this. While the nutrients calcium and vitamin D have received most attention, there is growing evidence that wholefoods and other micronutrients have roles to play in primary and potentially secondary osteoporosis prevention. Until recently, calcium and vitamin D were regarded as the main nutrients essential to bone health but now there are emerging roles for iron, copper and selenium, among others. Fruit and vegetables are still not being eaten in adequate amounts and yet contain micronutrients and phytochemicals useful for bone remodelling (bone formation and resorption) and are essential for reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. There is emerging evidence that dried fruits, such as prunes, provide significant amounts of vitamin K, manganese, boron, copper and potassium which could help to support bone health. Just 50 g of prunes daily have been found to reduce bone resorption after six months when eaten by osteopaenic, postmenopausal women. Dairy foods have an important role in bone health. Carbonated drinks should not replace milk in the diet. A balanced diet containing food groups and nutrients needed for bone health across the whole lifecycle may help to prevent osteoporosis. Greater efforts are needed to employ preventative strategies which involve dietary and physical activity modifications, if the current situation is to improve.

Cross-sectional OCT images were recorded on 40 lenses from 32 human donors with an age range of 6 ‚Äì 82 years. A method has been developed to measure the axial thickness and average refractive index of the lens from a single recorded image. The measured average group refractive index at the measurement wavelength of 825 nm was converted to the average phase refractive index at 589 nm using lens dispersion data from the literature. The average refractive index for all lenses measured was 1.408 ¬± 0.005 which agrees well with recent MRI measurements of the lens index gradient. A linear regression of the data resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the average refractive index with age, but a simple linear model was insufficient to explain the age dependence. The results presented here suggest that the peak refractive index in the nucleus is closer to 1.420, rather than the previously accepted value of 1.406. ",Vision research,NEURO
0.373321109,17464359,"gemini pollen 2 , a male and female gametophytic cytokinesis defective mutation"," Gametophytic cytokinesis is essential for the development and function of the male and female gametophytes. We have previously described the isolation and characterisation of the gemini pollen 1 ( gem1 ) that acts gametophytically to disturb asymmetric division and cytokinesis at pollen mitosis I in Arabidopsis . Here we describe the genetic and cytological analysis of an independent gametophytic mutant, gem2, with similar characteristics to gem1, but which maps to a different genetic locus. gem2 shows reduced genetic transmission through both male and female gametes and leads to the production of divided or twin-celled pollen. Developmental analysis revealed that gem2 does not affect karyokinesis at pollen mitosis I, but leads to repositioning of the cell plate and partial or complete failure of cytokinesis, resulting in symmetrical divisions or binucleate pollen grains respectively. Symmetrical divisions lead to altered pollen cell fate with both sister cells displaying vegetative cell fate. Moreover, we demonstrate that the predominant female defect in gem2 is a lack of cellularization of the embryo sac during megagametogenesis. GEM2 therefore defines an independent genetic locus that is involved in the correct specification of both male and female gametophytic cytokinesis. ",Sexual plant reproduction,ANIMAL
0.774268894,16933431,Reaching with alien limbs: Visual exposure to prosthetic hands in a mirror biases proprioception without accompanying illusions of ownership," In five experiments, we investigated the effects of visual exposure to a real hand, a rubber hand, or a wooden block on reaching movements made with the unseen left hand behind a parasagittal mirror. Participants reached from one of four starting positions, corresponding to four levels of conflict between the proprioceptively- and visually-specified position of the reaching hand. Reaching movements were affected most by exposure to the real hand, intermediately by the rubber hand, and least of all by the wooden block. When the posture and/or movement of the visible hand was incompatible with that of the reaching hand, the effect on reaching was reduced. A ‚Äòrubber hand illusion‚Äô questionnaire revealed that illusions of ownership of the rubber hand were not strongly correlated with reaching performance. This research suggests that proprioception recalibrates following visual exposure to prosthetic hands, and that this recalibration is independent of the rubber hand illusion.

0.525564408,16032401,Visual bias of unseen hand position with a mirror: Spatial and temporal factors," Two experiments examined the integration of visual and proprioceptive information concerning the location of an unseen hand, using a mirror positioned along the midsagittal plane. In Experiment 1, participants tapped the fingers of both hands in synchrony, while viewing the mirror-reflection of their left hand. After 6s, participants made reaching movements to a target with their unseen right hand behind the mirror. Reaches were accurate when visually- and proprioceptively-specified hand positions were congruent prior to the reach, but significantly biased by vision when the visual location conflicted with the real location. This effect was independent of the target location and depended strongly upon the relative position of the mirror-reflected hand. In Experiment 2, participants made reaching movements following 4, 8, or 12s active visuomotor or passive visual exposure to the mirror, or following passive exposure without the mirror. Reaching was biased more by the visual location following active visuomotor compared to passive visual exposure, and this bias increased with the duration of visual exposure. These results suggest that the felt position of the hand depends upon an integrated, weighted sum of visual and proprioceptive information. Visual information is weighted more strongly under active visuomotor than passive visual exposure, and with increasing exposure duration to the mirror reflected hand.

Recently, we developed a technique, called ‚Äúbioskiving‚Äù to create novel 2D and 3D constructs from decellularized tendon, using a combination of mechanical sectioning, and layered stacking and rolling. The unidirectionally aligned collagen nanofibers (derived from sections of decellularized tendon) offer good mechanical properties to the constructs compared with those fabricated from reconstituted collagen.    Methods  In this paper, we studied the effect that several variables have on the mechanical properties of structures fabricated from tendon slices, including crosslinking density and the orientation in which the fibers are stacked.    Results  We observed that following stacking and crosslinking, the strength of the constructs is significantly improved, with crosslinked sections having an ultimate tens ile strength over 20 times greater than non-crosslinked samples, and a modulus nearly 50 times higher. The mechanism of the mechanical failure mode of the tendon constructs with or without crosslinking was also investigated.    Conclusions  The strength and fiber organization, combined with the ability to introduce transversely isotropic mechanical properties makes the laminar tendon composites a biocompatiable material that may find future use in a number of biomedical and tissue engineering applications.

0.117473047,24935925,Tryptophan Catabolism Restricts IFN-Œ≥-expressing Neutrophils and  Clostridium difficile  Immunopathology," The interplay between Clostridium difficile and the host's metabolome is believed to influence the severity of infection. However, the mechanism for this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study we model one of these metabolic pathways by focussing on tryptophan metabolism in the host. We found that inhibition of tryptophan catabolism in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) knockout mice led to increased mucosal destruction and cecal haemorrhage, increased production of IFNŒ≥ in response to C. difficile infection, but no significant change in mucosal effector or regulatory T cell numbers or IL-10 mRNA expression. The increased immunopathology in infected IDO1 knockout mice was associated with a lower Clostridium difficile burden and an increased percentage of IFNŒ≥-expressing neutrophils. We further demonstrated the ability of kynurenine to induce apoptosis in bone marrow-derived neutrophils while the presence of tryptophan reversed this effect, providing a possible mechanism for the increased neutrophil accumulation in IDO1 -/- mice. We conclude that Clostridium difficile induces tryptophan catabolism in cecal lamina propria cells, which restricts Clostridium difficile -associated immunopathology and the accumulation of IFNŒ≥-expressing neutrophils. This might represent a self-regulatory mechanism for neutrophils, via the IFNŒ≥-IDO1 pathway, to restrict their own accumulation during infection. These findings have important clinical implications as IDO inhibitors are currently used to treat cancer in clinical trials (in patients particularly susceptible to getting Clostridium difficile infection) and treatment with IDO1 inhibitors may exacerbate the severity of Clostridium difficile colitis.

This paper uses the methodology of Conversation Analysis to examine how psychiatrists justify their psychiatric treatment recommendations to clients. The analysis is based on audio-recordings of interactions between clients with severe mental illnesses (such as, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, etc.) in a long-term, outpatient intensive community treatment program and their psychiatrist. Our focus is on how practitioners design their accounts (or rationales) for recommending for or against changes in medication type and dosage and the interactional deployment of these accounts. We find that psychiatrists use two different types of accounts: they tailor their recommendations to the clients‚Äô concerns and needs ( client-attentive accounts ) and ground their recommendations in their professional expertise ( authority-based accounts ). Even though psychiatrists have the institutional mandate to prescribe medications, we show how the use of accounts displays psychiatrists‚Äô orientation to building consensus with clients in achieving medical decisions by balancing medical authority with the sensitivity to the treatment relationship.

Rapid detection of the malaria parasite and early treatment of infection still remain the most important goals of disease management. Therefore, performance characteristics of the new indigenous ParaHIT f test (Span diagnostic Ltd, Surat, India) was determined among ethnic tribal population in four districts of different transmission potential in central India to assess whether this rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could be widely applied as a diagnostic tool to control malaria. Beyond diagnosis, the logical utilization of RDTs is to monitor treatment outcome. Methods A finger prick blood sample was collected from each clinically suspected case of malaria to prepare blood smear and for testing with the RDT after taking informed consent. The blood smears were read by an experienced technician blinded to the RDT results and clinical status of the subjects. The figures for specificity, sensitivity, accuracy and predictive values were calculated using microscopy as gold standard. Results The prevalence of malaria infection estimated by RDT in parallel with microscopy provide evidence of the type of high, low or no transmission in the study area. Analysis revealed (pooled data of all four epidemiological settings) that overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the RDT were >90% in areas of different endemicity. While, RDT is useful to confirm the diagnosis of new symptomatic cases of suspected P. falciparum infection, the persistence of parasite antigen leading to false positives even after clearance of asexual parasitaemia has limited its utility as a prognostic tool. Conclusion The study showed that the ParaHIT f test was easy to use, reliable and cheap. Thus this RDT is an appropriate test for the use in the field by paramedical staff when laboratory facilities are not available and thus likely to contribute greatly to an effective control of malaria in resource poor countries.",BMC infectious diseases,IMMUN

This is not a trivial task due to the large number of molecular mass 302 Da isomers with very similar chromatographic elution times and similar, possibly even virtually identical, mass fragmentation patterns. The method presented here is based on 4.2 K laser-excited time-resolved Shpol'skii spectroscopy, a high resolution spectroscopic technique with the appropriate selectivity for the unambiguous determination of PAHs with the same molecular mass. The potential of this approach is demonstrated here with the analysis of a coal tar standard reference material (SRM) 1597a. Liquid chromatography fractions were submitted to the spectroscopic analysis of five targeted isomers, namely dibenzo[ a,l ]pyrene, dibenzo[ a,e ]pyrene, dibenzo[ a,i ]pyrene, naphtho[ 2,3-a ]pyrene and dibenzo[ a,h ]pyrene. Prior to analyte determination, the liquid chromatographic fractions were pre-concentrated with gold nanoparticles. Complete analysis was possible with microliters of chromatographic fractions and organic solvents. The limits of detection varied from 0.05 (dibenzo[ a,l ]pyrene) to 0.24 Œºg L ‚àí1 (dibenzo[ a,e ]pyrene). The excellent analytical figures of merit associated to its non-destructive nature, which provides ample opportunity for further analysis with other instrumental methods, makes this approach an attractive alternative for the determination of PAH isomers in complex environmental samples.

In an attentional cueing paradigm, threat words and angry faces had no advantage over positive or neutral words (or faces) in attracting attention to their own location, even for people who were highly state-anxious. In contrast, the presence of threatening cues (words and faces) had a strong impact on the disengagement of attention. When a threat cue was presented and a target subsequently presented in another location, high state-anxious individuals took longer to detect the target relative to when either a positive or a neutral cue was presented. It is concluded that threat-related stimuli affect attentional dwell time and the disengage component of attention, leaving the question of whether threat stimuli affect the shift component of attention open to debate.

Understanding the complete dynamic response of surface structure and chemistry to thermal treatments at the atomic scale is imperative for the rational design of catalyst nanoparticles. Here, by tracking the same individual Pt 3 Co nanoparticles during in situ annealing in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we directly discern five distinct stages of surface elemental rearrangements in Pt 3 Co nanoparticles at the atomic scale: initial random (alloy) elemental distribution; surface platinum-skin-layer formation; nucleation of structurally ordered domains; ordered framework development and, finally, initiation of amorphization. Furthermore, a comprehensive interplay among phase evolution, surface faceting and elemental inter-diffusion is revealed, and supported by atomistic simulations. This work may pave the way towards designing catalysts through post-synthesis annealing for optimized catalytic performance.  Post-synthesis annealing can tailor surface configurations of nanoparticles. Here, the authors use in situ aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to track the evolution of individual alloyed metal nanoparticles at atomic scale and discern five distinct stages of surface rearrangement.",Nature communications,CHEM
0.548837479,17258908,Diffusion Tensor Imaging of  Post Mortem  Multiple Sclerosis Brain," Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being used to probe the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelinating disease. Conventional T 2 -weighted MRI (cMRI) largely fails to predict the degree of patients' disability. This shortcoming may be due to poor specificity of cMRI for clinically relevant pathology. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise to be more specific for MS pathology. In this study we investigated the association between histological indices of myelin content, axonal count and gliosis, and two measures of DTI (mean diffusivity [MD] and fractional anisotropy [FA]), in unfixed post mortem MS brain using a 1.5-T MR system. Both MD and FA were significantly lower in post mortem MS brain compared to published data acquired in vivo . However, the differences of MD and FA described in vivo between white matter lesions (WMLs) and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) were retained in this study of post mortem brain: average MD in WMLs was 0.35√ó10 ‚àí3 mm 2 /s (SD, 0.09) versus 0.22 (0.04) in NAWM; FA was 0.22 (0.06) in WMLs versus 0.38 (0.13) in NAWM. Correlations were detected between myelin content (Tr myelin ) and (i) FA ( r =‚àí0.79, p <0.001), (ii) MD ( r =0.68, p <0.001), and (iii) axonal count ( r =‚àí0.81, p <0.001). Multiple regression suggested that these correlations largely explain the apparent association of axonal count with (i) FA ( r =0.70, p <0.001) and (ii) MD ( r =‚àí0.66, p <0.001). In conclusion, this study suggests that FA and MD are affected by myelin content and ‚Äì to a lesser degree ‚Äì axonal count in post mortem MS brain. ",NeuroImage,NEURO
0.770294136,31360765,Unconventional quantum optics in topological waveguide QED,"Topological one-dimensional photons induce exotic and tunable quantum emitter dynamics and interactions. The discovery of topological materials has motivated recent developments to export topological concepts into photonics to make light behave in exotic ways. Here, we predict several unconventional quantum optical phenomena that occur when quantum emitters interact with a topological waveguide quantum electrodynamics bath, namely, the photonic analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. When the emitters‚Äô frequency lies within the topological bandgap, a chiral bound state emerges, which is located on just one side (right or left) of the emitter. In the presence of several emitters, this bound state mediates topological, tunable interactions between them, which can give rise to exotic many-body phases such as double N√©el ordered states. Furthermore, when the emitters‚Äô optical transition is resonant with the bands, we find unconventional scattering properties and different super/subradiant states depending on the band topology. Last, we propose several implementations where these phenomena can be observed with state-of-the-art technology.",Science advances,CHEM

Patients and Methods We conducted centralized immunohistochemical staining, semi-quantitative scoring, and survival analysis in 5263 patients participating in the Ovarian Tumor Tissue Analysis consortium. Patients were diagnosed between January 1, 1978, and December 31, 2014, including 2865 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs), with more than 12,000 person-years of follow-up time. Tissue microarrays were stained for MyD88 and TLR4, and staining intensity was classified using a 2-tiered system for each marker (weak vs strong). Results Expression of MyD88 and TLR4 was similar in all histotypes except clear cell ovarian cancer, which showed reduced expression compared with other histotypes ( P <.001 for both). In HGSOC, strong MyD88 expression was modestly associated with shortened overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01‚Äì1.26; P =.04) but was also associated with advanced stage ( P <.001). The expression of TLR4 was not associated with survival. In low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC), strong expression of both MyD88 and TLR4 was associated with favorable survival (HR [95% CI], 0.49 [0.29‚Äì0.84] and 0.44 [0.21‚Äì0.89], respectively; P =.009 and P =.02, respectively). Conclusion Results are consistent with an association between strong MyD88 staining and advanced stage and poorer survival in HGSOC and demonstrate correlation between strong MyD88 and TLR4 staining and improved survival in LGSOC, highlighting the biological differences between the 2 serous histotypes.",Mayo Clinic proceedings,ONCO
0.685683136,29288257,Predictors of blood volatile organic compound levels in Gulf coast residents," To address concerns among Gulf Coast residents about ongoing exposures to volatile organic compounds, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, and m-/p- xylene (BTEX), we characterized current blood levels and identified predictors of BTEX among Gulf state residents.  We collected questionnaire data on recent exposures and measured blood BTEX levels in a convenience sample of 718 Gulf residents. Because BTEX is rapidly cleared from the body, blood levels represent recent exposures in the past 24 hours. We compared participants‚Äô levels of blood BTEX to a nationally representative sample. Among nonsmokers we assessed predictors of blood BTEX levels using linear regression, and predicted the risk of elevated BTEX levels using modified Poisson regression.  Blood BTEX levels in Gulf residents were similar to national levels. Among nonsmokers, sex and reporting recent smoky/chemical odors predicted blood BTEX. The change in log benzene was ‚àí0.26 (95% CI: ‚àí0.47, ‚àí0.04) and 0.72 (0.02, 1.42) for women and those who reported odors, respectively. Season, time spent away from home, and self-reported residential proximity to Superfund sites (within a half mile) were statistically associated with benzene only, however mean concentration was nearly an order of magnitude below that of cigarette smokers.  Among these Gulf residents, smoking was the primary contributor to blood BTEX levels, but other factors were also relevant. ",Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,ENVIRON
0.239735536,19433514,PEP-FOLD: an online resource for  de novo  peptide structure prediction,"Rational peptide design and large-scale prediction of peptide structure from sequence remain a challenge for chemical biologists. We present PEP-FOLD, an online service, aimed at de novo modelling of 3D conformations for peptides between 9 and 25 amino acids in aqueous solution. Using a hidden Markov model-derived structural alphabet (SA) of 27 four-residue letters, PEP-FOLD first predicts the SA letter profiles from the amino acid sequence and then assembles the predicted fragments by a greedy procedure driven by a modified version of the OPEP coarse-grained force field. Starting from an amino acid sequence, PEP-FOLD performs series of 50 simulations and returns the most representative conformations identified in terms of energy and population. Using a benchmark of 25 peptides with 9‚Äì23 amino acids, and considering the reproducibility of the runs, we find that, on average, PEP-FOLD locates lowest energy conformations differing by 2.6 √Ö CŒ± root mean square deviation from the full NMR structures.

0.436766712,17365855,MINIMAL REGULATION OF PLATELET ACTIVITY BY PECAM-1,"  OBJECTIVES  PECAM-1 is a member of the superfamily of immunoglobulins (Ig) and is expressed on platelets at moderate level. PECAM-1 has been reported to have contrasting effects on platelet activation by the collagen receptor GPVI and the integrin, Œ± IIb Œ≤ 3 , even though both receptors signal through Src-kinase regulation of PLCŒ≥2. The present study compares the role of PECAM-1 on platelet activation by these two receptors and by the lectin receptor, CLEC-2, which also signals via PLCŒ≥2.    METHODS & RESULTS  Studies using PECAM-1 knockout-mice and cross-linking of PECAM-1 using specific antibodies demonstrated a minor inhibitory role on platelet responses to the above three receptors and also under some conditions to the G-protein agonist thrombin. The degree of inhibition was considerably less than that produced by PGI 2 , which elevates cAMP. There was no significant difference in thrombus formation on collagen in PECAM-1 ‚àí/‚àí platelets relative to litter-matched controls.    CONCLUSIONS  The very weak inhibitory effect of PECAM-1 on platelet activation relative to that of PGI 2 indicate that the Ig-receptor is not a major regulator of platelet activation.

0.42032115,29875749,Effects of Ice-Algal Aggregate Export on the Connectivity of Bacterial Communities in the Central Arctic Ocean,"In summer 2012, Arctic sea ice declined to a record minimum and, as a consequence of the melting, large amounts of aggregated ice-algae sank to the seafloor at more than 4,000 m depth. In this study, we assessed the composition, turnover and connectivity of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities across Arctic habitats from sea ice, algal aggregates and surface waters to the seafloor. Eukaryotic communities were dominated by diatoms, dinoflagellates and other alveolates in all samples, and showed highest richness and diversity in sea-ice habitats (‚àº400‚Äì500 OTUs). Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria were the predominant bacterial classes across all investigated Arctic habitats. Bacterial community richness and diversity peaked in deep-sea samples (‚àº1,700 OTUs). Algal aggregate-associated bacterial communities were mainly recruited from the sea-ice community, and were transported to the seafloor with the sinking ice algae. The algal deposits at the seafloor had a unique community structure, with some shared sequences with both the original sea-ice community (22% OTU overlap), as well as with the deep-sea sediment community (17% OTU overlap). We conclude that ice-algal aggregate export does not only affect carbon export from the surface to the seafloor, but may change microbial community composition in central Arctic habitats with potential effects for benthic ecosystem functioning in the future.",Frontiers in microbiology,ECO
0.71598377,15466863,GSK-3 Phosphorylation of the Alzheimer Epitope within Collapsin Response Mediator Proteins Regulates Axon Elongation in Primary Neurons *," Elevated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity is associated with Alzheimer disease. We have found that collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMP) 2 and 4 are physiological substrates of GSK-3. The amino acids targeted by GSK-3 comprise a hyperphosphorylated epitope first identified in plaques isolated from Alzheimer brain. Expression of wild type CRMP2 in primary hippocampal neurons or SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells promotes axon elongation. However, a GSK-3-insensitive CRMP2 mutant has dramatically reduced ability to promote axon elongation, a similar effect to pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3. Hence, we propose that phosphorylation of CRMP proteins by GSK-3 regulates axon elongation. This work provides a direct connection between hyperphosphorylation of these residues and elevated GSK-3 activity, both of which are observed in Alzheimer brain.

0.446801696,24882928,Anterior canal BPPV and apogeotropic posterior canal BPPV: two rare forms of vertical canalolithiasis,"SUMMARY Posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent form of BPPV. It is characterized by a paroxysmal positioning nystagmus evoked through Dix-Hallpike and Semont positioning tests. Anterior canal BPPV (AC) is more rare than posterior canal BPPV; it presents a prevalent down beating positioning nystagmus, with a torsional component clockwise for the left canal, counterclockwise for the right canal. Due to the possible lack of the torsional component, it is sometimes difficult to identify the affected ear. An apogeotropic variant of posterior BPPV (APC) has recently been described, characterised by a paroxysmal positional nystagmus in the opposite direction to the one evoked in posterior canal BPPV: the linear component is down-beating, the torsional component is clockwise for the right canal, counter-clockwise for the left canal, so that a contra-lateral anterior canal BPPV could be simulated. During a 16 month period, of 934 BPPV patients observed, the authors identified 23 (2.5%) cases of apogeotropic posterior canal BPPV and 11 (1.2%) cases of anterior canal BPPV, diagnosed using the specific oculomotor patterns described in the literature. Anterior canal BPPV was treated with the repositioning manoeuvre proposed by Yacovino, which does not require identification of the affected side, whereas apogeotropic posterior canal BPPV was treated with the Quick Liberatory Rotation manoeuvre for the typical posterior canal BPPV, since in the Dix-Hallpike position otoliths are in the same position if they come either from the ampullary arm or from the non-ampullary arm. The direct resolution of BPPV ( one step therapy ) was obtained in 12/34 patients, 8/23 patients with APC and 4/11 patients with AC; canalar conversion into typical posterior canal BPPV, later treated through Quick Liberatory Rotation ( two-step therapy ), was obtained in 19 patients,14/23 with APC and 5/11 with AC. Three patients were lost to follow-up. Considering the effects of therapeutic manoeuvres, the authors propose a grading system for diagnosis of AC and APC: ""certain"" when a canalar conversion in ipsilateral typical posterior canal BPPV is obtained; ""probable"" when APC or AC are directly resolved; ""possible"" when disease is not resolved and cerebral neuroimaging is negative for neurological diseases. Our results show that the oculomotor patterns proposed in the literature are effective in diagnosing APC and AC, and that APC is more frequent than AC. Both of these rare forms of vertical canal BPPV can be treated effectively with liberatory manoeuvres.",Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale,CLINIC

Hib immunization was introduced in Kenyan infants in 2001.    Objective  to define invasive Hib disease incidence and Hib vaccine program effectiveness.    Design, Setting, Patients  culture-based surveillance for invasive Hib disease at Kilifi District Hospital from 2000 to 2005 was linked to demographic surveillance of 38,000 children aged <5 years in Kilifi District, Kenya. HIV infection and Hib vaccination status were determined for children with Hib disease admitted 2002 ‚Äì 2005.    Interventions  Conjugate Hib vaccine within the routine childhood immunization program at ages 6, 10 and 14 weeks from November 2001    Main outcome measures  Incidence of culture-proven Hib invasive disease before and after vaccine introduction and vaccine program effectiveness (1-incidence rate ratio)    Results  Prior to vaccine introduction the median age of Hib cases was 8 months; case fatality was 23%. Among children aged <5 years the annual incidence of invasive Hib disease 1 year before and 1 and 3 years after vaccine introduction was 66, 47 and 7.6 per 100,000, respectively. For children <2 years, incidence was 119, 82 and 16, respectively. In 2004 ‚Äì 2005 vaccine effectiveness was 88% (95% CI 73 ‚Äì 96%) among children <5 years and 87% (95% CI 66 ‚Äì 96%) among children <2 years.

Patients and Methods  Institutional records of MRI-US fusion-guided biopsy were reviewed. Detection rates for all cancers, Gleason ‚â•3 + 4 cancers, and Gleason ‚â•4 + 3 cancers were computed. Agreement between axial and sagittal cores for cancer detection, and frequency where one was upgraded the other was computed on a per-target and per-patient basis.    Results  In all, 893 encounters from 791 patients that underwent MRI-US fusion-guided biopsy in 2007‚Äì2013 were reviewed, yielding 4688 biopsy cores from 2344 targets for analysis. The mean age and PSA level at each encounter was 61.8 years and9.7 ng/mL (median 6.45 ng/mL). Detection rates for all cancers, ‚â•3 + 4 cancers, and ‚â•4 + 3 cancers were 25.9%, 17.2%, and 8.1% for axial cores, and 26.1%, 17.6%, and 8.6% for sagittal cores. Per-target agreement was 88.6%, 93.0%, and 96.5%, respectively. On a per-target basis, the rates at which one core upgraded or detected a cancer missed on the other were 8.3% and 8.6% for axial and sagittal cores, respectively. Even with the inclusion of systematic biopsies, omission of axial or sagittal cores would have resulted in missed detection or under-characterisation of cancer in 4.7% or 5.2% of patients, respectively.    Conclusion  Cancer detection rates, Gleason scores, and core involvement from axial and sagittal cores are similar, but significant cancer may be missed if only one core is obtained for each target. Discordance between axial and sagittal cores is greatest in intermediate-risk scenarios, where obtaining multiple cores may improve tissue characterisation.  ",BJU international,ONCO
0.271211793,25314051,Time dependence of biomarkers: non-proportional effects of immunohistochemical panels predicting relapse risk in early breast cancer,"Background: We investigated the impact of follow-up duration to determine whether two immunohistochemical prognostic panels, IHC4 and Mammostrat, provide information on the risk of early or late distant recurrence using the Edinburgh Breast Conservation Series and the Tamoxifen vs Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial. Methods: The multivariable fractional polynomial time (MFPT) algorithm was used to determine which variables had possible non-proportional effects. The performance of the scores was assessed at various lengths of follow-up and Cox regression modelling was performed over the intervals of 0‚Äì5 years and >5 years. Results: We observed a strong time dependence of both the IHC4 and Mammostrat scores, with their effects decreasing over time. In the first 5 years of follow-up only, the addition of both scores to clinical factors provided statistically significant information ( P <0.05), with increases in R 2 between 5 and 6% and increases in D-statistic between 0.16 and 0.21. Conclusions: Our analyses confirm that the IHC4 and Mammostrat scores are strong prognostic factors for time to distant recurrence but this is restricted to the first 5 years after diagnosis. This provides evidence for their combined use to predict early recurrence events in order to select those patients who may/will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.",British journal of cancer,ONCO

In the present paper, we studied heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) involvement in this mechanism. Methods: HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell migration and invasion were studied in artificial wound assay and modified Boyden chamber assay, respectively. Heat-shock protein 90 was studied by western blot and immunofluorescence. Matrix metalloproteinase‚Äì2 and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) were studied by gelatin¬±plasminogen zymography and immunofluorescence. Heat-shock protein 90 partners were studied by immunoprecipitation. Messenger RNA expression was studied using real-time PCR. Small interfering RNAs were used to confirm the essential role of Hsp90. Results: We showed that kappa-elastin and VGVAPG elastin hexapeptide stimulated Hsp90, pro-MMP-2 and uPA secretion within 6‚Äâh, whereas AGVPGLGVG and GRKRK peptides had no effect. No increase of mRNA level was observed. Heat-shock protein 90-specific inhibitors inhibit EDP-stimulated HT-1080 cell-invasive capacity and restrained EDP-stimulated pro-MMP-2 and uPA secretions. The inhibitory effect was reproduced by using Hsp90-blocking antibody or Hsp90 knockdown by siRNA. Heat-shock protein 90 interacted with and stabilised uPA and pro-MMP-2 in conditioned culture media of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Conclusions: Taken together, our results demonstrate that EDPs exert protumoural activities through an Hsp90-dependent mechanism involving pro-MMP-2 and uPA.",British journal of cancer,ONCO

Methods  Both self-rated general and mental health status were assessed using data from a cross-sectional survey of 1869 women conducted in 2003. Associations between self-rated general and mental health status and cultural capital were obtained using œá 2 tests and odds ratios from binary logistic regression models.    Results  Cultural capital had significant associations with self-perceived general and mental health status net of the effects of social capital, SES, demographics, community and health risk factors.

As expected, health risk factors were significantly associated with both measures of health status. However, demographic and community variables were associated with general health, but not with mental health status. The findings pertaining to social capital and measures of SES were mixed.

0.204890992,26365738,Carbonic anhydrase generates a pH gradient in  Bombyx mori  silk glands," Silk is a protein of interest to both biological and industrial sciences. The silkworm, Bombyx mori , forms this protein into strong threads starting from soluble silk proteins using a number of biochemical and physical cues to allow the transition from liquid to fibrous silk. A pH gradient has been measured along the gland, but the methodology employed was not able to precisely determine the pH at specific regions of interest in the silk gland. Furthermore, the physiological mechanisms responsible for the generation of this pH gradient are unknown.  In this study, concentric ion selective microelectrodes were used to determine the luminal pH of Bombyx mori silk glands. A gradient from pH 8.2 to 7.2 was measured in the posterior silk gland, with a pH 7 throughout the middle silk gland, and a gradient from pH 6.8 to 6.2 in the beginning of the anterior silk gland where silk processing into fibers occurs. The small diameter of the most anterior region of the anterior silk gland prevented microelectrode access in this region. Using a histochemical method, the presence of active carbonic anhydrase was identified in the funnel and anterior silk gland of fifth instar larvae. The observed pH gradient collapsed upon addition of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor methazolamide, confirming an essential role for this enzyme in pH regulation in the Bombyx mori silk gland. Plastic embedding of whole silk glands allowed clear visualization of the morphology, including the identification of four distinct epithelial cell types in the gland and allowed correlations between silk gland morphology and silk stages of assembly related to the pH gradient.  Bombyx mori silk glands have four different epithelial cell types, one of which produces carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anhydrase is necessary for the mechanism that generates an intraluminal pH gradient, which likely regulates the assembly of silk proteins and then the formation of fibers from soluble silk proteins. These new insights into native silk formation may lead to a more efficient production of artificial or regenerated silkworm silk fibers.

Many studies have been conducted on patients‚Äô preferences in choosing their health care provider, but the majority of them were conducted in modern western societies, establishing a need to explore other populations. The present study was performed in the Israeli Druze community which is composed of a uniquely traditional and religious population. We assessed the sex preference of Israeli Druze women regarding obstetricians/gynecologists, and identify other features that affect their choice. Method We conducted a cross-sectional study that included 196 Israeli Druze women who anonymously completed a 36-item questionnaire between January-July, 2011. Results Most (63.8%) of the responders preferred female obstetricians/gynecologists, while 74.5% had no sex preference for their family physicians. 68.6% of the religious women preferred female obstetricians/gynecologists as compared to 51.76% of those women who self-identified as secular. Most of the women (65%) preferred female obstetricians/gynecologists for intimate procedures, such as pelvic examination and pregnancy follow-up. The main reasons given were: feeling more comfortable with a female practitioner (69.7%), the belief that females are more gentle (56.6%), and being more embarrassed with male obstetricians/gynecologists (45.4%). Three factors were associated with the responders‚Äô preferences for female obstetricians/gynecologists: their age and religious status, and the sex of their regular obstetricians/gynecologists. Women who preferred a female obstetrician/gynecologist assigned a lesser weight to the physician‚Äôs knowledge when choosing them. Older and religious women as well as those who attributed less weight to the physician‚Äôs professional knowledge were more likely to prefer a female obstetrician/gynecologist. Conclusions The majority of responders to our survey (Israeli Druze women), like those in other communities where religiousness and modesty are deeply rooted, prefer female obstetricians/gynecologists, with the overwhelming reasons given being feeling more comfortable and less embarrassed with females, and the notion that female obstetricians/gynecologists are more gentle during intimate procedures.",Israel journal of health policy research,EPIDEM
0.697883877,26280020,High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid differentially influence macrophage activation," Macrophages exhibit phenotypic diversity permitting wide-ranging roles in maintaining physiologic homeostasis. Hyaluronic acid, a major glycosaminoglycan of the extracellular matrix, has been shown to have differential signaling based on its molecular weight. With this in mind, the main objective of this study was to elucidate the role of hyaluronic acid molecular weight on macrophage activation and reprogramming. Changes in macrophage activation were assessed by activation state selective marker measurement, specifically quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, and cytokine enzyme-linked immunoassays, after macrophage treatment with differing molecular weights of hyaluronic acid under four conditions: the resting state, concurrent with classical activation, and following inflammation involving either classically or alternatively activated macrophages. Regardless of initial polarization state, low molecular weight hyaluronic acid induced a classically activated-like state, confirmed by up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes, including nos2 , tnf , il12b , and cd80 , and enhanced secretion of nitric oxide and TNF-Œ±. High molecular weight hyaluronic acid promoted an alternatively activated-like state, confirmed by up regulation of pro-resolving gene transcription, including arg1 , il10 , and mrc1 , and enhanced arginase activity. Overall, our observations suggest that macrophages undergo phenotypic changes dependent on molecular weight of hyaluronan that correspond to either (1) pro-inflammatory response for low molecular weight HA or (2) pro-resolving response for high molecular weight HA. These observations bring significant further understanding of the influence of extracellular matrix polymers, hyaluronic acid in particular, on regulating the inflammatory response of macrophages. This knowledge can be used to guide the design of HA-containing biomaterials to better utilize the natural response to HAs. ",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,ENG
0.605244015,30880836,Benthic microalgae serve as the major food resource for porcelain crabs ( Petrolisthes  spp.) in oyster reefs: gut content and pigment evidence 1, Suspension-feeding porcelain crabs ( Petrolisthes spp.) are often the most abundant decapod crustaceans in oyster reef habitat. Analysis of water column and subtidal algal biomass from three Texas estuaries suggests that planktonic food resources are insufficient for porcelain crab growth. Pigment composition of porcelain crab muscle and digestive track contents included the diatom pigment fucoxanthin and cyanobacterial pigment canthaxanthin with digestive track samples containing attached (adnate) benthic diatoms as well as benthic cyanobacteria not found in the water column. Feeding appendages on porcelain crabs include numerous cirri with serrated edges as well as fewer more brush-like longer units. Benthic food resources are in sufficient supply to support porcelain crab biomass. ,Journal of experimental marine biology and ecology,ANIMAL

TGF-Œ≤ and Notch signaling pathways play important roles in regulating self-renewal of stem cells, cell-fate determination. Both pathways are frequently implicated in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. However, their contributions to esophageal adenocarcinoma remain unclear.    Methods  We evaluated TGF-Œ≤ and Notch signaling components in normal esophagus, Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma tissues and cell lines by IHC and immunoblotting; Hes-1 transcription was assayed using a Hes-1 luciferase reporter.    Results  We demonstrate loss of Smad4 (p<0.05), and Œ≤2SP (p<0.01) in 5/10 Barrett's and 17/22 adenocarcinoma tissue sections. Concomitantly, dramatically raised levels of Notch signaling components Hes1 and Jagged1 occur in adenocarcinomas tissues and cell lines, compared to normal tissues. In normal esophagus, Oct3/4 positive cells are located in the basal layer (2-3 per cluster), representing a pool of progenitor cells. We observed an expansion of this pool of Oct3/4 positive cells in esophageal adenocarcinoma (15 per cluster). Furthermore, a panel of SOXs proteins documented for stem cell markers exhibit increased expression in tumor cells indicating expansion of putative cancer stem cells. Finally, we find growth inhibition in BE3 cells with a Œ≥-secretase inhibitor (GSIXXI), but not in SKGT-4 cells. Unlike SKGT-4 cells, BE3 cells have activated Notch signaling with disruption of TGF-Œ≤ signaling.    Conclusions  Our study demonstrates a potential therapeutic value for targeted therapy in esophageal adenocarcinoma in the setting of loss of Œ≤2SP/TGF-Œ≤ with concomitant constitutively active Notch signaling.

0.900503998,29075195,Falls and Fall-Prevention in Older Persons: Geriatrics Meets Spaceflight!,"This paper provides a general overview of key physiological consequences of microgravity experienced during spaceflight and of important parallels and connections to the physiology of aging. Microgravity during spaceflight influences cardiovascular function, cerebral autoregulation, musculoskeletal, and sensorimotor system performance. A great deal of research has been carried out to understand these influences and to provide countermeasures to reduce the observed negative consequences of microgravity on physiological function. Such research can inform and be informed by research related to physiological changes and the deterioration of physiological function due to aging. For example, head-down bedrest is used as a model to study effects of spaceflight deconditioning due to reduced gravity. As hospitalized older persons spend up to 80% of their time in bed, the deconditioning effects of bedrest confinement on physiological functions and parallels with spaceflight deconditioning can be exploited to understand and combat both variations of deconditioning. Deconditioning due to bed confinement in older persons can contribute to a downward spiral of increasing frailty, orthostatic intolerance, falls, and fall-related injury. As astronauts in space spend substantial amounts of time carrying out exercise training to counteract the microgravity-induced deconditioning and to counteract orthostatic intolerance on return to Earth, it is logical to suggest some of these interventions for bed-confined older persons. Synthesizing knowledge regarding deconditioning due to reduced gravitational stress in space and deconditioning during bed confinement allows for a more comprehensive approach that can incorporate aspects such as (mal-) nutrition, muscle strength and function, cardiovascular (de-) conditioning, and cardio-postural interactions. The impact of such integration can provide new insights and lead to methods of value for both space medicine and geriatrics (Geriatrics meets spaceflight!). In particular, such integration can lead to procedures that address the morbidity and the mortality associated with bedrest immobilization and in the rising health care costs associated with an aging population demographic.",Frontiers in physiology,PHYSIO
0.063090243,29312414,"Arabidopsis  Calmodulin-Like Proteins, CML15 and CML16 Possess Biochemical Properties Distinct from Calmodulin and Show Non-overlapping Tissue Expression Patterns","Calcium ions are used as ubiquitous, key second messengers in cells across eukaryotic taxa. In plants, calcium signal transduction is involved in a wide range of cellular processes from abiotic and biotic stress responses to development and growth. Calcium signals are detected by calcium sensor proteins, of which calmodulin (CaM), is the most evolutionarily conserved and well-studied. These sensors regulate downstream targets to propagate the information in signaling pathways. Plants possess a large family of calcium sensors related to CaM, termed CaM-like (CMLs), that are not found in animals and remain largely unstudied at the structural and functional level. Here, we investigated the biochemical properties and gene promoter activity of two closely related members of the Arabidopsis CML family, CML15 and CML16. Biochemical characterization of recombinant CML15 and CML16 indicated that they possess properties consistent with their predicted roles as calcium sensors. In the absence of calcium, CML15 and CML16 display greater intrinsic hydrophobicity than CaM. Both CMLs displayed calcium-dependent and magnesium-independent conformational changes that expose hydrophobic residues, but the degree of hydrophobic exposure was markedly less than that observed for CaM. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated two and three calcium-binding sites for CML15 and CML16, respectively, with affinities expected to be within a physiological range. Both CML15 and CML16 bound calcium with high affinity in the presence of excess magnesium. Promoter-reporter analysis demonstrated that the CML16 promoter is active across a range of Arabidopsis tissues and developmental stages, whereas the CML15 promoter activity is very restricted and was observed only in floral tissues, specifically anthers and pollen. Collectively, our data indicate that these CMLs behave biochemically like calcium sensors but with properties distinct from CaM and likely have non-overlapping roles in floral development. We discuss our findings in the broader context of calcium sensors and signaling in Arabidopsis .",Frontiers in plant science,ANIMAL
0.231410168,18370594,Plasticity in the adult human auditory brainstem following short-term linguistic training," Peripheral and central structures along the auditory pathway contribute to speech processing and learning. However, because speech requires the use of functionally and acoustically complex sounds which necessitates high sensory and cognitive demands, long-term exposure and experience using these sounds is often attributed to the neocortex with little emphasis placed on subcortical structures. The present study examines changes in the auditory brainstem, specifically the frequency following response (FFR), as native English-speaking adults learn to incorporate foreign speech sounds (lexical pitch patterns) in word identification. The FFR presumably originates from the auditory midbrain, and can be elicited pre-attentively. We measured FFRs to the trained pitch patterns before and after training. Measures of pitch-tracking were then derived from the FFR signals. We found increased accuracy in pitch-tracking after training, including a decrease in the number of pitch-tracking errors and a refinement in the energy devoted to encoding pitch. Most interestingly, this change in pitch-tracking accuracy only occurred in the most acoustically complex pitch contour (dipping contour), which is also the least familiar to our English-speaking subjects. These results not only demonstrate the contribution of the brainstem in language learning and its plasticity in adulthood, but they also demonstrate the specificity of this contribution (i.e., changes in encoding only occurs in specific, least familiar stimuli, not all stimuli). Our findings complement existing data showing cortical changes after second language learning, and are consistent with models suggesting that brainstem changes resulting from perceptual learning are most apparent when acuity in encoding is most needed.

Some studies suggest that opium may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke. This study compared carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and cerebrovascular reactivity between opium-dependent and healthy people. Methods This case-control study was done among opium addicts at Shafa hospital in Kerman, Iran, in year 2018. People with systemic disease or who took any medicine were excluded from our study. The control group were selected from healthy non-addicted volunteers. The control group was matched in age and sex with the case group. Cerebrovascular reactivity of middle cranial artery and intima-media thickness of carotid artery were measured for all in both groups. The results were analyzed using chi-square, independent samples t, and logistic regression tests. Findings 47 opium addicts and 47 healthy people entered this study. 88% of them were men and 12% were women. 68.1% of the case group and 31.9% of the control group were cigarette smokers; this difference was statistically significant. Comparison of cerebrovascular reactivity and CIMT between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001). This relationship remained significant for the CIMT after removing confounding factors (P = 0.018). Conclusion Overall, our findings show that opium dependency affects the carotid intima-media thickness as an indicator of cerebral atherosclerosis.",Addiction & health,CLINIC

The objective of this study was to generate 2D/3D soil compaction maps for different depth layers of the soil. To do so, a soil penetrometer was designed, which was mounted on the three-point hitch of an agricultural tractor, consisting of a mechanical system, data acquisition system (DAS), and 2D/3D imaging and analysis software. The system was successfully tested in field conditions, measuring soil penetration resistances as a function of depth from 0 to 40 cm at 1 cm intervals. The software allows user to either tabulate the measured quantities or generate maps as soon as data collection has been terminated. The system may also incorporate GPS data to create geo-referenced soil maps. The software enables the user to graph penetration resistances at a specified coordinate. Alternately, soil compaction maps could be generated using data collected from multiple coordinates. The data could be automatically stratified to determine soil compaction distribution at different layers of 5, 10,.‚Ä¶, 40 cm depths. It was concluded that the system tested in this study could be used to assess the soil compaction at topsoil and the randomly distributed hardpan formations just below the common tillage depths, enabling visualization of spatial variability through the imaging software.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",ENG

HIV dysregulates iron metabolism, but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of iron and iron-transport proteins in HIV-infected (HIV+) persons are largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to characterize CSF iron-related biomarkers in HIV+¬†adults and explore their relationships to known predictors of HAND. Methods We quantified total iron, transferrin and heavy-chain (H)-ferritin by immunoassay in CSF sampled by lumbar puncture in 403 HIV+¬†participants in a multi-center, observational study and evaluated biomarker associations with demographic and HIV-related correlates of HAND [e.g., age, sex, self-reported race/ethnicity, ART, and detectable plasma virus and CSF viral load (VL)] by multivariable regression. In a subset (N¬†=¬†110) with existing CSF: serum albumin (Q Alb ) measurements, Q Alb and comorbidity severity were also included as covariates to account for variability in the blood‚ÄìCSF-barrier. Results Among 403 individuals (median age 43 years, 19% women, 56% non-Whites, median nadir CD4+¬†T cell count 180 cells/¬µL, 46% with undetectable plasma virus), men had 25% higher CSF transferrin (median 18.1 vs. 14.5¬†¬µg/mL), and 71% higher H-ferritin (median 2.9 vs. 1.7¬†ng/mL) than women (both p -values¬†‚â§0.01). CSF iron was 41% higher in self-reported Hispanics and 27% higher in (non-Hispanic) Whites than in (non-Hispanic) Blacks (median 5.2 and 4.7¬†¬µg/dL in Hispanics and Whites, respectively, vs. 3.7¬†¬µg/dL in Blacks, both p ‚â§¬†0.01); these findings persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and HIV-specific factors. Median H-ferritin was 25% higher ( p <¬†0.05), and transferrin 14% higher ( p =¬†0.06), in Whites than Blacks. Transferrin and H-ferritin were 33 and 50% higher, respectively, in older (age¬†>¬†50 years) than in younger persons (age¬†‚â§¬†35 years; both p <¬†0.01), but these findings lost statistical significance in subset analyses that adjusted for Q Alb and comorbidity. After these additional adjustments, associations were observed for CSF iron and transferrin with race/ethnicity as well as CSF VL, for transferrin with sex and ART, and for H-ferritin with plasma virus detectability and significant comorbidity (all p <¬†0.05). Conclusions CSF iron biomarkers are associated with demographic factors, ART, and CSF VL in HIV+¬†adults.

0.788576172,19946622,Mechanisms of interaction in speech production," Many theories predict the presence of interactive effects involving information represented by distinct cognitive processes in speech production. There is considerably less agreement regarding the precise cognitive mechanisms that underlie these interactive effects. For example, are they driven by purely production-internal mechanisms (e.g., Dell, 1986 ) or do they reflect the influence of perceptual monitoring mechanisms on production processes (e.g., Roelofs, 2004 )? Acoustic analyses reveal the phonetic realization of words is influenced by their word-specific properties‚Äîsupporting the presence of interaction between lexical-level and phonetic information in speech production. A second experiment examines what mechanisms are responsible for this interactive effect. The results suggest the effect occurs on-line and is not purely driven by listener modeling.

Complex restorative treatment can replace the lost tooth structure and improve functional occlusal and facial skeleton parameters. Purpose: The aim of the study is to assess changes in the morphological and functional occlusal parameters of the facial skeleton after prosthetic rehabilitation that increased lost occlusal vertical dimension. Material and Methodology: 50 patients with advanced tooth wear were clinically examined, to assess the degree of wear . Each subject underwent cephalometric analysis, digital occlusal analysis, and electromyographic analysis, of the anterior temporalis, superficial masetter, anterior digastric, and the sternocleidomastoid muscles. Prosthodontic treatment was performed to restore the occlusal vertical dimension of each subject‚Äôs occlusion, which was followed by repeating the pretreatment analyses. Pre and post treatment parameters were statistically compared. Results: Pre-treatment cephalometric analysis showed that lost vertical dimension reduced anterior facial height and resulted in small angular skeletal parameters. Post treatment anterior facial height increased from the increased occlusal vertical dimension. The mean value of functional electrical activity during clenching post treatment, increased compared to pretreatment. Conclusion: Increasing the vertical dimension of occlusion improved facial aesthetics by positively affecting facial skeletal angles. The restored occlusal surface morphology changed the pre treatment flat broad occlusal contacts into more point contacts. The increased vertical dimension of occlusion after treatment also increased muscle activity levels over the pretreatment levels after three months period of adaptation.",The open dentistry journal,CLINIC

Obesity has been strongly linked to endometrial cancer (EC) risk. A number of potential EC risk bio-markers have been proposed, including heightened pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines. To evaluate if bariatric surgery can serve as a means for altering levels of such EC risk biomarkers, we investigated changes in these biomarkers after weight loss.    Methods.  Blood samples were collected pre-operatively and 6 months post-operatively in107 female bariatric surgery patients aged 18‚Äì72 years. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare biomarker levels (measured using xMAP immunoassays) pre- and post-surgery. Normative comparisons were implemented to contrast 6-month post-surgery biomarker levels to levels in a sample of 74 age-matched non-obese women. Linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between biomarker expression at baseline and 6 months post-surgery and the relationship between race and biomarker levels.    Results.  On average, participants lost 30.15 kg (SD: 12.26) after the bariatric intervention. Levels of C-peptide, insulin, CRP, leptin, IL-1RŒ±, and IL-6 significantly decreased, while levels of SHBG, IGFBP1, and adiponectin significantly increased with weight loss. Normative comparisons showed the levels of SHBG, C-peptide, insulin, IGFBP1, adiponectin, CRP, and TNFŒ± after bariatric intervention approached the level of markers in comparison group. Multiple regression analyses revealed significant relationships between changes in BMI and changes in biomarker levels. The changes in IL-1RŒ± were significantly associated with race.    Conclusions.  Our findings demonstrate that normalization of EC risk biomarkers can be achieved with bariatric surgery. Improved understanding of biological mechanisms associated with weight loss may inform preventive strategies for EC.  ",Gynecologic oncology,ONCO

0.221388074,26975550,The First Day is Always the Hardest: Functional Connectivity during Cue Exposure and the Ability to Resist Smoking in the Initial Hours of a Quit Attempt," Quitting smoking is the single best change in behavior that smokers can make to improve their health and extend their lives. Although most smokers express a strong desire to stop using cigarettes, the vast majority of quit attempts end in relapse. Relapse is particularly likely when smokers encounter cigarette cues. A striking number of relapses occur very quickly, with many occurring within as little as 24 hrs. Characterizing what distinguishes successful quit attempts from unsuccessful ones, particularly just after cessation is initiated, is a research priority. We addressed this significant issue by examining the association between functional connectivity during cigarette cue exposure and smoking behavior during the first 24 hrs of a quit attempt. Functional MRI was used to measure brain activity during cue exposure in nicotine-deprived daily smokers during the first day of a quit attempt. Participants were then given the opportunity to smoke. Using data collected in two parent studies, we identified a subset of participants who chose to smoke and a matched subset who declined ( n = 38). Smokers who were able to resist smoking displayed significant functional connectivity between the left anterior insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas there was no such connectivity for those who chose to smoke. Notably, there were no differences in mean levels of activation in brain regions of interest, underscoring the importance of assessing interregional connectivity when investigating the links between cue-related neural responses and overt behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first study to link patterns of functional connectivity and actual cigarette use during the pivotal first hours of attempt to change smoking behavior.

0.211615979,20529903,Estimating genome-wide IBD sharing from SNP data via an efficient hidden Markov model of LD with application to gene mapping,"Motivation: Association analysis is the method of choice for studying complex multifactorial diseases. The premise of this method is that affected persons contain some common genomic regions with similar SNP alleles and such areas will be found in this analysis. An important disadvantage of GWA studies is that it does not distinguish between genomic areas that are inherited from a common ancestor [identical by descent (IBD)] and areas that are identical merely by state [identical by state (IBS)]. Clearly, areas that can be marked with higher probability as IBD and have the same correlation with the disease status of identical areas that are more probably only IBS, are better candidates to be causative, and yet this distinction is not encoded in standard association analysis. Results: We develop a factorial hidden Markov model-based algorithm for computing genome-wide IBD sharing. The algorithm accepts as input SNP data of measured individuals and estimates the probability of IBD at each locus for every pair of individuals. For two g-degree relatives, when g ‚â•8, the computation yields a precision of IBD tagging of over 50% higher than previous methods for 95% recall. Our algorithm uses a first-order Markovian model for the linkage disequilibrium process and employs a reduction of the state space of the inheritance vector from being exponential in g to quadratic. The higher accuracy along with the reduced time complexity marks our method as a feasible means for IBD mapping in practical scenarios.

Peer reviewed publications reporting the prevalence of Salmonella in cattle were searched through five electronic databases (PubMed, Google scholar, Agricola, Scopus, CAB direct) and through manual search. We obtained 71 publications with 75 datasets consisting a total of 52,766 animals examined and 5,010 Salmonella positive cattle from 29 countries in six continents (except from Antarctica). Pooled prevalence of Salmonella in cattle was 9% (95% confidence interval: 7‚Äì11%). Significantly high heterogeneity ( I 2 = 98.7%, P < 0.01) was observed among all studies as well as within continents. Prevalence varied from 2% (Europe) to 16% (North America).

Overweight dogs exhibit postprandial hyperlipidaemia, highlighting the need to identify potential dysregulations in lipid metabolism. This study investigated metabolites related to lipid metabolism (i.e. acylcarnitines and taurine) and phospholipids in a feed-challenge test and aimed to identify metabolic variations in spontaneously overweight dogs. Twenty-eight healthy male Labrador Retriever dogs were included, 12 of which were classified as lean (body condition score (BCS) 4‚Äì5 on a 9-point scale) and 16 as overweight (BCS 6‚Äì8). After overnight fasting (14‚Äì17‚Äâh), fasting blood samples were collected and dogs were fed a high-fat meal followed by postprandial blood sample collection hourly for 4‚Äâh. Liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) was used to identify plasma metabolites and phospholipids. Multivariate models, mixed model repeated measures and linear regression analyses were used for data interpretation. Results In all dogs, propionylcarnitine, stearoylcarnitine and nine phospholipids increased in response to food intake, while vaccenylcarnitine decreased ( P ‚â§‚Äâ0.005 for all). Overall, carnitine and acetylcarnitine signal areas in the feed-challenge test were lower in overweight dogs ( P ‚â§‚Äâ0.004). Notably, fasting plasma acetylcarnitine was lower in overweight dogs than in lean dogs ( P =‚Äâ0.001) and it did not change in response to feeding. The latter finding was in contrast to the decreased acetylcarnitine signal area found in lean dogs at one hour postprandially ( P <‚Äâ0.0001). One fasting phosphatidylcholine (PCaa C38:4) was higher in prominently overweight dogs (BCS‚Äâ>‚Äâ6) than in lean dogs ( P <‚Äâ0.05). Conclusions Plasma carnitine status was overall lower in spontaneously overweight dogs than in lean dogs in this cohort of healthy Labrador Retriever dogs, indicating a potential carnitine insufficiency in the overweight group. The acetylcarnitine response in overweight dogs indicated decreased fatty acid oxidation at fasting and metabolic inflexibility to food intake. Further studies on metabolic inflexibility and its potential role in the metabolism of overweight dogs are warranted.

When observers saccade to a stationary object they overestimate its duration, as if the brain were filling in the saccadic gap with the post-saccadic image. We first demonstrate that this illusion holds for moving objects, implying that the perception of time, velocity, and distance traveled become discrepant. We then show that this discrepancy is partially resolved up to 500 ms after a saccade: the perceived offset position of a post-saccadic moving stimulus shows a greater forward mislocalization when pursued after a saccade than during pursuit alone. These data are consistent with the idea that the temporal bias is resolved by the subsequent spatial adjustment to provide a percept that is coherent in its gist but inconsistent in its detail.

Here we asked whether the cerebellum represents temporal aspects of oscillatory neuronal activity, measured as instantaneous phase and difference between instantaneous phases of oscillations in two cerebral cortical areas involved in cognitive function. We simultaneously recorded Purkinje cell (PC) single-unit spike activity in cerebellar lobulus simplex (LS) and Crus I and local field potential (LFP) activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampus CA1 region (dCA1). Purkinje cells in cerebellar LS and Crus I differentially represented specific phases and phase differences of mPFC and dCA1 LFP oscillations in a frequency-specific manner, suggesting a site- and frequency-specific cerebellar representation of temporal aspects of neuronal oscillations in non-motor cerebral cortical areas. These findings suggest that cerebellar interactions with cerebral cortical areas involved in cognitive functions might involve temporal coordination of neuronal oscillations.

Synchronization can be an important indicator for the quantification of uterine contractions. Methods The spatialtermporal myometrial activity recordings were performed using a 151-channel noninvasive magnetic sensor system called SARA. This device covers the entire pregnant abdomen and records the magnetic field corresponding to the electrical activity generated in the uterine myometrium. The data was collected at 250 samples/sec and was resampled with 25 samples/sec and then filtered in the band of 0.1‚Äì0.2 Hz to study the primary magnetic activity of the uterus related to contractions. The synchronization between a channel pair was computed. It was inferred from a statistical tendency to maintain a nearly constant phase difference over a given period of time even though the analytic phase of each channel may change markedly during that time frame. The analytic phase was computed after taking Hilbert transform of the magnetic field data. The process was applied on the pairs of magnetic field traces (240 sec length) with a stepping window of 20 sec duration which is long enough to cover two cycle of the lowest frequency of interest (0.1 Hz). The analysis was repeated by stepping the window at 10 sec intervals. The spatial patterns of the synchronization indices covering the anterior transabdominal area were computed. For this, regional coil-pairs were used. For a given coil, the coil pairs were constructed with the surrounding six coils. The synchronization indices were computed for each coil pair, averaged over the 21 coil-pairs and then assigned as the synchronization index to that particular coil. This procedure was tested on six pregnant subjects at the gestational age between 29 and 40 weeks admitted to the hospital for contractions. The RMS magnetic field for each coil was also computed. Results The results show that the spatial patterns of the synchronization indices change and follow the periodic pattern of the uterine contraction cycle. Spatial patterns of synchronization indices and the RMS magnetic fields show similarities in few window frames and also show large differences in few other windows. For six subjects, the average synchronization indices were: 0.346 ¬± 0.068 for the quiescent baseline period and 0.545 ¬± 0.022 at the peak of the contraction. Discussion These results show that synchronization indices and their spatial distributions depict uterine contractions and relaxations.",Biomedical engineering online,ENG
0.684302457,15580273,Locus ‚Äòdecontraction‚Äô and centromeric recruitment contribute to allelic exclusion of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene," Allelic exclusion of immunoglobulin genes ensures the expression of a single antibody molecule in B cells through mostly unknown mechanisms. Large-scale contraction of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( Igh ) locus facilitates rearrangements between Igh variable (V H ) and diversity gene segments in pro‚ÄìB cells. Here we show that these long-range interactions are mediated by ‚Äòlooping‚Äô of individual Igh subdomains. The Igk locus also underwent contraction by looping in small pre‚ÄìB and immature B cells, demonstrating that immunoglobulin loci are in a contracted state in rearranging cells. Successful Igh recombination induced the rapid reversal of locus contraction in response to pre‚ÄìB cell receptor signaling, which physically separated the distal V H genes from the proximal Igh domain, thus preventing further rearrangements. In the absence of locus contraction, only the four most proximal V H genes escaped allelic exclusion in immature Œº-transgenic B lymphocytes. Pre‚ÄìB cell receptor signaling also led to rapid repositioning of one Igh allele to repressive centromeric domains in response to downregulation of interleukin 7 signaling. These data link both locus ‚Äòdecontraction‚Äô and centromeric recruitment to the establishment of allelic exclusion at the Igh locus. ",Nature immunology,IMMUN

We explored the possibility that parent speech provides information about letters, and also that children‚Äôs speech reflects their own letter knowledge. By studying conversations transcribed in CHILDES ( MacWhinney, 2000 ) between parents and children aged one to five, we found that alphabetic order influenced use of individual letters and letter sequences. The frequency of letters in children‚Äôs books influenced parent utterances throughout the age range studied, but children‚Äôs utterances only after age two. Conversations emphasized some literacy-relevant features of letters, such as their shapes and association with words, but not letters‚Äô sounds. Describing these patterns and how they change over the preschool years offers important insight into the home literacy environment. ",Reading and writing,PSYCH

Methods:  Human milk and infant gastric samples were collected from 14 preterm (23‚Äì32 wk birth gestational age) mother-infant pairs within 7‚Äì98 days postnatal age. Gastric samples were collected 1, 2 and 3 h after beginning of feeding. Samples were analyzed for pH, proteolysis, general protease activity and the concentrations of pepsin, gastrin and gastrin-releasing peptide. One-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Tukey‚Äôs multiple comparisons test was used.    Results:  Gastric pH was significantly decreased after each hour in the preterm infant stomach from 1 to 3 h postprandial. Proteolysis increased significantly from human milk to gastric contents at 1, 2 and 3 h postprandial (by 62, 131% and 181%, p < 0.05). General protease activity increased significantly by 58% from human milk to the gastric contents at 2 h postprandial. Gastrin-releasing peptide was present in human milk whereas gastrin was produced in the infant stomach.    Conclusion:  Though preterm infants may digest human milk proteins to a lesser extent than term infants, we demonstrated that the preterm infant stomach actively degrades milk proteins with increasing breakdown over digestion time.

0.65070695,16617838,Strength of British English Accents in Altered Listening Conditions," This work is concerned with the processing or representational level at which accent forms learned early in life can change, and whether alteration to the speaker's auditory environment can elicit an original accent. In experiment one, recordings were made of an equal number of a) speakers living in the Home Counties of Britain (around the London conurbation), but who claimed to have retained the accent of the region they originally came from, b) speakers who stated they had lost their regional accent and acquired a Home Counties accent and c) native Home Counties speakers. They read two texts in a normal listening environment. Listeners rated the similarity in accent between each of these texts and all other texts. The results showed that in the normal listening conditions, speakers who had lost their accent were rated more similar to Home Counties English speakers than to those speakers from the same region who had retained their accent. In experiment two, recordings of the same speakers under frequency shifted and delayed auditory feedback, as well as the normal listening conditions used earlier, were rated in order to see whether the manipulations of listening environment elicited the speaker's original accent. Listeners rated similarity of accent in a sample of speech recorded under normal listening against a sample read by another speaker in one of the altered listening conditions. When listening condition was altered, speakers who had lost their original accent were rated as more similar to those who had retained their accent. It is concluded that accent differences can be elicited by altering listening environment because the speech systems of these speakers are more vulnerable than speakers who do not change their original accent.

The reactions of these two radicals with 3d transition metal ions, in the form of M(hfac) 2 (where M = Co or Mn, hfac: hexafluoroacetylacetone), result in four metal‚Äìorganic complexes Co(hfac) 2 (NNPhOMe) 2 , 1 ; Co(hfac) 2 (NNT) 2 ¬∑(H 2 O), 2 ; Mn(hfac) 2 (NNPhOMe)¬∑ x (C 7 H 16 ), 3 ; and Mn(hfac) 2 (NNT) 2 , 4 . The crystal structure and magnetic properties of these complexes are investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, dc magnetization, infrared, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. The compounds 1 and 4 crystallize in the triclinic, P 1ÃÖ, space group, whereas complex 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic structure with the C 2/ c space group and forms chain-like structure along the c direction. The complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic symmetry with the P 2 1 / c space group in which the N‚ÄìO unit of the radical coordinates with the Co ion through hydrogen bonding of a water molecule. All compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic interactions between the transition metal ions and nitronyl nitroxide radicals. The magnetic exchange interactions ( J / K B ) are derived using isotropic spin Hamiltonian H = ‚àí2 J ‚àë( S metal S radical ) for the model fitting to the magnetic susceptibility data for 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 . The exchange interaction strengths are found to be ‚àí328, ‚àí1.25, ‚àí248, and ‚àí256 K, for the 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 metal‚Äìorganic complexes, respectively. Quantum chemical density functional theory (DFT) computations are carried out on several models of the metal‚Äìradical complexes to elucidate the magnetic interactions at the molecular level.

0.562854397,25446897,"Dissecting the Tumor Myeloid Compartment Reveals Rare Activating Antigen Presenting Cells, Critical for T cell Immunity"," SUMMARY  It is well understood that antigen-presenting cells (APC) within tumors typically do not maintain cytotoxic T cell (CTL) function, despite engaging them. Across multiple mouse tumor models and human tumor biopsies, we have delineated the intratumoral dendritic-cell (DC) populations as distinct from macrophage populations. Within these, CD103 + DCs are extremely sparse and yet remarkably capable CTL stimulators. These are uniquely dependent upon IRF8, Zbtb46 and Batf3 transcription factors and generated by GM-CSF and Flt3L cytokines. Regressing tumors have higher proportions of these cells, T-cell dependent immune clearance relies upon them, and abundance of their transcripts in human tumors correlates with clinical outcome. This cell type presents opportunities for prognostic and therapeutic approaches across multiple cancer types. ",Cancer cell,ONCO
0.246949209,20377912,The HP0256 gene product is involved in motility and cell envelope architecture of  Helicobacter pylori,"Background Helicobacter pylori is the causative agent for gastritis, and peptic and duodenal ulcers. The bacterium displays 5-6 polar sheathed flagella that are essential for colonisation and persistence in the gastric mucosa. The biochemistry and genetics of flagellar biogenesis in H. pylori has not been fully elucidated. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the gene HP0256, annotated as hypothetical, was a FliJ homologue. In Salmonella , FliJ is a chaperone escort protein for FlgN and FliT, two proteins that themselves display chaperone activity for components of the hook, the rod and the filament. Results Ablation of the HP0256 gene in H. pylori significantly reduced motility. However, flagellin and hook protein synthesis was not affected in the HP0256 mutant. Transmission electron transmission microscopy revealed that the HP0256 mutant cells displayed a normal flagellum configuration, suggesting that HP0256 was not essential for assembly and polar localisation of the flagella in the cell. Interestingly, whole genome microarrays of an HP0256 mutant revealed transcriptional changes in a number of genes associated with the flagellar regulon and the cell envelope, such as outer membrane proteins and adhesins. Consistent with the array data, lack of the HP0256 gene significantly reduced adhesion and the inflammatory response in host cells. Conclusions We conclude that HP0256 is not a functional counterpart of FliJ in H. pylori . However, it is required for full motility and it is involved, possibly indirectly, in expression of outer membrane proteins and adhesins involved in pathogenesis and adhesion.",BMC microbiology,ANIMAL
0.295714013,22864647,A Predictive Model for Neurodevelopmental Outcome Following the Norwood Procedure," Neurodevelopmental outcomes following the Norwood procedure for single right ventricular lesions are worse than those in the normal population. It would be valuable to identify which patients at the time of Norwood discharge are at greatest risk of neurodevelopmental impairment later in childhood. As such, we sought to construct and validate a model to predict poor neurodevelopmental outcome using variables readily available to the clinician. Using data from 14-month neurodevelopmental outcome of the Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) trial, a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis model was developed to predict severe neurodevelopmental impairment, defined as a Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) of <70 on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development¬Æ-II. The model was then validated using data from subjects enrolled in the Infant Single Ventricle (ISV) trial.  PDI scores were <70 in 138 of 313 subjects (44%). Predictors of PDI<70 were: post-Norwood length of ICU stay >46 days, genetic syndrome or other anomalies, birth weight <2.7 kg, additional cardiac surgical procedures, and use of ‚â•5 medications at hospital discharge. Using these risk factors, the CART model correctly identified 75% of SVR subjects with PDI<70. When the CART model was applied to 70 subjects from the ISV trial, the correct classification rate was 67%.  This model of variables from the Norwood hospitalization can help identify infants at risk for neurodevelopmental impairment. However, given the overall high prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairment and the fact that nearly one-third of severely affected children would not have been identified by these risk factors, close surveillance and assessment for early intervention services is warranted for all infants following the Norwood procedure.

0.201520868,28965701,"Environmental exposure to manganese in air: Tremor, motor and cognitive symptom profiles","  Background:  Excessive exposure to manganese (Mn) may cause parkinsonian-like motor and tremor symptoms and adverse cognitive effects, including problems with executive functioning (EF), resembling those found in later-stage Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD). Studies seeking to differentiate PD patients into subgroups with associated cognitive and functional outcomes using motor and tremor symptoms identified tremor-dominant (TD) and non-tremor dominant (NTD) subtypes. It is unclear whether differing patterns of pathophysiology and symptoms exist in Mn neurotoxicity, as they do in PD.    Methods:  Residents of East Liverpool (n=83) and Marietta, OH (n=99) exposed to chronic (>10 years) environmental Mn through industrial pollution were administered neuropsychological measures and a physician-rated scale of movement-disorder symptoms. Two-step cluster analysis was used to group residents based on tremor symptoms, bradykinesia/rigidity symptoms, gait disturbance, and executive function. Cluster membership was validated using modeled air-Mn exposure and a computerized tremor measure.    Results:  Elevated tremor and motor symptoms and executive dysfunction were observed, and TD and NTD symptom clusters were identified. Two additional clusters were also identified: Executive Dysfunction and Normal Functioning. The NTD residents, with elevated levels of gait disturbance and other movement disorder symptoms, did not evidence EF impairment, as predicted. Instead, residents with EF impairment formed their own cluster, and were relatively free of movement disorder symptoms.    Conclusions:  Results resemble reports in the PD literature with TD and NTD clusters identified, but executive dysfunction did not cluster with NTD symptoms. PD and Mn exposure likely have differing pathophysiology and developmental courses, and therefore different symptom patterns, even when similar symptoms are present.  ",Neurotoxicology,ENVIRON
0.968816301,29321893,Opposing deer and caterpillar foraging preferences may prevent reductions in songbird prey biomass in historically overbrowsed forests,"Abstract Overbrowsing by ungulates decimates plant populations and reduces diversity in a variety of ecosystems, but the mechanisms by which changes to plant community composition influence other trophic levels are poorly understood. In addition to removal of avian nesting habitat, browsing is hypothesized to reduce bird density and diversity through reduction of insect prey on browse‚Äêtolerant hosts left behind by deer. In this study, we excluded birds from branches of six tree species to quantify differences in songbird prey removal across trees that vary in deer browse preference. Early in the breeding season, birds preyed on caterpillars at levels proportional to their abundance on each host. Combining these data with tree species composition data from stands exposed to experimentally controlled deer densities over 30¬†years ago, we tested whether overbrowsing by white‚Äêtailed deer reduces prey biomass long after deer densities are reduced. Our analysis predicts total prey availability in the canopy of regenerating forests is fairly robust to historic exposure to high deer densities, though distribution of prey available from host species changes dramatically. This predicted compensatory effect was unexpected and is driven by high prey abundance on a single host tree species avoided by browsing deer, Prunus serotina . Thus, while we confirm that prey abundance on host trees can act as a reliable predictor for relative prey availability, this study shows that quantifying prey abundance across host trees is essential to understanding how changes in tree species composition interact with ungulate browse preference to determine prey availability for songbirds.",Ecology and evolution,ECO
0.292109189,27446495,"Comparison between Three Promising √ü-emitting Radionuclides,  67 Cu,  47 Sc and  161 Tb, with Emphasis on Doses Delivered to Minimal Residual Disease","PURPOSE : Radionuclide therapy is increasingly seen as a promising option to target minimal residual disease. Copper-67, scandium-47 and terbium-161 have a medium-energy Œ≤ - emission which is similar to that of lutetium-177, but offer the advantage of having diagnostic partner isotopes suitable for pretreatment imaging. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of 67 Cu, 47 Sc and 161 Tb to irradiate small tumors. METHODS: The absorbed dose deriving from a homogeneous distribution of 67 Cu, 47 Sc or 161 Tb in water-density spheres was calculated with the Monte Carlo code CELLDOSE. The diameters of the spheres ranged from 5 mm to 10 ¬µm, thus simulating micrometastases or single tumor cells. All electron emissions, including Œ≤ - spectra, Auger and conversion electrons were taken into account. Because these radionuclides differ in electron energy per decay, the simulations were run assuming that 1 MeV was released per ¬µm 3 , which would result in a dose of 160 Gy if totally absorbed. RESULTS: The absorbed dose was similar for the three radionuclides in the 5-mm sphere (146-149 Gy), but decreased differently in smaller spheres. In particular, 161 Tb delivered higher doses compared to the other radionuclides. For instance, in the 100-¬µm sphere, the absorbed dose was 24.1 Gy with 67 Cu, 14.8 Gy with 47 Sc and 44.5 Gy with 161 Tb. Auger and conversion electrons accounted for 71% of 161 Tb dose. The largest dose differences were found in cell-sized spheres. In the 10-¬µm sphere, the dose delivered by 161 Tb was 4.1 times higher than that from 67 Cu and 8.1 times that from 47 Sc. CONCLUSION: 161 Tb can effectively irradiate small tumors thanks to its decay spectrum that combines medium-energy Œ≤ - emission and low-energy conversion and Auger electrons. Therefore 161 Tb might be a better candidate than 67 Cu and 47 Sc for treating minimal residual disease in a clinical setting.",Theranostics,IMMUN
0.154895727,29487541,Adrenergic Blockade Bi-directionally and Asymmetrically Alters Functional Brain-Heart Communication and Prolongs Electrical Activities of the Brain and Heart during Asphyxic Cardiac Arrest,"Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in the United States. The neurophysiological mechanism underlying sudden death is not well understood. Previously we have shown that the brain is highly stimulated in dying animals and that asphyxia-induced death could be delayed by blocking the intact brain-heart neuronal connection. These studies suggest that the autonomic nervous system plays an important role in mediating sudden cardiac arrest. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of phentolamine and atenolol, individually or combined, in prolonging functionality of the vital organs in CO 2 -mediated asphyxic cardiac arrest model. Rats received either saline, phentolamine, atenolol, or phentolamine plus atenolol, 30 min before the onset of asphyxia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were simultaneously collected from each rat during the entire process and investigated for cardiac and brain functions using a battery of analytic tools. We found that adrenergic blockade significantly suppressed the initial decline of cardiac output, prolonged electrical activities of both brain and heart, asymmetrically altered functional connectivity within the brain, and altered, bi-directionally and asymmetrically, functional, and effective connectivity between the brain and heart. The protective effects of adrenergic blockers paralleled the suppression of brain and heart connectivity, especially in the right hemisphere associated with central regulation of sympathetic function. Collectively, our results demonstrate that blockade of brain-heart connection via alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers significantly prolonged the detectable activities of both the heart and the brain in asphyxic rat. The beneficial effects of combined alpha and beta blockers may help extend the survival of cardiac arrest patients.",Frontiers in physiology,PHYSIO

Background: Machine learning and image analysis are becoming increasingly important in pathology applications for automatic analysis of histological tissue samples. Pathologists rely on multiple, contrasting stains to analyze tissue samples, but histological stains are developed for visual analysis and are not always ideal for automatic analysis. Materials and Methods: Thirteen different histological stains were used to stain adjacent prostate tissue sections from radical prostatectomies. We evaluate the stains for both supervised and unsupervised classification of stain/tissue combinations. For supervised classification we measure the error rate of nonlinear support vector machines, and for unsupervised classification we use the Rand index and the F-measure to assess the clustering results of a Gaussian mixture model based on expectation‚Äìmaximization. Finally, we investigate class separability measures based on scatter criteria. Results: A methodology for quantitative evaluation of histological stains in terms of their classification and clustering efficacy that aims at improving segmentation and color decomposition. We demonstrate that for a specific tissue type, certain stains perform consistently better than others according to objective error criteria.

0.26686624,17268469,bicoid  RNA localization requires specific binding of an endosomal sorting complex," Summary paragraph:  bicoid mRNA localises to the anterior of the Drosophila egg, where it is translated to form a morphogen gradient of Bicoid protein that patterns the head and thorax of the embryo. Although bicoid was the first identified localised cytoplasmic determinant 1 - 4 , little is known about how the mRNA is coupled to the microtubule-dependent transport pathway that targets it to the anterior, and it has been proposed that it is recognised by a complex of many redundant proteins, each of which binds to the localisation element in its 3'UTR with little or no specificity 5 . Indeed, the only known RNA-binding protein that co-localises with bicoid mRNA is Staufen, which binds non-specifically to dsRNA in vitro 6 , 7 . Here we show that mutants in all subunits of the ESCRT-II complex (Vps22, Vps25 and Vps36) abolish the final Staufen-dependent step in bcd RNA localisation. ESCRT-II is a highly conserved component of the pathway that sorts ubiquitinated endosomal proteins into internal vesicles 8 , 9 , and functions as a tumour-suppressor by removing activated receptors from the cytoplasm 10 , 11 . However, the role of ESCRT-II in bicoid localisation appears to be independent of endosomal sorting, because mutations in ESCRT-I and III components have no effect of the targeting of bicoid mRNA. Instead, Vps36 functions by binding directly and specifically to stem-loop V of the bicoid 3'UTR through its N-terminal GLUE domain 12 , making it the first example of a sequence specific RNA-binding protein that recognises the bicoid localisation signal. Furthermore, Vps36 localises to the anterior of the oocyte in a bicoid mRNA-dependent manner, and is required for the subsequent recruitment of Staufen to the bicoid complex. This novel function of ESCRT-II as an RNA-binding complex is conserved in vertebrates, and may explain some of its roles that are independent of endosomal sorting. ",Nature,BIOCHEM

Methods The study population included 24‚Äâ510 respondents aged 25‚Äì74 years who responded to a survey questionnaire in Mid-Sweden in 2012 (response rate 53%). Psychological distress was measured with the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire, and multivariate logistic regression models were used in statistical analyses, adjusting for age, employment status and social support. Results The prevalence of psychological distress was higher in women (16.4%) than in men (11.3%; p<0.001).

0.140197621,10919863,Cyclic Nucleotide‚ÄìGated Channels Colocalize with Adenylyl Cyclase in Regions of Restricted Camp Diffusion,"Cyclic AMP is a ubiquitous second messenger that coordinates diverse cellular functions. Current methods for measuring cAMP lack both temporal and spatial resolution, leading to the pervasive notion that, unlike Ca 2+ , cAMP signals are simple and contain little information. Here we show the development of adenovirus-expressed cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated channels as sensors for cAMP. Homomultimeric channels composed of the olfactory Œ± subunit responded rapidly to jumps in cAMP concentration, and their cAMP sensitivity was measured to calibrate the sensor for intracellular measurements. We used these channels to detect cAMP, produced by either heterologously expressed or endogenous adenylyl cyclase, in both single cells and cell populations. After forskolin stimulation, the endogenous adenylyl cyclase in C6-2B glioma cells produced high concentrations of cAMP near the channels, yet the global cAMP concentration remained low. We found that rapid exchange of the bulk cytoplasm in whole-cell patch clamp experiments did not prevent the buildup of significant levels of cAMP near the channels in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells expressing an exogenous adenylyl cyclase. These results can be explained quantitatively by a cell compartment model in which cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated channels colocalize with adenylyl cyclase in microdomains, and diffusion of cAMP between these domains and the bulk cytosol is significantly hindered. In agreement with the model, we measured a slow rate of cAMP diffusion from the whole-cell patch pipette to the channels (90% exchange in 194 s, compared with 22‚Äì56 s for substances that monitor exchange with the cytosol). Without a microdomain and restricted diffusional access to the cytosol, we are unable to account for all of the results. It is worth noting that in models of unrestricted diffusion, even in extreme proximity to adenylyl cyclase, cAMP does not reach high enough concentrations to substantially activate PKA or cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated channels, unless the entire cell fills with cAMP. Thus, the microdomains should facilitate rapid and efficient activation of both PKA and cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated channels, and allow for local feedback control of adenylyl cyclase. Localized cAMP signals should also facilitate the differential regulation of cellular targets.",The Journal of general physiology,PHYSIO

MultiMap is a new tool that allows the visualization, 3D segmentation and quantification of fluorescent structures selectively in the neuropil from large stacks of confocal microscopy images. The major contribution of this tool is the posibility to easily navigate and create regions of interest of any shape and size within a large brain area that will be automatically 3D segmented and quantified to determine the density of puncta in the neuropil. As a proof of concept, we focused on the analysis of glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic axon terminals in the mouse hippocampal region to demonstrate its use as a tool to provide putative excitatory and inhibitory synaptic maps. The segmentation and quantification method has been validated over expert labeled images of the mouse hippocampus and over two benchmark datasets, obtaining comparable results to the expert detections.",Frontiers in neuroanatomy,NEURO

Methods: We evaluated gene expression in 63 paired RNA specimens from frozen normal and tumour thyroid tissues with individual iodine-131 (I-131) doses (0.008‚Äì8.6‚ÄâGy, no unirradiated controls) received from Chernobyl fallout during childhood (Ukrainian-American cohort). Approximately half of these randomly selected samples (32 tumour/normal tissue RNA specimens) were hybridised on 64 whole-genome microarrays (Agilent, 4 √ó 44‚ÄâK). Associations between I-131 dose and gene expression were assessed separately in normal and tumour tissues using Kruskal‚àíWallis and linear trend tests. Of 155 genes significantly associated with I-131 after Bonferroni correction and with ‚©æ2-fold increase per dose category, we selected 95 genes. On the remaining 31 RNA samples these genes were used for validation purposes using qRT‚àíPCR. Results: Expression of eight genes ( ABCC3, C1orf9, C6orf62, FGFR1OP2, HEY2, NDOR1, STAT3, and UCP3 ) in normal tissue and six genes ( ANKRD46, CD47, HNRNPH1, NDOR1, SCEL, and SERPINA1 ) in tumour tissue was significantly associated with I-131. PANTHER/DAVID pathway analyses demonstrated significant over-representation of genes coding for nucleic acid binding in normal and tumour tissues, and for p53, EGF, and FGF signalling pathways in tumour tissue.

0.996554644,22919460,Human responses to unfairness with primary rewards and their biological limits,"Humans bargaining over money tend to reject unfair offers, whilst chimpanzees bargaining over primary rewards of food do not show this same motivation to reject. Whether such reciprocal fairness represents a predominantly human motivation has generated considerable recent interest. We induced either moderate or severe thirst in humans using intravenous saline, and examined responses to unfairness in an Ultimatum Game with water. We ask if humans also reject unfair offers for primary rewards. Despite the induction of even severe thirst, our subjects rejected unfair offers. Further, our data provide tentative evidence that this fairness motivation was traded-off against the value of the primary reward to the individual, a trade-off determined by the subjective value of water rather than by an objective physiological metric of value. Our data demonstrate humans care about fairness during bargaining with primary rewards, but that subjective self-interest may limit this fairness motivation.",Scientific reports,PSYCH

This study presents our experiences with male suburethral slings over the past decade. Methods In this study, we considered patients who presented with SUI and were diagnosed with an intrinsic sphincteric deficiency due to postprostatectomy incontinence (PPI) or other causes (non-PPI). Patients who underwent the suburethral sling procedure using a polypropylene mesh and a cardiovascular patch were retrospectively included. An urodynamic study was performed before and after the operation. Global response assessment (GRA) and SUI grading were used for surgical outcome. The revision rate and the infection rate were also evaluated. Results A total 31 patients were enrolled in this study; the mean patient age was 59.5¬±18.9 years, and the mean follow-up period was 36.9¬±29.4 months. Fourteen patients comprised the non-PPI group and 17 were in the PPI group. The preoperative SUI of all patients were categorized as a moderate to severe problem according to the SUI grade, with a mean score of 2.32¬±0.48 before the operation and 0.48¬±0.57 after the operation. With a mean score of 2.35¬±0.71, GRA showed that the patients were satisfied with the treatment. After the sling procedure, 4 patients (13%) reported a mild improvement, 12 (38.7%) a moderate improvement, while 15 (48.4%) reported an excellent improvement. Six patients (19.4%), including 5 from the non-PPI group (35.7%) and 1 (5.9%) from the PPI group (P=0.037), underwent sling removal because of infection. Conclusions The male suburethral sling procedure using a polypropylene mesh and a cardiovascular patch is a safe, efficacious, and inexpensive surgical procedure for PPI. In cases of neurological incontinence, however, the higher infection rate in non-PPI patients means that they should be carefully managed.",International neurourology journal,CLINIC
0.066771626,28224468,Daytime Locations in Spatial Mismatch: Job Accessibility and Employment at Reentry From Prison," Individuals recently released from prison confront many barriers to employment. One potential obstacle is spatial mismatch ‚Äîthe concentration of low-skilled, nonwhite job-seekers within central cities and the prevalence of relevant job opportunities in outlying areas. Prior research has found mixed results about the importance of residential place for reentry outcomes. In this article, we propose that residential location matters for finding work, but this largely static measure does not capture the range of geographic contexts that individuals inhabit throughout the day. We combine novel, real-time GPS information on daytime locations and self-reported employment collected from smartphones with sophisticated measures of job accessibility to test the relative importance of spatial mismatch based on residence and daytime locations. Our findings suggest that the ability of low-skilled, poor, and urban individuals to compensate for their residential deficits by traveling to job-rich areas is an overlooked and salient consideration in spatial mismatch perspectives.

0.448569341,30033617,A practical Bayesian adaptive design incorporating data from historical controls," In this paper, we develop the fixed-borrowing adaptive design, a Bayesian adaptive design which facilitates information borrowing from a historical trial using subject-level control data while assuring a reasonable upper bound on the maximum type I error rate and lower bound on the minimum power. First, one constructs an informative power prior from the historical data to be used for design and analysis of the new trial. At an interim analysis opportunity, one evaluates the degree of prior-data conflict. If there is too much conflict between the new trial data and the historical control data, the prior information is discarded and the study proceeds to the final analysis opportunity at which time a noninformative prior is used for analysis. Otherwise, the trial is stopped early and the informative power prior is used for analysis. Simulation studies are used to calibrate the early stopping rule. The proposed design methodology seam-lessly accommodates covariates in the statistical model, which the authors argue is necessary to justify borrowing information from historical controls. Implementation of the proposed methodology is straightforward for many common data models, including linear regression models, generalized linear regression models, and proportional hazards models. We demonstrate the methodology to design a cardiovascular outcomes trial for a hypothetical new therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and borrow information from the SAVOR trial, one of the earliest cardiovascular outcomes trials designed to assess cardiovascular risk in antidiabetic therapies.

0.895245764,29777828,Mutual Connectivity Analysis of Resting-State Functional MRI Data with Local Models," Functional connectivity analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) can represent brain networks and reveal insights into interactions amongst different brain regions. However, most connectivity analysis approaches adopted in practice are linear and non-directional. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantage of a data-driven, directed connectivity analysis approach called Mutual Connectivity Analysis using Local Models (MCA-LM) that approximates connectivity by modeling nonlinear dependencies of signal interaction, over more conventionally used approaches, such as Pearson‚Äôs and partial correlation, Patel‚Äôs conditional dependence measures, etcetera. We demonstrate on realistic simulations of fMRI data that, at long sampling intervals, i.e. high repetition time (TR) of fMRI signals, MCA-LM performs better than or comparable to correlation-based methods and Patel‚Äôs measures. However, at fast image acquisition rates corresponding to low TR, MCA-LM significantly outperforms these methods. This insight is particularly useful in the light of recent advances in fast fMRI acquisition techniques. Methods that can capture the complex dynamics of brain activity, such as MCA-LM, should be adopted to extract as much information as possible from the improved representation. Furthermore, MCA-LM works very well for simulations generated at weak neuronal interaction strengths, and simulations modeling inhibitory and excitatory connections as it disentangles the two opposing effects between pairs of regions/voxels. Additionally, we demonstrate that MCA-LM is capable of capturing meaningful directed connectivity on experimental fMRI data. Such results suggest that it introduces sufficient complexity into modeling fMRI time-series interactions that simple, linear approaches cannot, while being data-driven, computationally practical and easy to use. In conclusion, MCA-LM can provide valuable insights towards better understanding brain activity. ",NeuroImage,NEURO

This procedure requires the generation and equilibration of the mutant structures, followed by the calculation of partial free energy curves using an empirical valence bond potential in conjunction with biased molecular dynamics simulations and umbrella integration. The individual steps are automated and optimized for computational efficiency. This approach is used to rank a series of 15 dihydrofolate reductase mutants according to the hydride transfer reaction rate. The agreement between the calculated and experimental changes in the free energy barrier upon mutation is encouraging. The computational approach predicts the correct direction of the change in free energy barrier for all mutants, and the correlation coefficient between the calculated and experimental data is 0.82. This general approach for ranking protein designs has implications for protein engineering and drug design. ",The journal of physical chemistry. B,CHEM
0.508746609,30760930,Diabetes Relief in Mice by Glucose-Sensing Insulin-Secreting Human Œ±-Cells,"Cell identity switches, where terminally-differentiated cells convert into different cell-types when stressed, represent a widespread regenerative strategy in animals, yet they are poorly documented in mammals. In mice, some glucagon-producing pancreatic Œ±-cells and somatostatin-producing Œ¥-cells become insulin expressers upon ablation of insulin-secreting Œ≤-cells, promoting diabetes recovery. Whether human islets also display this plasticity, especially in diabetic conditions, remains unknown. Here we show that islet non-Œ≤-cells, namely Œ±-cells and PPY-producing Œ≥‚Äìcells, obtained from deceased non-diabetic or diabetic human donors, can be lineage-traced and reprogrammed by the transcription factors Pdx1 and MafA to produce and secrete insulin in response to glucose. When transplanted into diabetic mice, converted human Œ±-cells reverse diabetes and remain producing insulin even after 6 months. Surprisingly, insulin-producing Œ±-cells maintain Œ±-cell markers, as seen by deep transcriptomic and proteomic characterization. These observations provide conceptual evidence and a molecular framework for a mechanistic understanding of in situ cell plasticity as a treatment for diabetes and other degenerative diseases.",Nature,BIOCHEM
0.181154423,30608986,The economic burden of Lyme disease and the cost-effectiveness of Lyme disease interventions: A scoping review,"Introduction While Lyme disease (LD) is mostly treatable, misdiagnosed or untreated LD can result in debilitating sequelae and excessive healthcare usage. The objective of this review was to characterize the body of literature on the economic burden of Lyme disease (LD) and the cost-effectiveness of LD interventions, such as antibiotic treatment and vaccination. Methods We followed Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodologies. We systematically searched terms related to LD, economic evaluations, costs, and cost-effectiveness in Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, and the grey literature up to November 2017. We included primary economic evaluations conducted in North America and Europe, reporting LD-related costs or cost-effectiveness of human interventions. Two reviewers screened articles and charted data independently. Costs were standardized to 2017 United States dollars (USD). Results We screened 923 articles, and included 10 cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) and 11 cost analyses (CA). Three CEAs concluded LD vaccination was likely cost-effective only in endemic areas (probability of infection ‚â•1%). However, LD vaccination is not currently available as an intervention in the US or Europe. Six studies assessed economic burden from a societal perspective and estimated significant annual national economic impact of: 735,550 USD for Scotland (0.14 USD per capita, population = 5.40M), 142,562 USD in Sweden (0.014 USD per capita, 9.96M), 40.88M USD in Germany (0.51 USD per capita, 80.59M), 23.12M USD in the Netherlands (1.36 USD per capita, 17.08M), and up to 786M USD in the US (2.41 USD per capita, 326.63M). Conclusions Lyme disease imposes an economic burden that could be considered significant in the US and other developed countries to justify further research efforts in disease control and management. Societal costs for Lyme disease can be equally impactful as healthcare costs, but are not fully understood. Economic literature from countries with historically high incidence rates or increasing rates of Lyme disease are limited, and can be useful for future justification of resource allocation.",PloS one,EPIDEM

0.091075077,30851484,"Placental metal concentrations in relation to placental growth, efficiency and birth weight"," The quality of the intrauterine environment, in which the placenta plays a critical role, affects birth outcomes and lifelong health. The effect of metal contaminants on the growth and functioning of the placenta have not been widely reported but may provide insights into how metal exposures lead to these outcomes. We examined relationships between placental concentrations of cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) and measures of placental growth and functioning (placental weight, placental efficiency (the log ratio of placental weight and birth weight), chorionic disc area and disc eccentricity) as part of the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (N=1159). We additionally examined whether these associations were modified by placental concentrations of essential elements zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se). Associations were evaluated using generalized linear models. Multivariable-adjusted differences in placental weight were ‚àí7.81g (95% CI: ‚àí15.42, ‚àí2.48) with every ng/g increase in the Cd concentration of placenta (p-Value = 0.0009). Greater decrements placental weight and efficiency associated with placental Cd were observed for females. For placentae with below median Zn and Se concentrations, decrements in placental weight were ‚àí8.81g (95% CI: 16.85, ‚àí0.76) and ‚àí13.20g (95% CI: ‚àí20.70, ‚àí5.70) respectively. The Cd concentration of placenta was also associated with reductions in placental efficiency both overall, and in Zn- and Se-stratified models. No appreciable differences were observed with other elements (As, Hg or Pb) and with other placental measures (chorionic disc area and disc eccentricity). In structural equation models, placental weight was a mediator in the relation between placental Cd concentration and reduced birth weight. Our findings suggest a role of interacting essential and contaminant elements on birth weight that may be mediated by changes in the growth and function of the placenta.

In some cases, selection to recognize a diverse range of parasites has resulted in high levels of polymorphism, while elsewhere the protein sequence has changed rapidly under directional selection. We tested whether parasite recognition genes in the innate immune system show similar patterns of evolution. We sequenced seven peptidoglycan recognition protein genes ( PGRP s) from 12 lines of Drosophila melanogaster and one line of D. simulans and used a variety of tests to determine whether the observed mutations were selectively neutral. We were unable to detect either balancing or directional selection. This suggests that the molecular cues used by insects to detect parasites are highly conserved and probably under strong functional constraints which prevent their evolving to evade the host immune response. Therefore, interactions between these genes are unlikely to be the focus of host-parasite coevolution, at least in Drosophila . We also found evidence of gene conversion occurring between two genes, PGRP-SC1A and PGRP-SC1B . ",Journal of molecular evolution,ECO

Although plant responses to wounding and oral secretions have been studied, little is known about how signals from the rapidly transmitted vibrations caused by chewing insect feeding are integrated to produce effects on plant defenses. In this study, we examined whether 24 h of insect feeding vibrations caused changes in levels of phytohormones and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana when they were subjected to just feeding vibrations or feeding vibrations and wounding + methyl jasmonate (MeJA), compared to their respective controls of silent sham or wounding + MeJA. We showed that feeding vibrations alone caused a decrease in the concentrations of most phytohormones, compared to those found in control plants receiving no vibrations. When feeding vibrations were combined with wounding and application of MeJA, the results were more complex. For hormones whose levels were induced by wounding and MeJA (jasmonic acid, indole-3-butyric acid), the addition of feeding vibrations caused an even larger response. If the level of hormone was unchanged by wounding and MeJA compared with controls, then the addition of feeding vibrations had little effect. The levels of some VOCs were influenced by the treatments. Feeding vibrations alone caused an increase in Œ≤-ionone and decrease in methyl salicylate, and wounding + MeJA alone caused a decrease in benzaldehyde and methyl salicylate. When feeding vibrations were combined with wounding + MeJA, the effects on Œ≤-ionone and methyl salicylate were similar to those seen with feeding vibrations alone, and levels of benzaldehyde remained low as seen with wounding + MeJA alone. The widespread downregulation of plant hormones observed in this study is also seen in plant responses to cold, suggesting that membrane fluidity changes and/or downstream signaling may be common to both phenomena.",Frontiers in plant science,ANIMAL

We sought to identify the plausible stemness factor that determines the ‚Äúmolecular signature‚Äù of prostate cancer cells derived from different metastases (PC3, PCa2b, LNCaP, and DU145) and whether androgen receptor (AR) influences the maintenance of stemness features. Here we show SOX2 as a putative stem cell marker in PC3 prostate cancer cells and not in DU145, PCa2b, or LNCaP cells. PCa2b and PC3 cells were de PC3 cells demonstrate a marked incRease in SOX2 expression at protein and mRNA ived from bone metastases. PCa2b cells which are positive for the AR failed to demonstrate the expression of either CD44 or SOX2. Knockdown of AR in these cells did not affect the expression of either CD44 or SOX2. Conversely, PC3 cells which are negative for AR, expressed both CD44 and SOX2. However, the expression of AR down-regulated the expression of both CD44 and SOX2 in PC3 cells. CD44 regulates SOX2 expression as knockdown of CD44 reduces SOX2 levels considerably. SOX2 knockdown attenuated not only the expression of SNAIL and SLUG but also the migration and tumorsphere formation in PC3 cells. Collectively, our findings underscore a novel role of CD44 signaling in the maintenance of stemness and progression of cancer through SOX2 in AR-independent PC3 cells. SOX2 has a role in the regulation of expression of SNAIL and SLUG. SOX2 could be a potential therapeutic target to thwart the progression of SOX2 positive cancer cells or recurrence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.

This training, however, may not transfer to other known postural impairments, such as automatic postural responses to external perturbations.    Objectives  To evaluate the extent current treatments of motor retraining ameliorate impaired postural coordination when responding to a perturbation of standing balance.    Design  Planned secondary analysis of a prospectively registered (NCT01362049), randomized controlled trial with a blinded assessor.    Method  Sixty-eight subjects with chronic, recurrent, non-specific LBP were allocated to perform a postural response task as a secondary assessment one week before and one week after receiving either stabilization or Movement System Impairment (MSI)-directed treatment over 6 weekly 1-h sessions plus home exercises. For assessment, subjects completed the Oswestry disability and numeric pain rating questionnaires and then performed a postural response task of maintaining standing balance in response to 3 trials in each of 4 randomly presented directions of linear surface translations of the platform under the subjects' feet. Integrated amplitudes of surface electromyography (EMG) were recorded bilaterally from the rectus abdominis (RA), internal oblique (IO), and external oblique (EO) muscles during the postural response task.    Results  No significant effects of treatment on EMG responses were evident. Oswestry and numeric pain ratings decreased similarly following both treatments.    Conclusions  Stabilization and MSI-directed treatments do not affect trunk EMG responses to perturbations of standing balance in people with LBP, suggesting current methods of motor retraining do not sufficiently transfer to tasks of reactive postural control.

0.314367749,29358169,CCR5 governs DNA damage repair and breast cancer stem cell expansion," The functional significance of the chemokine receptor CCR5 in human breast cancer (BCa) epithelial cells is poorly understood. Here we report that CCR5 expression in human breast cancer correlates with poor outcome. CCR5 + BCa epithelial cells formed mammospheres and initiated tumors with >60-fold greater efficiency in mice. Reintroduction of CCR5 expression into CCR5-negative BCa cells promoted tumor metastases and induced DNA repair gene expression and activity. CCR5 antagonists Maraviroc and Vicriviroc dramatically enhanced cell killing mediated by DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Single cell analysis revealed CCR5 governs PI3K/Akt, ribosomal biogenesis, and cell survival signaling. As CCR5 augments DNA repair and is re-expressed selectively on cancerous but not normal breast epithelial cells, CCR5 inhibitors may enhance the tumor-specific activities of DDR-based treatments, allowing a dose reduction of standard chemotherapy and radiation.

0.889375118,16961965,Color constancy in natural scenes explained by global image statistics," To what extent do observers' judgments of surface color with natural scenes depend on global image statistics? To address this question, a psychophysical experiment was performed in which images of natural scenes under two successive daylights were presented on a computer-controlled high-resolution color monitor. Observers reported whether there was a change in reflectance of a test surface in the scene. The scenes were obtained with a hyperspectral imaging system and included variously trees, shrubs, grasses, ferns, flowers, rocks, and buildings. Discrimination performance, quantified on a scale of 0 to 1 with a color-constancy index, varied from 0.69 to 0.97 over 21 scenes and two illuminant changes, from a correlated color temperature of 25,000 K to 6700 K and from 4000 K to 6700 K. The best account of these effects was provided by receptor-based rather than colorimetric properties of the images. Thus, in a linear regression, 43% of the variance in constancy index was explained by the log of the mean relative deviation in spatial cone-excitation ratios evaluated globally across the two images of a scene. A further 20% was explained by including the mean chroma of the first image and its difference from that of the second image and a further 7% by the mean difference in hue. Together, all four global color properties accounted for 70% of the variance and provided a good fit to the effects of scene and of illuminant change on color constancy, and, additionally, of changing test-surface position. By contrast, a spatial-frequency analysis of the images showed that the gradient of the luminance amplitude spectrum accounted for only 5% of the variance. ",Visual neuroscience,NEURO

The high incidence of the condition, subsequent interference with participation in physical activity and substantial recovery time, highlights a need for effective interventions. Whilst many interventions have been described for the management of ERLP, currently there is a lack of high quality evidence for an effective intervention for the condition. Methods/Design A single-blinded randomised controlled clinical trial will be conducted in a community setting. Forty-five female volunteers aged between 18 and 40¬†years with a history of insidious onset of pain located between the knee and ankle of at least one month duration that is aggravated by weight bearing activities will be recruited for the study. Suitable participants will be randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups for the 6¬†week intervention period: (i) exercise only, (ii) rigid anti-pronation tape and exercise, (iii) elastic anti-pronation tape and exercise. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 1, 2 and 6 weeks using primary outcome measures of usual and worst pain visual analogue scale and global perceived improvement. Secondary outcome measures will include Foot and Ankle Ability Measure, Patient Specific Functional Scale and amount of activity in the previous week. In addition, participants will be contacted by phone to obtain primary and secondary outcome measures at 12, 18, 24 and 30¬†weeks.

0.345596935,27364608,Structural effects of modified ribonucleotides and magnesium in transfer RNAs," Modified nucleotides are ubiquitous and important to tRNA structure and function. To understand their effect on tRNA conformation, we performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations on yeast tRNA Phe and tRNA init , E. coli tRNA init and HIV tRNA Lys . Simulations were performed with the wild type modified nucleotides, using the recently developed CHARMM compatible force field parameter set for modified nucleotides [Xu, Y., Vanommeslaeghe, K., Aleksandrov, A., Mackerell AD, Nilsson, L., J. Comp. Chem., 2016], or with the corresponding unmodified nucleotides, and in the presence or absence of Mg 2+ . Results showed a stabilizing effect associated with the presence of the modifications and Mg 2+ for some important positions, such as modified guanosine in position 37 and dihydrouridines in 16/17 including both structural properties and base interactions. Some other modifications were also found to make subtle contributions to the structural properties of local domains. While we were not able to investigate the effect of Adenosine 37 in tRNA init and limitations were observed in the conformation of E. coli tRNA init , the presence of the modified nucleotides and of Mg 2+ better maintained the structural features and base interactions of the tRNA systems than in their absence indicating the utility of incorporating the modified nucleotides in simulations of tRNA and other RNAs.

0.293426683,16123088,Expression of Œ≤-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin genes during the normal and failed pregnancy,"  BACKGROUND  One of the first proteins synthesized by a conceptus, is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The receptor-binding Œ≤-subunit of hCG (hCGŒ≤) is encoded by highly homologous CGB, CGB5, CGB7 and CGB8 genes. The function of two additional gene copies, CGB1 and CGB2 , is still unknown.    AIM  We aimed to compare the expression of individual CGB genes during the normal pregnancy and in cases of recurrent miscarriages (RM) and ectopic pregnancy (EP)    METHODS  A semi-quantitative RT-PCR with fluorescent-labeled primers coupled with the gene-specific restriction and quantification was used.    RESULTS  The summarized expression of hCGŒ≤ genes was high throughout the pregnancy, and moderately correlated with hCG in serum. In cases of RM, reduced hormone values were consistent with low mRNA levels, whereas for EP no reduction in transcriptional activity was detected. CGB1 and CGB2 showed a considerable expressional peak during the first trimester, both in normal and ectopic pregnancy, but not for RM.    CONCLUSIONS  In case of RM, low hCG could result from expressional failure of hCGŒ≤ genes, whereas in EP the problems other than the transcriptional failure contribute to reduced hormone levels. The expression patterns of CGB1 and CGB2 suggest their putative role in the implantation stage.  ","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",BIOCHEM
0.401701182,26484435,Reduced prefrontal activation during working and long-term memory tasks and impaired patient-reported cognition among cancer survivors post-chemotherapy compared with healthy controls,"  Background  Patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy have reported cognitive impairments, which may last years after completion of treatment. Working memory- and long-term memory-related changes in this population are not well understood. In this study we aimed to demonstrate that cancer-related cognitive impairments are associated with under recruitment brain regions involved in working and recognition memory compared to controls.    Method  Oncology patients (n=15) receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with evidence of cognitive impairment by neuropsychological testing and self-report and age/education group-matched, cognitively normal controls (n=14) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During fMRI scanning, participants performed a non-verbal n-back working memory task and a visual recognition task.    Results  On the working memory task, when 1-back and 2-back data were averaged and contrasted with 0-back data, significantly reduced activation was observed in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for oncology patients versus controls. On the recognition task, oncology patients displayed decreased activity of left-middle hippocampus compared to controls. Neuroimaging results were not associated with patient-reported cognition.    Conclusion  Decreased recruitment of brain regions associated with working and recognition memory encoding were observed in the oncology group. These results suggest reduced neural functioning post-chemotherapy and corroborate patient-reported cognitive difficulties following cancer treatment, though a direct association was not observed.

0.896223113,26156005,Preferred and actual place of death in haematological malignancy,"Objectives Home is considered the preferred place of death for many, but patients with haematological malignancies (leukaemias, lymphomas and myeloma) die in hospital more often than those with other cancers and the reasons for this are not wholly understood. We examined preferred and actual place of death among people with these diseases. Methods The study is embedded within an established population-based cohort of patients with haematological malignancies. All patients diagnosed at two of the largest hospitals in the study area between May 2005 and April 2008 with acute myeloid leukaemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or myeloma, who died before May 2010 were included. Data were obtained from medical records and routine linkage to national death records. Results 323 deceased patients were included. A total of 142 (44%) had discussed their preferred place of death; 45.8% wanted to die at home, 28.2% in hospital, 16.9% in a hospice, 5.6% in a nursing home and 3.5% were undecided; 63.4% of these died in their preferred place. Compared to patients with evidence of a discussion, those without were twice as likely to have died within a month of diagnosis (14.8% vs 29.8%). Overall, 240 patients died in hospital; those without a discussion were significantly more likely to die in hospital than those who had (p‚â§0.0001). Of those dying in hospital, 90% and 75.8% received haematology clinical input in the 30 and 7‚ÄÖdays before death, respectively, and 40.8% died in haematology areas. Conclusions Many patients discussed their preferred place of death, but a substantial proportion did not and hospital deaths were common in this latter group. There is scope to improve practice, particularly among those dying soon after diagnosis. We found evidence that some people opted to die in hospital; the extent to which this compares with other cancers is of interest.",BMJ supportive & palliative care,CLINIC

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in many autoimmune skin diseases. We determined the possible role of MIF in the pathogenesis of vitiligo vulgaris, and describe the relationship between MIF expressions and disease severity and activity. Serum MIF concentrations and mRNA levels in PBMCs were measured in 44 vitiligo vulgaris patients and 32 normal controls, using ELISA and real-time RT-PCR. Skin biopsies from 15 patients and 6 controls were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Values are reported as median (25th-75th percentile). Serum MIF concentrations were significantly increased in patients [35.81 (10.98-43.66) ng/mL] compared to controls [7.69 (6.01-9.03) ng/mL]. MIF mRNA levels were significantly higher in PBMCs from patients [7.17 (3.59-8.87)] than controls [1.67 (1.23-2.42)]. There was also a significant difference in MIF mRNA levels in PBMCs between progressive and stable patients [7.86 (5.85-9.13) vs 4.33 (2.23-8.39)] and in serum MIF concentrations [40.47 (27.71-46.79) vs 26.80 (10.55-36.07) ng/mL]. In addition, the vitiligo area severity index scores of patients correlated positively with changes of both serum MIF concentrations (r = 0.488) and MIF mRNA levels in PBMCs (r = 0.426). MIF mRNA levels were significantly higher in lesional than in normal skin [2.43 (2.13-7.59) vs 1.18 (0.94-1.83)] and in patients in the progressive stage than in the stable stage [7.52 (2.43-8.84) vs 2.13 (1.98-2.64)].

0.632699301,25886337,The recovery time of sevoflurane and desflurane and the effects of anesthesia on mental and psychomotor functions and pain,"Background: Inhalation anesthetics have many advantages for outpatient general anesthesia, such as minimal postoperative side-effects and rapid and full recovery. The aim of this randomized study was to compare the postoperative recovery time of sevoflurane and desflurane and to observe the effects of anesthesia on mental, psychomotor and cognitive functions and pain in outpatients undergoing arthroscopic surgery. Patients and Methods: This study included 40 American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II patients who were divided into two groups via sealed envelopes. For maintenance of anesthesia, a mixture of 66% N 2 O and 33% O 2 and 4‚Äì7% desflurane was used in Group D, and a mixture of 66% N 2 O and 33% O 2 and 1‚Äì2.5% sevoflurane was used in Group S. The modified Aldrete score (MAS) was evaluated postoperatively at time points determined previously. An MAS of 8 or higher was considered to indicate alertness. Mental and psychomotor functions of the patients were evaluated using the short cognitive examination (SCE), and postoperative pain levels were evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: There was no difference between the groups in terms of demographic data ( P > 0.05). The mean time to reach MAS 8, eye-opening, and orientation were higher in Group S as compared to Group D ( P < 0.01). The mean MAS initially and at 5 and 10 min was higher in Group D as compared to Group S ( P < 0.001). The mean SCE at 5 and 15 min was higher in Group D as compared to Group S ( P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of VAS scores ( P > 0.05). Conclusion: It has been determined that desflurane provided better quality and more rapid recovery than sevoflurane, and the return of cognitive functions in the early postoperative period was faster. In conclusion, both agents can apparently be used safely in outpatient anesthetic procedures.","Anesthesia, essays and researches",CLINIC
0.086587955,30306195,Assessing the Genetic Correlations Between Blood Plasma Proteins and Osteoporosis: A Polygenic Risk Score Analysis," Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease. The impact of global blood plasma proteins on the risk of osteoporosis remains elusive now. We performed a large-scale polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis to evaluate the potential effects of blood plasma proteins on the development of osteoporosis in 2286 Caucasians, including 558 males and 1728 females. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone areas at ulna & radius, hip, and spine were measured using Hologic 4500W DXA. BMD/bone areas values were adjusted for age, sex, height, and weight as covariates. Genome-wide SNP genotyping of 2286 Caucasian subjects was performed using Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0. The 267 blood plasma proteins-associated SNP loci and their genetic effects were obtained from recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a highly multiplexed aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform. The polygenetic risk score (PRS) of study subjects for each blood plasma protein was calculated from the genotypes data of the 2286 Caucasian subjects by PLINK software. Pearson correlation analysis of individual PRS values and BMD/bone area value was performed using R. Additionally, gender-specific analysis also was performed by Pearson correlation analysis. 267 blood plasma proteins were analyzed in this study. For BMD, we observed association signals between 41 proteins and BMD, mainly including whole body total BMD versus Factor H ( p value = 9.00 √ó 10 ‚àí3 ), whole body total BMD versus BGH3 ( p value = 1.40 √ó 10 ‚àí2 ), spine total BMD versus IGF-I ( p value = 2.15 √ó 10 ‚àí2 ), and spine total BMD versus SAP ( p value = 3.90 √ó 10 ‚àí2 ). As for bone areas, association evidence was observed between 45 blood plasma proteins and bone areas, such as ferritin versus spine area ( p value = 1.90 √ó 10 ‚àí2 ), C4 versus hip area ( p value = 1.25 √ó 10 ‚àí2 ), and hemoglobin versus right ulna and radius area ( p value = 2.70 √ó 10 ‚àí2 ).

It is well established that hyperglycemia in diabetes elicits a rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production but the effect of LLLT remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether LLLT was able to improve oxidative/nitrosative stress parameters in the wound healing process in diabetic mice.    Study Design/Materials and Methods  Twenty male mice were divided into four groups: non-irradiated control (NIC), irradiated control (IC), non-irradiated and diabetic (NID), irradiated and diabetic (ID). Diabetes was induced by administration of streptozotocin. Wounds were created 120 days after the induction of diabetes in groups IC and ID and these groups were irradiated daily for 5 days (superpulsed 904 nm laser, average power 40 mW, 60 sec). All animals were sacrificed 1 day after the last irradiation and histology, collagen amount, catalase activity, nitrite and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured.    Results  Histology showed that collagen fibers were more organized in IC and ID when compared to NID group, and significant differences in collagen content were found in group ID versus NID. Catalase activity was higher in IC group compared to other groups (p < 0.001). TBARS levels were higher in IC versus NIC, but were lower in ID versus NID (p < 0.001). Nitrite was lower in both irradiated groups versus the respective non-irradiated groups (p < 0.001).    Conclusions  Delayed wound healing in diabetes is still a challenge in clinical practice with high social costs. The increased production of collagen and decreased oxidative and nitrosative stress suggests that LLLT may be a viable therapeutic alternative in diabetic wound healing.    Graphical abstract     LLLT is an alternative treatment for use in diabetic wounds that can improves tissue oxidative profile. In this study, we used LLLT 904 nm in mouse diabetic induced to investigate the effects of lasertherapy on oxidative stress. We believe that LLLT not only enhances mitochondrial respiration, but also activates the redox-sensitive NFkB signaling via generation of ROS.

Of many 16p11.2 genes, Kctd13 has been implicated as a major driver of neurodevelopmental phenotypes 8 , 9 . The function of KCTD13 in the mammalian brain, however, remains unknown. Here we delete the Kctd13 gene in mice and demonstrate reduced synaptic transmission. Reduced synaptic transmission correlates with increased levels of Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), a KCTD13/CUL3 ubiquitin ligase substrate, and is reversed by RhoA inhibition, suggesting increased RhoA as an important mechanism. In contrast to a previous knockdown study 8 , deletion of Kctd13 or kctd13 does not increase brain size or neurogenesis in mice or zebrafish, respectively. These findings implicate Kctd13 in the regulation of neuronal function relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and clarify the role of Kctd13 in neurogenesis and brain size. Our data also reveal a potential role for RhoA as a therapeutic target in disorders associated with KCTD13 deletion. ",Nature,BIOCHEM

In this study, we investigated the accumulation patterns of 69 PCB congeners in the blood of Yusho patients in comparison with those of non-exposed controls. The blood samples were collected at medical check-ups in 2004 and 2005. To compare the patterns of PCB congeners, we calculated the concentration ratio of each congener relative to the 2,2‚Ä≤,4,4‚Ä≤,5,5‚Ä≤-hexaCB (CB153) concentration. The con- centration ratios of tetra- and penta-chlorinated congeners in the blood of Yusho patients were significantly lower than those of controls. To examine the cytochrome P450 (CYP)- dependent metabolic potential of the 2,3‚Ä≤,4,4‚Ä≤5-pentaCB (CB118), CB153, and 2,3,3‚Ä≤,4,4‚Ä≤5-hexaCB (CB156) congeners, we conducted PCB-CYP (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, and CYP2B6) docking simulation by in silico analysis. The docking models showed that human CYP1A1, CYP2A6, and CYP2B6 isozymes have the potential to metabolize CB118 and CB153. On the other hand, it was inferred that CB156 is difficult to be metabolized by these four CYP isozymes. These results indicate that CYP1 and CYP2 isozymes may be involved in the characteristic accumulation patterns of PCB congeners in the blood of Yusho patients.

0.435363198,30206135,Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is a major source of GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide production," Phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes hydrolyze the plasma membrane (PM) lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P 2 ) to generate the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP 3 ) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to receptor activation in almost all mammalian cells. We previously found that stimulation of G protein‚Äìcoupled receptors (GPCRs) in cardiac cells leads to the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi, a process required for the activation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) during cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that GPCR-stimulated PLC activation leading to direct PI4P hydrolysis may be a general mechanism for DAG production. We measured GPCR activation‚Äìdependent changes in PM and Golgi PI4P pools in various cells using GFP-based detection of PI4P. Stimulation with various agonists caused a time-dependent reduction in PI4P-associated, but not PI4,5P 2 -associated, fluorescence at the Golgi and PM. Targeted depletion of PI4,5P 2 from the PM before GPCR stimulation had no effect on the depletion of PM or Golgi PI4P, total inositol phosphate (IP) production, or PKD activation. In contrast, acute depletion of PI4P specifically at the PM completely blocked the GPCR-dependent production of IPs and activation of PKD but did not change the abundance of PI4,5P 2 . Acute depletion of Golgi PI4P had no effect on these processes. These data suggest that most of the PM PI4,5P 2 pool is not involved in GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that PI4P at the PM is responsible for the bulk of receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DAG production.

To achieve a valid liver stiffness evaluation (LSE) the operator must obtain all the following three criteria: (1) ‚â•10 successful liver stiffness measurements; (2) IQR/median ratio <0.30 and (3) ‚â•60% measurement success rate. Objectives To assess the operator training requirements and the importance of adhering to the LSE validity criteria in routine clinical practice. Methods We retrospectively analysed the LSE validity rates of 2311 Fibroscans performed (1 August 2008 to 31 July 2011) in our tertiary liver outpatients department at the University Hospital Birmingham, UK. The diagnostic accuracy of Fibroscan was assessed in 153 patients, by comparing LSE (valid and invalid) with the modified Ishak fibrosis stage on liver biopsy. Results Learning curve analysis highlighted that the greatest improvement in validity of LSE rates occurs in the operator‚Äôs first 10 Fibroscans, reaching 64.7% validity by the 50th Fibroscan. The correlation between LSE and the fibrosis stage on liver biopsy was superior in patients with a valid LSE (n=97) compared with those with an invalid LSE (n=56) (r s 0.577 vs 0.259; p=0.022). Area under receiving operating characteristics for significant fibrosis was greater when LSE was valid (0.83 vs 0.66; p=0.048). Using an LSE cut-off of 8‚ÄÖkPa, the negative predictive value of valid LSE was superior to invalid LSE for the detection of significant (84% vs 71%) and advanced fibrosis (100% vs 93%). Conclusions Fibroscan requires minimal operator training (‚â•10 observed on patients), and when a valid LSE is obtained, it is an accurate tool for excluding advanced liver fibrosis. To ensure the diagnostic accuracy of Fibroscan it is essential that the recommended LSE validity criteria are adhered to in routine clinical practice.",Postgraduate medical journal,CLINIC

Here we show that the incidence of these carcinomas drops gradually in the course of backcrossing to the FVB/N background. Microsatellite analyses indicate that this cancer phenotype is linked to a 20‚ÄâMb region of 129P2 chromosome 15 harboring the Wnt7b gene, which is preferentially expressed from the 129P2 allele in skin carcinomas and derived cell lines. ChIPseq analysis shows enrichment of H3K27-Ac, a mark for active enhancers, in the 5‚Äô region of the Wnt7b 129P2 gene. The Wnt7b 129P2 allele appears sufficient to cause in vitro transformation of Cdkn2ab -deficient cell lines primarily through CDK6 activation. These results point to a critical role of the Cdkn2ab locus in keeping the oncogenic potential of physiological levels of WNT signaling in check and illustrate that GWAS-based searches for cancer predisposing allelic variants can be enhanced by including defined somatically¬†acquired lesions as an additional input.

0.934116094,25929283,Cellular hallmarks reveal restricted aerobic metabolism at thermal limits,"All organisms live within a given thermal range, but little is known about the mechanisms setting the limits of this range. We uncovered cellular features exhibiting signature changes at thermal limits in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. These included changes in embryo size and shape, which were also observed in Caenorhabditis briggsae , indicating evolutionary conservation. We hypothesized that such changes could reflect restricted aerobic capacity at thermal limits. Accordingly, we uncovered that relative respiration in C. elegans embryos decreases at the thermal limits as compared to within the thermal range. Furthermore, by compromising components of the respiratory chain, we demonstrated that the reliance on aerobic metabolism is reduced at thermal limits. Moreover, embryos thus compromised exhibited signature changes in size and shape already within the thermal range. We conclude that restricted aerobic metabolism at the thermal limits contributes to setting the thermal range in a metazoan organism.

The cells of most organisms need oxygen to produce chemical energy from sugars in a process called respiration. Within their normal temperature range, cells in the body of an organism are adapted to be able to take up sufficient oxygen to produce the energy they need. However, if the temperature rises above or falls below the limits of this range, the uptake of oxygen into cells may work less efficiently. Neves et al. tested this idea by studying the embryos of two different species of nematode worms grown at the limits of their respective temperature ranges. This led to several changes in the appearance of the embryos. For example, the embryos were larger than normal when grown at the lower end of their temperature ranges, but were smaller when grown at temperatures close to their upper limit. Shape changes were also seen: the embryos of both species were longer when grown at higher temperatures, a change that increases their surface area relative to their volume and may improve their ability to take up oxygen. Further experiments showed that disrupting respiration in the worms could lead to similar size and shape changes within the thermal range. Neves et al.'s findings provide experimental support that respiration plays an important role in setting the temperature ranges in which organisms can live. The next challenge will be to identify the genes that influence the capacity of respiration in these cells, which may help to explain how particular species have adapted to specific environments.

The low xylose and negligible mannose content of the cladode biomass used in this study suggested that the hemicellulose structure of the O . ficus - indica cladode was atypical of hardwood or softwood hemicelluloses. Separate hydrolysis and fermentation and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation procedures using Kluyveromyces marxianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 40 and 35¬†¬∞C, respectively, gave similar ethanol yields under non-aerated conditions. In oxygen-limited cultures K . marxianus exhibited almost double the ethanol productivity compared to non-aerated cultures, although after sugar depletion utilization of the produced ethanol was evident. Ethanol concentrations of up to 19.5 and 20.6¬†g¬†l ‚àí1 were obtained with K . marxianus and S . cerevisiae , respectively, representing 66 and 70¬†% of the theoretical yield on total sugars in the hydrolysate. Because of the low xylan content of the cladode biomass, a yeast capable of xylose fermentation might not be a prerequisite for ethanol production. K . marxianus , therefore, has potential as an alternative to S . cerevisiae for bioethanol production. However, the relatively low concentration of fermentable sugars in the O . ficus - indica cladode hydrolysate presents a technical constraint for commercial exploitation.",World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,ENG
0.763396668,28050129,What You Do Not Know Could Hurt You: What Women Wish Their Doctors Had Told Them About Chemotherapy Side Effects on Memory and Response to Alcohol,"For many patients, a cancer diagnosis is followed by chemotherapy treatment, which works by attacking cells that are growing and dividing throughout the body. Although cancer cells grow and divide more quickly than healthy cells, both are targets. The loss of healthy cells is associated with side effects, such as memory loss and altered response to a variety of food and drugs. In this pilot study, we use the ‚ÄúSurvey of female cancer treatments, effects on memory and alcohol awareness‚Äù to explore trends in female experience and awareness of side effects associated with chemotherapy. We examined 79 female cancer patients, 46 Spanish-speaking women in Puerto Rico and 33 English-speaking women in the continental United States, and compared the rates of a reported memory loss or an altered ethanol response following chemotherapy, whether or not potential side effects were discussed with a medical professional, and whether they experienced changes in alcohol consumption after treatment. A majority of participants reported having experienced short-term memory loss postchemotherapy. Changes in response to alcohol and an altered sensitivity to alcohol were also reported by 25%‚Äì47% of the respondents. Additionally, more than half of all female cancer patients reported that they wished they would have received information on the side effects of chemotherapy and secondary medications prior to treatment. The survey results suggest that medical professionals are not adequately informing women of common, potentially harmful side effects of chemotherapy. Women do wish to be more educated about potential side effects related to memory and alcohol and be given the opportunity to discuss potential outcomes with a medical professional prior to treatment to reduce the negative impact of treatment-related side effects on posttreatment quality of life.",Breast cancer : basic and clinical research,CLINIC
0.308311903,24188386,"Morphological, cytological and metabolic consequences of autopolyploidization in  Hylocereus  (Cactaceae) species","Background Genome doubling may have multi-level effects on the morphology, viability and physiology of polyploids compared to diploids. We studied the changes associated with autopolyploidization in two systems of somatic newly induced polyploids, diploid-autotetraploid and triploid-autohexaploid, belonging to the genus Hylocereus (Cactaceae). Stomata, fruits, seeds, embryos, and pollen were studied. Fruit pulp and seeds were subjected to metabolite profiling using established gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) Q-TOF-MS/MS (time of flight)-protocols. Results Autopolyploid lines produced lower numbers of tetrads, larger pollen grains with lower viability, larger stomata with lower density, and smaller fruits with lower seed numbers and decreased seed viability. The abundance of sugars was lower in the fruits and seeds of the two duplicated lines than in their donor lines, accompanied by increased contents of amino acids, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, organic acids and flavonoids. Betacyanins, the major fruit pigments in diploid and triploid donors, decreased following genome doubling. Both autopolyploid Hylocereus lines thus exhibited unfavorable changes, with the outcome being more dramatic in the autohexaploid than in the autotetraploid line. Conclusion Induced autotetraploid and autohexaploid lines exhibited morphological and cytological characteristics that differed from those of their donor plants and that were accompanied by significant metabolic alterations. It is suggested that a developmental arrest occurs in the fruits of the autohexaploid line, since their pericarp shows a greater abundance of acids and of reduced sugars. We conclude that genome doubling does not necessarily confer a fitness advantage and that the extent of alterations induced by autopolyploidization depends on the genetic background of the donor genotype.",BMC plant biology,ANIMAL
0.980389637,24700547,The Genetic Population Structure of Wild Western Lowland Gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla gorilla ) Living in Continuous Rain Forest," To understand the evolutionary histories and conservation potential of wild animal species it is useful to assess whether taxa are genetically structured into different populations and identify the underlying factors responsible for any clustering. Landscape features such as rivers may influence genetic population structure, and analysis of structure by sex can further reveal effects of sex-specific dispersal. Using microsatellite genotypes obtained from noninvasively collected fecal samples we investigated the population structure of 261 western lowland gorillas (WLGs) ( Gorilla gorilla gorilla ) from seven locations spanning an approximately 37,000km 2 region of mainly continuous rain forest within Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo and Cameroon. We found our sample to consist of two or three significantly differentiated clusters. The boundaries of the clusters coincided with courses of major rivers. Moreover, geographic distance detoured around rivers better-explained variation in genetic distance than straight line distance. Together these results suggest that major rivers in our study area play an important role in directing WLG gene flow. The number of clusters did not change when males and females were analyzed separately, indicating a lack of greater philopatry in WLG females than males at this scale.

0.85465442,30779956,The CNTNAP2-CASK complex modulates GluA1 subcellular distribution in interneurons," GABAergic interneurons are emerging as prominent substrates in the pathophysiology of multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. Interneuron excitatory activity is influenced by 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid receptors (AMPARs), which in turn affects excitatory transmission in the central nervous system. Yet how dysregulation of interneuronal AMPARs distinctly contributes to the molecular underpinning of neurobiological disease is drastically underexplored. Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) is a neurexin-related adhesion molecule shown to mediate AMPAR subcellular distribution while calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) is a multi-functional scaffold involved with glutamate receptor trafficking. Mutations in both genes have overlapping disease associations, including autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, and epilepsy, thus suggesting converging perturbations of excitatory/inhibitory balance. Our lab has previously shown that CNTNAP2 stabilizes interneuron dendritic arbors through CASK and that CNTNAP2 regulates AMPAR subunit GluA1 trafficking in excitatory neurons. The interaction between these three proteins, however, has not been studied in interneurons. Using biochemical techniques, structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and shRNA technology, we first confirm that these three proteins interact in mouse brain, and then examined relationship between CNTNAP2, CASK and GluA1 in mature interneurons. Using SIM, we ascertain that a large fraction of endogenous CNTNAP2, CASK, and GluA1 molecules collectively colocalize together in a tripartite manner. Finally, individual knockdown of either CNTNAP2 or CASK similarly alter GluA1 levels and localization. These findings offer insight to molecular mechanisms underlying GluA1 regulation in interneurons. ",Neuroscience letters,NEURO

0.629678774,19188574,Incidence and remaining lifetime risk of Parkinson disease in advanced age,"  Objective  To estimate the incidence and lifetime risk (LTR) of Parkinson disease (PD) in a large cohort of men.    Background  Age is the strongest risk factor for PD, but whether its incidence continues to in-crease after age 80 years remains unclear.    Methods  Prospective cohort of 21,970 US male physicians aged 40‚Äì84 years at baseline who did not report PD before study entry. Participants self-reported PD on yearly follow-up questionnaires, and all deaths were confirmed. We calculated incidence rates and cumulative incidence using a modified Kaplan‚ÄìMeier analysis. LTR was estimated by adjusting cumulative incidence for competing risks of death.    Results  Five hundred sixty-three cases of PD were identified over 23 years of follow-up. The crude incidence rate of PD was 121 cases/100,000 person-years. Age-specific incidence rates increased sharply beginning at age 60 years, peaked in those aged 85‚Äì89 years, and declined beginning at age 90 years. Cumulative incidence substantially overestimated the long-term risk of PD, particularly in those aged 80 years and older. Cumulative incidence was 9.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.48%‚Äì11.30%) from ages 45 to 100 years, whereas LTR for the same period was 6.7% (95% CI 6.01%‚Äì7.43%). The incidence and LTR of PD decreased with increasing exposure to smoking.    Conclusions  Our study provides evidence that the incidence of Parkinson disease (PD) in men increases through age 89 years. Whether the subsequent decline represents a true decrease in risk remains to be established. A history of smoking substantially decreased the incidence and lifetime risk of PD. Incidence studies that do not adjust for competing risks of death may overestimate the true risk of PD in the elderly.  ",Neurology,NEURO
0.676049567,30687580,Motion and Noise Artifact-Resilient Atrial Fibrillation Detection using a Smartphone," We have recently found that our previously-developed atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm for smartphones can give false positives when subjects‚Äô fingers or hands move, as we rely on proper finger placement over the smartphone camera to collect the signal of interest. Specifically, smartphone camera pulsatile signals that are obtained from normal sinus rhythm (NSR) subjects but are corrupted by motion and noise artifacts (MNAs) are frequently detected as AF. AF and motion-corrupted episodes have the similar characteristic that pulse-to-pulse intervals (PPIs) are irregular. We have developed an MNA-resilient smartphone-based AF detection algorithm that first discriminates and eliminates MNA-corrupted episodes in smartphone camera recordings, and then detects AF in MNA-free recordings. We found that MNA-corrupted episodes have highly-varying pulse slope, large turning point ratio, or large kurtosis values in smartphone signals compared to MNA-free AF and NSR episodes. We first use these three metrics for MNA discrimination and exclusion. Then, AF is detected in MNA-free signals using our previous algorithm. The capability to discriminate MNAs and AFs separately in smartphone signals increases the specificity of AF detection. To evaluate the performance of the proposed MNA-resilient AF algorithm, 99 subjects, including 88 study participants with AF at baseline and in NSR after electrical cardioversion as well as 11 participants with MNA-corrupted NSR, were recruited. Using iPhone 4S, 5S, and 6S models, we collected 2-minute pulsatile time series from each subject. The clinical results show that the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the proposed AF algorithm are 0.97, 0.98, 0.97, respectively, which are higher than those of the previous AF algorithm.

Within 4 weeks we progressed from B cell isolation to a panel of unique monoclonal antibodies, including seven that displayed broad reactivity to different clinically relevant influenza hemagglutinin subtypes. Most isolated antibody sequences were not detected by next-generation sequencing of the paired repertoire, illustrating how this method can isolate extremely rare leads not likely found by existing technologies.

However, the functions of Maf TFs in MGE development remain to be elucidated. Herein, Mafb and c-Maf were conditionally deleted, alone and together, in the MGE and its lineages. Analyses of Maf mutant mice revealed redundant functions of Mafb and c-Maf in secondary MGE progenitors, where they repress the generation of SST + cortical and hippocampal interneurons. By contrast, Mafb and c-Maf have distinct roles in postnatal cortical interneuron (CIN) morphological maturation, synaptogenesis, and cortical circuit integration. Thus, Mafb and c-Maf have redundant and opposing functions at different steps in CIN development.   Graphical Abstract      In Brief  Using mouse genetics and ex vivo physiology studies, Pai et al. show that Mafb and c-Maf together are necessary to generate the proper numbers of parvalbumin and somatostatin GABAergic interneurons. However, in maturing interneurons, Mafb and c-Maf function divergently to control their firing properties and communication with other neurons. ",Cell reports,BIOCHEM
0.56189507,23798742,Gender inequalities in the promptness of diagnosis of bladder and renal cancer after symptomatic presentation: evidence from secondary analysis of an English primary care audit survey,"Objectives To explore whether women experience greater delays in the diagnosis of bladder and renal cancer when first presenting to a general practitioner with symptoms caused by those cancers and potential reasons for such gender inequalities. Design Prospective national audit survey of cancer diagnosis. Setting English primary care (2009‚Äì2010). Participants 920 patients with bladder and 398 patients with renal cancer (252 (27%) and 165 (42%), respectively, were women). Primary and secondary outcome measures Proportion of patients with three or more pre-referral consultations; number of days from first presentation to referral; proportion of patients who presented with haematuria and proportion of patients investigated in primary care. Results Women required three or more prereferral consultations more often than men (27% (95% CI 21% to 33%) vs 11% (9% to 14%) for bladder (p<0.001); and 30% (22% to 39%) vs 18% (13% to 25%) for renal cancer (p=0.025)) and had a greater number of days from presentation to referral. In multivariable analysis (adjusting for age, haematuria status and use of primary care-led investigations), being a woman was independently associated with higher odds of three or more pre-referral consultations (OR=3.29 (2.06 to 5.25, p<0.001) for bladder cancer; and OR=1.90 (1.06 to 3.42, p=0.031) for renal cancer). Although presentation with haematuria was associated with more timely diagnosis of bladder cancer, gender inequalities did not vary by haematuria status for either cancer (p=0.18 for bladder and p=0.27 for renal). Each year in the UK, approximately 700 women with either bladder or renal cancer experience a delayed diagnosis because of their gender, of whom more than a quarter (197, or 28%) present with haematuria.

0.744353046,23286036,Hierarchical Attribute-Guided Symmetric Diffeomorphic Registration for MR Brain Images," Deformable registration has been widely used in neuroscience studies for spatial normalization of brain images onto a standard space. Due to high anatomical variances across individual brains, registration performance could be limited when trying to estimate entire deformation pathway either from template to subject or subject to template. Symmetric image registration offers an effective way to simultaneously deform template and subject images towards each other until they meet at the middle point. Although some intensity-based registration algorithms have nicely incorporated this concept of symmetric deformation, the intensity matching between two images may not necessarily imply the correct matching of anatomical correspondences. In this paper, we integrate both strategies of hierarchical attribute matching and symmetric diffeomorphic deformation for building a new symmetric-diffeomorphic registration algorithm for MR brain images. The performance of our proposed method has been extensively evaluated and further compared with top-ranked image registration methods (SyN and diffeomorphic Demons) on brain MR images. In all experiments, our registration method achieves the best registration performance, compared to all other state-of-the-art registration methods.

0.71852258,26441864,Interplay between the alpharetroviral Gag protein and SR proteins SF2 and SC35 in the nucleus,"Retroviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that reverse transcribe their RNA genomes into double-stranded DNA for integration into the host cell chromosome. The integrated provirus is used as a template for the transcription of viral RNA. The full-length viral RNA can be used for the translation of the Gag and Gag-Pol structural proteins or as the genomic RNA (gRNA) for encapsidation into new virions by the Gag protein. The mechanism by which Gag selectively incorporates unspliced gRNA into virus particles is poorly understood. Although Gag was previously thought to localize exclusively to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane where particles are released, we found that the Gag protein of Rous sarcoma virus, an alpharetrovirus, undergoes transient nuclear trafficking. When the nuclear export signal of RSV Gag is mutated (Gag.L219A), the protein accumulates in discrete subnuclear foci reminiscent of nuclear bodies such as splicing speckles, paraspeckles, and PML bodies. In this report, we observed that RSV Gag.L219A foci appeared to be tethered in the nucleus, partially co-localizing with the splicing speckle components SC35 and SF2. Overexpression of SC35 increased the number of Gag.L219A nucleoplasmic foci, suggesting that SC35 may facilitate the formation of Gag foci. We previously reported that RSV Gag nuclear trafficking is required for efficient gRNA packaging. Together with the data presented herein, our findings raise the intriguing hypothesis that RSV Gag may co-opt splicing factors to localize near transcription sites. Because splicing occurs co-transcriptionally, we speculate that this mechanism could allow Gag to associate with unspliced viral RNA shortly after its transcription initiation in the nucleus, before the viral RNA can be spliced or exported from the nucleus as an mRNA template.",Frontiers in microbiology,BIOCHEM
0.739512154,21106119,Sensitivity analysis of dynamic biological systems with time-delays,"Background Mathematical modeling has been applied to the study and analysis of complex biological systems for a long time. Some processes in biological systems, such as the gene expression and feedback control in signal transduction networks, involve a time delay. These systems are represented as delay differential equation (DDE) models. Numerical sensitivity analysis of a DDE model by the direct method requires the solutions of model and sensitivity equations with time-delays. The major effort is the computation of Jacobian matrix when computing the solution of sensitivity equations. The computation of partial derivatives of complex equations either by the analytic method or by symbolic manipulation is time consuming, inconvenient, and prone to introduce human errors. To address this problem, an automatic approach to obtain the derivatives of complex functions efficiently and accurately is necessary. Results We have proposed an efficient algorithm with an adaptive step size control to compute the solution and dynamic sensitivities of biological systems described by ordinal differential equations (ODEs). The adaptive direct-decoupled algorithm is extended to solve the solution and dynamic sensitivities of time-delay systems describing by DDEs. To save the human effort and avoid the human errors in the computation of partial derivatives, an automatic differentiation technique is embedded in the extended algorithm to evaluate the Jacobian matrix. The extended algorithm is implemented and applied to two realistic models with time-delays: the cardiovascular control system and the TNF- Œ± signal transduction network. The results show that the extended algorithm is a good tool for dynamic sensitivity analysis on DDE models with less user intervention. Conclusions By comparing with direct-coupled methods in theory, the extended algorithm is efficient, accurate, and easy to use for end users without programming background to do dynamic sensitivity analysis on complex biological systems with time-delays.",BMC bioinformatics,CS

In this study, we investigated the contribution of Isl1 -expressing cells that utilize the Œ≤-catenin pathway to skeletal development. Inactivation of Œ≤-catenin in Isl1 -expressing cells caused agenesis of the hindlimb skeleton and absence of the lower jaw (agnathia). In the hindlimb, Isl1 -lineages broadly contributed to the mesenchyme, however, deletion of Œ≤-catenin in the Isl1 -lineage caused cell death only in a discrete posterior domain of nascent hindlimb bud mesenchyme. We found that the loss of posterior mesenchyme, which gives rise to Shh -expressing posterior organizer tissue, caused loss of posterior gene expression and failure to expand chondrogenic precursor cells, leading to severe truncation of the hindlimb. In facial tissues, Isl1 -expressing cells broadly contributed to facial epithelium. We found reduced nuclear Œ≤-catenin accumulation and loss of Fgf8 expression in mandibular epithelium of Isl1 ‚àí/‚àí embryos. Inactivating Œ≤-catenin in Isl1 -expressing epithelium caused both loss of epithelial Fgf8 expression and death of mesenchymal cells in the mandibular arch without affecting epithelial proliferation and survival. These results suggest a Isl1 -> Œ≤-catenin -> Fgf8 pathway that regulates mesenchymal survival and development of the lower jaw in the mandibular epithelium. By contrast, activating Œ≤-catenin signaling in Isl1 -lineages caused activation of Fgf8 broadly in facial epithelium. Our results provide evidence that, despite its broad contribution to hindlimb mesenchyme and facial epithelium, the Isl1 -Œ≤-catenin pathway regulates skeletal development of the hindlimb and lower jaw through discrete populations of cells that give rise to Shh -expressing posterior hindlimb mesenchyme and Fgf8 -expressing mandibular epithelium.

After controlling for 9th grade test scores and family and other school-level characteristics, we find that first-generation immigrant youth generally have higher 11th grade test scores and lower probability of dropping out compared to native-born students who are second or third generation. Greater levels of parental engagement predict superior test scores and lower rates of dropout for youth of various racial and immigrant generation backgrounds, even in the presence of a variety of controls.

In this study we attempted to determine a threshold to engage serotonergic neurons in the DR following exposure to aversive conditions in an anxiety-related behavioral test. We manipulated the intensity of anxiogenic stimuli in studies of male Wistar rats by leaving them undisturbed (CO), briefly handling them (HA), or exposing them to an open-field arena for 15-min under low-light (LL: 8-13 lux) or high-light (HL: 400-500 lux) conditions. Rats exposed to HL conditions responded with reduced locomotor activity, reduced time spent exploring the center of the arena, a lower frequency of rearing and grooming, and an increased frequency of facing the corner of the arena compared to LL rats. Rats exposed to HL conditions had small but significant increases in c-Fos expression within serotonergic neurons in subdivisions of the rostral DR. Exposure to HL conditions did not alter c-Fos responses in serotonergic neurons in any other DR subdivision. In contrast, rats exposed to the open-field arena had increased c-Fos expression in non-serotonergic cells throughout the DR compared to CO rats, and this effect was particularly apparent in the dorsolateral part of the DR. We conclude that exposure to HL conditions, compared to LL conditions, increased anxiety-related behavioral responses in an open-field arena but this stimulus was at or below the threshold required to increase c-Fos expression in serotonergic neurons.

0.547155588,22510482,Association between polymorphism in the  FTO  gene and growth and carcass traits in pig crosses,"Background Independent studies have shown that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the human FTO ( fat mass and obesity associated ) gene are associated with obesity. SNP have also been identified in the pig FTO gene, among which some are associated with selected fat-deposition traits in F 2 crosses and commercial populations. In this study, using both commercial pig populations and an experimental Meishan √ó Pietrain F 2 population, we have investigated the association between one FTO SNP and several growth and carcass traits. Association analyses were performed with the FTO polymorphism either alone or in combination with polymorphisms in flanking loci. Methods SNP (FM244720:g.400C>G) in exon 3 of porcine FTO was genotyped by PCR-RFLP and tested for associations with some growth, carcass and fat-related traits. Proportions of genetic variance of four pig chromosome 6 genes ( FTO , RYR1 , LIPE and TGFB1 ) on selected traits were evaluated using single- and multi-locus models. Results Linkage analysis placed FTO on the p arm of pig chromosome 6, approximately 22 cM from RYR1 . In the commercial populations, allele C of the FTO SNP was significantly associated with back fat depth and allele G with muscling traits. In the Meishan √ó Pietrain F 2 pigs, heterozygotes with allele C from the Pietrain sows and allele G from the Meishan boar were more significantly associated with fat-related traits compared to homozygotes with allele G from the Pietrain and allele G from the Meishan breed. In single- and multi-locus models, genes RYR1 , TGFB1 and FTO showed high associations. The contribution in genetic variance from the polymorphism in the FTO gene was highest for back fat depth, meat area on the musculus longissimus lumborum et thoracis tissues and metabolite glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Conclusions Our results show that in pig, FTO influences back fat depth in the commercial populations, while in the Meishan √ó Pietrain F 2 pigs with a CG genotype, heterosis occurs for several fat-related traits.","Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE",ECO

The mechanism by which KLF4 exerts these effects is not fully established. Here we investigated the expression profile of KLF4 in an inducible system over a time course of 24 h. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we determined that the fold changes relative to control in expression levels of KLF4 exhibited a time-dependent increase from 3- to 20-fold between 4 and 24 h following KLF4 induction. During this period and among a group of 473 cell cycle regulatory genes examined, 96 were positively correlated and 86 were negatively correlated to KLF4 's expression profile. Examples of upregulated cell cycle genes include those encoding tumor suppressors such as MCC and FHIT, and cell cycle inhibitors such as CHES1 and CHEK1. Examples of downregulated genes include those that promote the cell cycle including several cyclins and those required for DNA replication. Unexpectedly, several groups of genes involved in macromolecular synthesis, including protein biosynthesis, transcription, and cholesterol biosynthesis, were also significantly inhibited by KLF4. Thus, KLF4 exerts a global inhibitory effect on macromolecular biosynthesis that is beyond its established role as a cell cycle inhibitor. ",Gene expression,BIOCHEM

The significance of prostate size on pathologic and functional outcomes in patients undergoing robotic prostatectomy,"Background We examined the effect of prostate weight on perioperative data, and the pathological and functional outcomes of robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Patients and methods Data were available from 716 consecutive patients before, during and after undergoing RALP at one institution. Prostate size was arbitrarily stratified by recorded prostate weight into <50, 50‚Äì80 and >80¬†g, corresponding to small, moderate and large glands, respectively. Perioperative data and the histopathological and functional outcomes were compared across these groups by both univariable and multivariable-adjusted analyses. Results Increased prostate size was associated with increased age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels, body mass index, operative duration, blood loss, lower biopsy and pathological Gleason scores, and lower pathological staging ( P <¬†0.05). The incidence of extensive positive surgical margins was 14.8%, 9.7%, and 5.3% in small, moderate and large prostates, respectively ( P <¬†0.001). However, after multivariable adjustment, only Gleason score and pathological stage were significantly associated with the incidence of positive margins ( P <¬†0.05); prostate weight was not significantly associated. Overall, 78% and 92% of patients were potent and continent at 12¬†months, respectively, which was not affected by prostate size. Conclusion Patients with larger prostates had favourable pathological outcomes after RALP. When controlling for pathological stage, prostate size was not associated with margin positivity. Functionally, neither continence nor potency at 12¬†months was affected by prostate size.",Arab journal of urology,CLINIC
0.367213912,30796313,Effects of ultraviolet treatment and alendronate immersion on osteoblast-like cells and human gingival fibroblasts cultured on titanium surfaces,"In this study, we evaluated the effects of ultraviolet (UV) treatment and alendronate (ALN) immersion on the proliferation and differentiation of MG-63 osteoblast-like cells and human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) cultured on titanium surfaces. MG-63 cells were used for sandblasted, large grit, and acid-etched (SLA) titanium surfaces, and HGFs were used for machined (MA) titanium surfaces. SLA and MA specimens were subdivided into four groups ( n =‚Äâ12) according to the combination of surface treatments (UV treatment and/or ALN immersion) applied. After culturing MG-63 cells and HGFs on titanium discs, cellular morphology, proliferation, and differentiation were evaluated. The results revealed that UV treatment of titanium surfaces did not alter the proliferation of MG-63 cells; however, HGF differentiation and adhesion were increased in response to UV treatment. In contrast, ALN immersion of titanium discs reduced MG-63 cell proliferation and changed HGFs into a more atrophic form. Simultaneous application of UV treatment and ALN immersion induced greater differentiation of MG-63 cells. Within the limitations of this cellular level study, simultaneous application of UV treatment and ALN immersion of titanium surfaces was shown to improve the osseointegration of titanium implants; in addition, UV treatment may be used to enhance mucosal sealing of titanium abutments.",Scientific reports,BIOCHEM
0.19975512,25354190,Multi-Vendor Implementation and Comparison of Volumetric Whole-Brain Echo-Planar MR Spectroscopic Imaging,"  Purpose  To assess volumetric proton MR spectroscopic imaging of the human brain on multi-vendor MRI instruments.    Methods  Echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) was developed on instruments from three manufacturers, with matched specifications and acquisition protocols that accounted for differences in sampling performance, RF power, and data formats. Inter-site reproducibility was evaluated for signal-normalized maps of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), Creatine (Cre) and Choline using phantom and human subject measurements. Comparative analyses included metrics for spectral quality, spatial coverage, and mean values in atlas-registered brain regions.    Results  Inter-site differences for phantom measurements were under 1.7% for individual metabolites and 0.2% for ratio measurements. Spatial uniformity ranged from 79% to 91%. The human studies found differences of mean values in the temporal lobe, but good agreement in other white-matter regions, with maximum differences relative to their mean of under 3.2%. For NAA/Cre, the maximum difference was 1.8%. In grey-matter a significant difference was observed for frontal lobe NAA. Primary causes of inter-site differences were attributed to shim quality, B 0 drift, and accuracy of RF excitation. Correlation coefficients for measurements at each site were over 0.60, indicating good reliability.    Conclusion  A volumetric intensity-normalized MRSI acquisition can be implemented in a comparable manner across multi-vendor MR instruments.  ",Magnetic resonance in medicine,NEURO
0.188501821,31098302,Low-dose aspirin protective effects are correlated with deregulation of HNF factor expression in the preeclamptic placentas from mice and humans,"Aspirin (acetyl-salicylic acid) is one of the most ancient drugs of the human pharmacopeia. Nonetheless, its action at low doses is not well understood at the molecular level. One of the applications of low-dose aspirin treatment is the prevention of preeclampsia (PE) in patients at risk. Foeto-placental overexpression of the STOX1A transcription factor in mice triggers PE symptoms. Transcriptomic analysis of the placentas, showed that aspirin massively down-regulates genes of the coagulation and complement cascade, as well as genes involved in lipid transport. The genes modified by aspirin treatment are not the ones that are modified by STOX1 overexpression, suggesting that aspirin could act downstream, symptomatically on the preeclamptic disease. Bioinformatics analysis of the promoters of the deregulated genes showed that they are strongly enriched in HNF transcription factors-binding sites, in accordance with existing literature showing their roles as regulators of coagulation. Two of these transcription factors, Hnf1Œ≤ and Hnf4Œ± are found down-regulated by aspirin treatment. In parallel, we show that in human patient placentas, aspirin-induced deregulations of genes of the coagulation cascade are also observed. Finally, the expression of Hnf1Œ≤ target sequences ( Kif12 , F2 , Hnf4Œ± promoters and a synthetic concatemer of the Hnf1Œ≤-binding site) were investigated by transfection in trophoblast cell models, with or without aspirin treatment and with or without STOX1A overexpression. In this model we observed that STOX1A and aspirin tended to synergize in the down-regulation of Hnf1Œ≤ target genes in trophoblasts.",Cell death discovery,BIOCHEM

Here we show using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy that twin-grain boundaries in the layered semiconductor MoSe 2 exhibit parabolic metallic bands. The one-dimensional nature is evident from a charge density wave transition, whose periodicity is given by k F / œÄ , consistent with scanning tunnelling microscopy and angle resolved photoemission measurements. Most importantly, we provide evidence for spin- and charge-separation, the hallmark of one-dimensional quantum liquids. Our studies show that the spectral line splits into distinctive spinon and holon excitations whose dispersions exactly follow the energy-momentum dependence calculated by a Hubbard model with suitable finite-range interactions. Our results also imply that quantum wires and junctions can be isolated in line defects of other transition metal dichalcogenides, which may enable quantum transport measurements and devices. Line defects are 1D structures often embedded within 2D materials.

0.734736966,26196692,Fever Is Mediated by Conversion of Endocannabinoid 2-Arachidonoylglycerol to Prostaglandin E 2,"Fever is a common response to inflammation and infection. The mechanism involves prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 )-EP3 receptor signaling in the hypothalamus, which raises the set point of hypothalamic thermostat for body temperature, but the lipid metabolic pathway for pyretic PGE 2 production remains unknown. To reveal the molecular basis of fever initiation, we examined lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced fever model in monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL)-deficient ( Mgll  ‚àí/‚àí ) mice, CB1 receptor-MGL compound-deficient ( Cnr1  ‚àí/‚àí  Mgll  ‚àí/‚àí ) mice, cytosolic phospholipase A 2 Œ± (cPLA 2 Œ±)-deficient ( Pla2g4a  ‚àí/‚àí ) mice, and diacylglycerol lipase Œ± (DGLŒ±)-deficient ( Dagla  ‚àí/‚àí ) mice. Febrile reactions were abolished in Mgll  ‚àí/‚àí and Cnr1  ‚àí/‚àí  Mgll  ‚àí/‚àí mice, whereas Cnr1  ‚àí/‚àí  Mgll  +/+ , Pla2g4a  ‚àí/‚àí and Dagla  ‚àí/‚àí mice responded normally, demonstrating that MGL is a critical enzyme for fever, which functions independently of endocannabinoid signals. Intracerebroventricular administration of PGE 2 caused fever similarly in Mgll  ‚àí/‚àí and wild-type control mice, suggesting a lack of pyretic PGE 2 production in Mgll  ‚àí/‚àí hypothalamus, which was confirmed by lipidomics analysis. Normal blood cytokine responses after LPS administration suggested that MGL-deficiency does not affect pyretic cytokine productions. Diurnal body temperature profiles were normal in Mgll  ‚àí/‚àí mice, demonstrating that MGL is unrelated to physiological thermoregulation. In conclusion, MGL-dependent hydrolysis of endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol is necessary for pyretic PGE 2 production in the hypothalamus.",PloS one,BIOCHEM
0.560794652,25975605,Emerging optical methods for surveillance of Barrett‚Äôs oesophagus," The rapid rise in incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has motivated the need for improved methods for surveillance of Barrett‚Äôs oesophagus. Early neoplasia is flat in morphology and patchy in distribution and is difficult to detect with conventional white light endoscopy (WLE). Light offers numerous advantages for rapidly visualising the oesophagus, and advanced optical methods are being developed for wide-field and cross-sectional imaging to guide tissue biopsy and stage early neoplasia, respectively. We review key features of these promising methods and address their potential to improve detection of Barrett‚Äôs neoplasia. The clinical performance of key advanced imaging technologies is reviewed, including (1) wide-field methods, such as high-definition WLE, chromoendoscopy, narrow-band imaging, autofluorescence and trimodal imaging and (2) cross-sectional techniques, such as optical coherence tomography, optical frequency domain imaging and confocal laser endomicroscopy. Some of these instruments are being adapted for molecular imaging to detect specific biological targets that are overexpressed in Barrett‚Äôs neoplasia. Gene expression profiles are being used to identify early targets that appear before morphological changes can be visualised with white light. These targets are detected in vivo using exogenous probes, such as lectins, peptides, antibodies, affibodies and activatable enzymes that are labelled with fluorescence dyes to produce high contrast images. This emerging approach has potential to provide a ‚Äòred flag‚Äô to identify regions of premalignant mucosa, outline disease margins and guide therapy based on the underlying molecular mechanisms of cancer progression.

The aim of the present study was to use methods based on item response theory (IRT) to examine whether, when equating for levels of depression severity, there are differences in the likelihood of reporting DSM-IV symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE) between subjects with and without a lifetime history of manic symptoms.    Methods  We conducted these analyses using a large, nationally representative sample from the USA (n = 34,653), the second wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.    Results  The items sadness, appetite disturbance and psychomotor symptoms were better indicators of depression severity in participants without a lifetime history of manic symptoms, in a clinically meaningful way. DSM-IV symptoms of MDE were substantially less informative in participants with a lifetime history of manic symptoms than in those without such history.    Limitations  Clinical information on DSM-IV depressive and manic symptoms was based on retrospective self-report    Conclusions  The clinical presentation of depressive symptoms may substantially differ in individuals with and without a lifetime history of manic symptoms.

Methods  Data on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and health were collected on 1266 married women aged 15-59 years living in poor suburbs in the outskirts of Beirut, Lebanon. Independent associations with MSD of factors and characteristics were examined using odds ratios (ORs) derived from multiple logistic regression.    Results  Women‚Äôs age, weight, and number of children were significantly, positively, independently associated with self-reported MSD, while women‚Äôs conduct of specific household tasks were not. Women with MSD were more likely to be stressed than women without MSD (OR = 1.5).

The measures used to assess women‚Äôs involvement in housework did not account for the duration of time spent performing each household task. Better measures of domestic labor, including housework and childcare, are required to understand better their impact on the health of full-time homemakers and on MSD in particular.

0.716632897,26283330,Plasmodium falciparum  Gametocyte-Specific Antibody Profiling Reveals Boosting through Natural Infection and Identifies Potential Markers of Gametocyte Exposure,"Malaria elimination efforts would benefit from vaccines that block transmission of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes from humans to mosquitoes. A clear understanding of gametocyte-specific antibody responses in exposed populations could help determine whether transmission-blocking vaccines (TBV) would be boosted by natural gametocyte exposure, and also inform the development of serologic tools to monitor gametocyte exposure in populations targeted for malaria elimination. To this end, plasma was collected from Malian children and adults before and after the 6-month malaria season and probed against a microarray containing 1,204 P. falciparum proteins. Using publicly available proteomic data, we classified 91 proteins as gametocyte specific and 69 as proteins not expressed by gametocytes. The overall breadth and magnitude of gametocyte-specific IgG responses increased during the malaria season, although they were consistently lower than IgG responses to nongametocyte antigens. Notably, IgG specific for the TBV candidates Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 increased during the malaria season. In addition, IgGs specific for the gametocyte proteins Pfmdv1, Pfs16, PF3D7_1346400, and PF3D7_1024800 were detected in nearly all subjects, suggesting that seroconversion to these proteins may be a sensitive indicator of gametocyte exposure, although further studies are needed to determine the specificity and kinetics of these potential serologic markers. These findings suggest that TBV-induced immunity would be boosted through natural gametocyte exposure, and that antibody responses to particular antigens may reliably indicate gametocyte exposure.",Infection and immunity,IMMUN

Several reports exist which demonstrate the protective action of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a widely used NO donor, which acts as a signal molecule in plants responsible for the expression regulation of many antioxidant enzymes. This study attempts to provide a novel insight into the effect of application of low (100 ŒºŒú) and high (2.5 mM) concentrations of SNP on the nitrosative status and nitrate metabolism of mature (40 d) and senescing (65 d) Medicago truncatula plants. Higher concentrations of SNP resulted in increased NO content, cellular damage levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, further induced in older tissues. Senescing M. truncatula plants demonstrated greater sensitivity to SNP-induced oxidative and nitrosative damage, suggesting a developmental stage-dependent suppression in the plant‚Äôs capacity to cope with free oxygen and nitrogen radicals. In addition, measurements of the activity of nitrate reductase (NR), a key enzyme involved in the generation of NO in plants, indicated a differential regulation in a dose and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression levels of NO-responsive genes ( NR, nitrate/nitrite transporters ) involved in nitrogen assimilation and NO production revealed significant induction of NR and nitrate transporter during long-term 2.5 mM SNP application in mature plants and overall gene suppression in senescing plants, supporting the differential nitrosative response of M. truncatula plants treated with different concentrations of SNP.",Plant signaling & behavior,ANIMAL
0.984365646,9679143,"Iqg1p, a Yeast Homologue of the Mammalian IQGAPs, Mediates Cdc42p Effects on the Actin Cytoskeleton","The Rho-type GTPase Cdc42p has been implicated in diverse cellular functions including cell shape, cell motility, and cytokinesis, all of which involve the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Targets of Cdc42p that interface the actin cytoskeleton are likely candidates for mediating cellular activities. In this report, we identify and characterize a yeast homologue for the mammalian IQGAP, a cytoskeletal target for Cdc42p. The yeast IQGAP homologue, designated Iqg1p, displays a two-hybrid interaction with activated Cdc42p and coimmunoprecipitates with actin filaments. Deletion of IQG1 results in a temperature-sensitive lethality and causes aberrant morphologies including elongated and round multinucleated cells. This together with its localization at the mother‚Äìbud neck, suggest that Iqg1p promotes budding and cytokinesis. At restrictive temperatures, the vacuoles of the mutant cells enlarge and vesicles accumulate in the bud. Interestingly, Iqg1p shows two-hybrid interactions with the ankyrin repeat‚Äìcontaining protein, Akr1p (Kao, L.-R., J. Peterson, J. Ruiru, L. Bender, and A. Bender. 1996. Mol. Cell.

We also show two-hybrid interactions between Iqg1p and Afr1p, a septin-binding protein involved in projection formation (Konopka, J.B., C. DeMattei, and C. Davis. 1995. Mol. Cell. Biol . 15:723‚Äì730). We propose that Iqg1p acts as a scaffold to recruit and localize a protein complex involved in actin-based cellular functions and thus mediates the regulatory effects of Cdc42p on the actin cytoskeleton.",The Journal of cell biology,BIOCHEM

The use of adult zebrafish as a vertebrate model of cardiac disease and regeneration is increasing at high speed. It is therefore of great importance to establish appropriate and robust methods to measure cardiac function parameters. Methods and Results Here we describe the use of 2D-echocardiography to study the fractional volume shortening and segmental wall motion of the ventricle. Our data show that 2D-echocardiography can be used to evaluate cardiac injury and also to study recovery of cardiac function. Interestingly, our results show that while global systolic function recovered following cardiac cryoinjury, ventricular wall motion was only partially restored. Conclusion Cryoinjury leads to long-lasting impairment of cardiac contraction, partially mimicking the consequences of myocardial infarction in humans. Functional assessment of heart regeneration by echocardiography allows a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of cardiac regeneration and has the advantage of being easily transferable to other cardiovascular zebrafish disease models.",PloS one,ANIMAL

This study manipulated the intensity profiles of different pieces of music in order to test the causal nature of this relationship. Listeners ( N =‚Ää38) continuously rated their perceptions of the arousal expressed by each piece. An extract from Dvorak's Slavonic Dance Opus 46 No 1 was used to create a variant in which the direction of change in intensity was inverted, while other features were retained. Even though it was only intensity that was inverted, perceived arousal was also inverted. The original intensity profile was also superimposed on three new pieces of music. The time variation in the perceived arousal of all pieces was similar to their intensity profile. Time series analyses revealed that intensity variation was a major influence on the arousal perception in all pieces, in spite of their stylistic diversity.",PloS one,PSYCH
0.566449136,19758472,Correlating protein function and stability through the analysis of single amino acid substitutions,"Background Mutations resulting in the disruption of protein function are the underlying causes of many genetic diseases. Some mutations affect the number of expressed proteins while others alter the activity on a per-molecule basis. Single amino acid substitutions as caused by non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (nsSNPs) often disrupt function by altering protein structure and/or stability, but can also wreak havoc by directly impacting functional binding sites. Given the experimental three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein, we can try to differentiate between the ""effect on structure/stability"" and the ""effect on binding"". However, experimental 3D structures are available for only 1% of all known proteins; the magnitude of stability change caused by a given mutation is more widely available. Results Here, we analyze to which extent the functional effect of a mutation can be predicted from the effect on protein stability. We find that simple sequence-based methods succeed in predicting functional effects of nsSNPs. In fact, such methods consistently outperform approaches that predict functional change through the application of binary thresholds to stability change. We also observed that if stability is affected, functional change is easier to predict than when stability is not affected. Conclusion Our results confirmed that stability change is somehow related to function change. However, we also show that the knowledge of stability changes in no way suffices to predict functional changes and that many function changing mutations have no effect on stability.",BMC bioinformatics,CS

Results  A total of 52% (34 of 66 patients) of our population developed PlEf and the actuarial rates at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months were 7%, 30%, and 42%, respectively. Median time to diagnosis was five months (range 0.06‚Äì27 months). The majority of PlEfs were grade one (67%) and developed at a median of four (0.06‚Äì13) months, followed by grade two (15%) at a median 11 (5‚Äì12) months, and grade three (18%) at a median of 11 (3‚Äì27) months. On multivariate analysis, increasing HV 5 ‚ÄìHV 50 , LV 5 ‚ÄìLV 50 , MHD, and MLD were associated with greater risk of PlEf. Higher grade PlEf was also associated with higher doses of radiation to the heart, while lung DM parameters were not significantly associated with higher PlEf grades. At five-months post-CRT, MHD of 25 Gy was associated with a 100% chance of grade one PlEf, an 82% risk of grade two PlEf, and a 19% risk of grade three PlEf.    Conclusions  Post-CRT PlEf is common in NSCLC with the majority being grade one. Increasing heart and lung irradiation was associated with increased risk of PlEf. Increasing heart irradiation also correlated with development of increasing grades of PlEf. The impact of potential cardiopulmonary toxicity and resultant PlEfs after CRT requires additional study.

0.458649862,26639422,"BK Polyomavirus Replication in Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells Is Inhibited by Sirolimus, but Activated by Tacrolimus Through a Pathway Involving FKBP‚Äê12","BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) replication causes nephropathy and premature kidney transplant failure. Insufficient BKPyV‚Äêspecific T cell control is regarded as a key mechanism, but direct effects of immunosuppressive drugs on BKPyV replication might play an additional role. We compared the effects of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)‚Äê and calcineurin‚Äêinhibitors on BKPyV replication in primary human renal tubular epithelial cells. Sirolimus impaired BKPyV replication with a 90% inhibitory concentration of 4‚Äâng/mL by interfering with mTOR‚ÄìSP6‚Äêkinase activation. Sirolimus inhibition was rapid and effective up to 24‚Äâh postinfection during viral early gene expression, but not thereafter, during viral late gene expression. The mTORC‚Äê1 kinase inhibitor torin‚Äê1 showed a similar inhibition profile, supporting the notion that early steps of BKPyV replication depend on mTOR activity. Cyclosporine A also inhibited BKPyV replication, while tacrolimus activated BKPyV replication and reversed sirolimus inhibition. FK binding protein 12kda (FKBP‚Äê12) siRNA knockdown abrogated sirolimus inhibition and increased BKPyV replication similar to adding tacrolimus. Thus, sirolimus and tacrolimus exert opposite effects on BKPyV replication in renal tubular epithelial cells by a mechanism involving FKBP‚Äê12 as common target. Immunosuppressive drugs may therefore contribute directly to the risk of BKPyV replication and nephropathy besides suppressing T cell functions. The data provide rationales for clinical trials aiming at reducing the risk of BKPyV replication and disease in kidney transplantation. Comparing direct effects of immunosuppressive drugs on BK polyomavirus replication in primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, this study demonstrates that the virus is inhibited by sirolimus but activated by tacrolimus through a mechanism involving competitive binding to the small host cell protein FKBP‚Äê12.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,IMMUN

0.672730887,19935646,Cancer-associated IDH1 mutations produce 2-hydroxyglutarate," Summary  Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are a common feature of a major subset of primary human brain cancers. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of the IDH1 active site resulting in loss of the enzyme‚Äôs ability to catalyze conversion of isocitrate to Œ±-ketoglutarate. However, only a single copy of the gene is mutated in tumors, raising the possibility that the mutations do not result in a simple loss of function. Here we show that cancer-associated IDH1 mutations result in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of Œ±-ketoglutarate to R(‚àí)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Structural studies demonstrate that when R132 is mutated to histidine, residues in the active site are shifted to produce structural changes consistent with reduced oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and acquisition of the ability to convert Œ±-ketoglutarate to 2HG. Excess accumulation of 2HG has been shown to lead to an elevated risk of malignant brain tumors in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism. Similarly, in human malignant gliomas harboring IDH1 mutations, we find dramatically elevated levels of 2HG. These data demonstrate that the IDH1 mutations result in production of the onco-metabolite 2HG, and suggest that the excess 2HG which accumulates in vivo contributes to the formation and malignant progression of gliomas.

0.796391407,29357096,Associations Between Television Viewing and Adiposity Among South Asians,"  Objective  Sedentary behaviors related to television (TV) viewing are associated with adiposity; however, few investigations have focused on South Asians, an ethnicity particularly vulnerable to metabolic perturbations. This study examined the relationships between TV viewing and adiposity in a cohort of middle-aged and older South Asians.    Method  Data were obtained from Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) study ( N = 906; mean age [standard deviation] = 55 [9.4] years, 46% women). TV viewing hours per week was assessed through questionnaire and classified into tertiles for analysis. Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the associations between TV viewing and measures of adiposity and body composition including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, pericardial fat volume, and visceral, subcutaneous, and inter-muscular fat area after adjusting for covariates including intentional exercise.    Results  Participants who were women, older, with lower education levels, and living longer in the United States watched TV for longer periods of times. Duration of TV viewing was positively associated with BMI ( p < 0.001), waist circumference ( p < 0.001), visceral fat area ( p = 0.001), and pericardial fat volume ( p = 0.003) independent of intentional exercise.    Conclusions  While studies in South Asians with a longitudinal design need to confirm our findings, our cross-sectional results indicate that reduction in TV viewing may be beneficial in reducing adiposity and maintaining a healthy body composition.

0.937208622,23915037,Copper-containing amine oxidases contribute to terminal polyamine oxidation in peroxisomes and apoplast of  Arabidopsis thaliana,"Background Polyamines (PAs) are oxidatively deaminated at their primary or secondary amino-groups by copper-containing amine oxidases (CuAOs) or FAD-dependent amine oxidases (PAOs), respectively. Both enzymes have long been considered to be apoplastic proteins. However, three out of five PAO isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana are localized in peroxisomes, while the other two PAOs are predicted to be cytosolic. Interestingly, most of these PAOs do not contribute to terminal PA oxidation, but instead are involved in the back-conversion pathway, producing spermidine from spermine and putrescine from spermidine, which in turn is inhibited by putrescine. This opens the question as to whether PAs are catabolized in the apoplast of Arabidopsis and if the terminal oxidation occurs in the peroxisomes. The main objective of this study was to know if these catabolic processes are mediated by CuAOs. Results A. thaliana contains ten genes annotated as CuAOs, but only one ( ATAO1 ) has been characterized at the protein level. Reported herein is the characterization of three genes encoding putative Arabidopsis CuAOs ( AtCuAO1 , AtCuAO2 and AtCuAO3 ). These genes encode functional CuAOs that use putrescine and spermidine as substrates. AtCuAO1, like ATAO1, is an extracellular protein, while AtCuAO2 and AtCuAO3 are localized in peroxisomes. The three genes present a different expression profile in response to exogenous treatments, such as application of abcisic acid, methyl jasmonate, salycilic acid, flagellin 22 and wounding. Conclusions PA catabolism in the Arabidopsis apoplast is mediated predominantly by CuAOs, while in peroxisomes the co-localization of CuAO-dependent terminal catabolism with PAO-back-conversion machineries might contribute to modulating putrescine-mediated inhibition of the back-conversion, suggesting the occurrence of a tight coordination between both catabolic pathways. The expression profile of AtCuAO1-3 in response to different exogenous treatments, together with the different localization of the corresponding proteins, provides evidence for the functional diversification of Arabidopsis CuAO proteins.",BMC plant biology,ANIMAL
0.830321945,17106453,Is urbanisation scrambling the genetic structure of human populations? A case study," Recent population expansion and increased migration linked to urbanisation are assumed to be eroding the genetic structure of human populations. We investigated change in population structure over three generations by analysing both demographic and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data from a random sample of 2351 men from twenty-two Iranian populations. Potential changes in genetic diversity ( Œ∏ ) and genetic distance ( F ST ) over the last three generations were analysed by assigning mtDNA sequences to populations based on the individual's place of birth or that of their mother or grandmother. Despite the fact that several areas included cities of over one million inhabitants, we detected no change in genetic diversity, and only a small decrease in population structure, except in the capital city (Tehran), which was characterised by massive immigration, increased Œ∏ and a large decrease in F ST over time. Our results suggest that recent erosion of human population structure might not be as important as previously thought, except in some large conurbations, and this clearly has important implications for future sampling strategies.

0.346110955,17638988,"Cow, Farm, and Management Factors During the Dry Period that Determine the Rate of Clinical Mastitis After Calving"," The purpose of the research was to investigate cow characteristics, farm facilities, and herd management strategies during the dry period to examine their joint influence on the rate of clinical mastitis after calving. Data were collected over a 2-yr period from 52 commercial dairy farms throughout England and Wales. Cows were separated for analysis into those housed for the dry period (8,710 cow-dry periods) and those at pasture (9,964 cow-dry periods). Multilevel models were used within a Bayesian framework with 2 response variables, the occurrence of a first case of clinical mastitis within the first 30 d of lactation and time to the first case of clinical mastitis during lactation. A variety of cow and herd management factors were identified as being associated with an increased rate of clinical mastitis and these were found to occur throughout the dry period. Significant cow factors were increased parity and at least one somatic cell count ‚â•200,000 cells/mL in the 90 d before drying off. A number of management factors related to hygiene were significantly associated with an increased rate of clinical mastitis. These included measures linked to the administration of dry-cow treatments and management of the early and late dry-period accommodation and calving areas. Other farm factors associated with a reduced rate of clinical mastitis were vaccination with a leptospirosis vaccine, selection of dry-cow treatments for individual cows within a herd rather than for the herd as a whole, routine body condition scoring of cows at drying off, and a pasture rotation policy of grazing dry cows for a maximum of 2 wk before allowing the pasture to remain nongrazed for a period of 4 wk. Models demonstrated a good ability to predict the farm incidence rate of clinical mastitis in a given year, with model predictions explaining over 85% of the variability in the observed data. The research indicates that specific dry-period management strategies have an important influence on the rate of clinical mastitis during the next lactation. ",Journal of dairy science,ANIMAL

Design 6‚ÄÖweek, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Setting 40 centres in the USA between 29 October 2009 and 1 July 2010. Primary and secondary outcome measures 547 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were enrolled and 418 entered the 2-week run-in period. Data from the run-in period were collected to test internal consistency, test‚Äìretest reliability, convergent validity and known-groups validity of the SOBDA. Three hundred and sixty six patients were randomised 2:2:1 to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50‚ÄÖ¬µg, salmeterol 50‚ÄÖ¬µg or placebo, twice daily. Results from the SOBDA questionnaire, Patient Global Assessment of Change Question, modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale (mMRC), Clinician Global Impression of Dysponea Severity (CGI-S), Clinician Global Impression of Change Question and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire self-administered standardised version (CRQ-SAS) were evaluated; spirometry and safety parameters were measured. Study endpoints were selected to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal validity of the SOBDA questionnaire in relation to the clinical criteria. Results Internal consistency of the SOBDA questionnaire (Cronbach Œ±) was 0.89. Test‚Äìretest reliability (intraclass correlation) was 0.94. The SOBDA weekly scores correlated with the patient-reported and clinician-reported mMRC, CGI-S and CRQ-SAS dyspnoea domain scores (0.29, 0.24, 0.24 and ‚Äì0.68, respectively). The SOBDA weekly scores differentiated between the responders and the non-responders as rated by the patients and the clinicians. Anchor-based and supportive distribution-based analyses produced a range of the potential values for the threshold for the responders and MID. Conclusions The 13-item SOBDA questionnaire is reliable, valid and responsive to change in patients with COPD.

We measured TP53R249S somatic mutation, hallmark of aflatoxin etiology in HCC, using droplet digital PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism. TP53R249S mutation was detected in 3 out of 41 HCC tumors from Hispanics in South Texas (7.3%). We also measured TP53R249S mutation in plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) from 218 HCC patients and 96 Hispanic subjects with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, from South Texas. The mutation was detected only in Hispanic and Asian HCC patients and patients harboring TP53R249S mutation were significantly younger and had a shorter overall survival. The mutation was not detected in any Hispanic subject with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Genes involved in cell cycle control of chromosomal replication and in BRCA1-dependent DNA damage response were enriched in HCCs with TP53R249S mutation. The E2F1 family members, E2F1 and E2F4, were identified as upstream regulators. TP53R249S mutation was detected in 5.7%‚Äì7.3% of Hispanics with HCC in South Texas. This mutation was associated with a younger age and worse prognosis. TP53R249S was however not detected in Hispanics in South Texas with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis. Aflatoxin exposure may contribute to a small number of HCCs in Hispanics in South Texas but the detection of TP53R249S mutation in plasma cfDNA is not a promising biomarker of risk assessment for HCC in subjects with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis in this population.

0.212967814,23968488,Detecting Association of Rare Variants by Testing an Optimally Weighted Combination of Variants for Quantitative Traits in General Families," Although next-generation sequencing technology allows sequencing the whole genome of large groups of individuals, the development of powerful statistical methods for rare variant association studies is still underway. Even though many statistical methods have been developed for mapping rare variants, most of these methods are for unrelated individuals only, whereas family data have been shown to improve power to detect rare variants. The majority of the existing methods for unrelated individuals are essentially testing the effect of a weighted combination of variants with different weighting schemes. The performance of these methods depends on the weights being used. Recently, Sha et al. [ Genet Epidemiol, 2012 ] proposed a test for Testing the effect of an Optimally Weighted combination of variants (TOW) for unrelated individuals. In this article, we extend our previously developed TOW for unrelated individuals to family-based data and propose a novel test for Testing the effect of an Optimally Weighted combination of variants for Family-based designs (TOW-F). The optimal weights are analytically derived. The results of extensive simulation studies show that TOW-F is robust to population stratification in a wide range of population structures, is robust to the direction and magnitude of the effects of causal variants, and is relatively robust to the percentage of neutral variants.

0.091477634,28412240,"The Level of Effort, Rather than Muscle Exercise Intensity Determines Strength Gain Following A Six-Week Training","  Aim  This study investigated the effect of voluntary motor effort during a low-intensity (30% maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]) muscle exercise training program on increasing muscle strength.    Materials and Methods  Eighteen young and healthy individuals were randomly assigned to one of three groups: high mental effort (HME), low mental effort (LME), or a no-training control (CTRL) group. Training lasted for 6 weeks (15 min/day, 5 days/week). The participants‚Äô right-elbow flexor muscle strength was measured before and after the training program.    Key findings  After training, the HME group gained 20.47 ¬± 8.33% (P = 0.01) strength while the LME and CTRL groups had negligible strength changes (1.89 ¬± 0.96% and ‚àí3.27 ¬± 2.61%, respectively; P > 0.05) despite muscle contraction intensity (30% MVC) sustained during training was the same for the HME and LME groups. These results suggest that the level of effort involved in resistance exercise training plays a critical role in determining the amount of strength augmentation.    Significance  The finding that high effort combined with low-level physical exercise training can significantly increase muscle strength has rehabilitation applications as many patients and frail older adults have difficulties in participating in high-intensity exercise training such as lifting heavy weights. High effort plus low-level muscle exercise might serve as a safe training regimen for effective muscle strengthening in vulnerable populations.    Graphical abstract   ",Life sciences,PHYSIO

The recombinant mcrA minus BL21 (DE3) host produces active McrA as evidenced by its acquired ability to selectively restrict the growth of T7 phage containing DNA methylated in vitro by HpaII methylase. The mcrA coding region contains several non-optimal E. coli triplets. Addition of the pACYC-RIL tRNA encoding plasmid to the BL21(DE3) host increased the yield of recombinant McrA (rMcrA) upon induction about 5- to 10-fold. McrA protein expressed at 37 ¬∞C is insoluble but a significant fraction is recovered as soluble protein after autoinduction at 20 ¬∞C. rMcrA protein, which is predicted to contain a Cys 4 -Zn 2+ finger and a catalytically important histidine triad in its putative nuclease domain, binds to several metal chelate resins without addition of a poly-histidine affinity tag. This feature was used to develop an efficient protocol for the rapid purification of nearly homogeneous rMcrA. The native protein is a dimer with a high Œ±-helical content as measured by circular dichroism analysis. Under all conditions tested purified rMcrA does not have measurable nuclease activity on HpaII methylated (Cm 5 CGG) DNA, although the purified protein does specifically bind HpaII methylated DNA.

In Italy, HPV vaccination is now offered free of charge to 12-year-old females. However, some regional health authorities have extended free vaccination to other age-groups, especially to girls under 18¬†years of age. We conducted a multicentre epidemiological study to ascertain the prevalence of different genotypes of HPV in young Italian women with normal cytology, with the aim of evaluating the possibility of extending vaccination to older females. Methods The study was performed in 2010. Women aged 16‚Äì26¬†years with normal cytology were studied. Cervical samples were analyzed to identify the presence of HPV by PCR amplification of a segment of ORF L1 (450¬†bp). All positive HPV-DNA samples underwent viral genotype analysis by means of a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Results Positivity for at least one HPV genotype was found in 18.2% of the 566 women recruited: 48.1% in the 16‚Äì17 age-class, 15.4 in the 18‚Äì20 age-class, 21.9% in the 21‚Äì23 age-class, and 15.5% in the 24‚Äì26 age-class; 10.1% of women were infected by at least one high-risk HPV genotype. HPV-16 was the most prevalent genotype. Only 4 (0.7%), 4 (0.7%) and 3 (0.5%) women were infected by HPV-18, HPV-6 and HPV-11, respectively. Of the HPV-DNA-positive women, 64.1% presented only one viral genotype, while 24.3% had multiple infections. The HPV genotypes most often involved in multiple infections were high-risk. A high prevalence was noted in the first years of sexual activity (48.1% of HPV-DNA-positive women aged 16‚Äì17¬†years); HPV prevalence subsequently declined and stabilized. The estimate of cumulative proportions of young women free from any HPV infection at each age was evaluated; 93.3% and 97.1% of 26¬†year-old women proved free from HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 and from HPV-6 and/or HPV-11, respectively. Conclusions Our findings confirm the crucial importance of conducting studies on women without cytological damage, in order to optimise and up-date preventive interventions against HPV infection, and suggest that vaccinating 26-year-old females at the time of their first pap-test is to be recommend, though this issue should be further explored.",BMC infectious diseases,IMMUN

In this study, we designed a screening strategy using DNA damage-induced mouse and human transcriptome data to identify novel downstream targets of p53. Our method selected genes with an induced expression in multiple organs of X-ray-irradiated p53 wild-type mice. The expression of inka box actin regulator 2 gene, known as Inka2 , was upregulated in 12 organs when p53 expression was induced. Similarly, INKA2 was induced in a p53-dependent manner at both the mRNA and protein level in human cells treated with adriamycin. Reporter assays confirmed that p53 directly regulated INKA2 through an intronic binding site. The overexpression of INKA2 produced a slight decrease in cancer cell growth in the colony formation assay. Moreover, the analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data revealed a decreased INKA2 expression in tumour samples carrying p53 mutations compared with p53 wild-type samples. In addition, significantly higher levels of DNA methylation were observed in the INKA2 promoter in tumour samples, concordant with the reduced INKA2 expression in tumour tissues. These results demonstrate the potential of INKA2 as a cancer cell growth inhibitor. Furthermore, INKA2 protein interacts with the serine/threonine-protein kinase, p21 (RAC1) activated kinase (PAK)4, which phosphorylates Œ≤-catenin to prevent ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. As Œ≤-catenin was downregulated in a stable INKA2 -expressing cell line, the findings of this study suggest that INKA2 is a novel, direct downstream target of p53 that potentially decreases cell growth by inhibiting the PAK4-Œ≤-catenin pathway.",International journal of oncology,ONCO

The ratio of sugars to acids is a determinant factor contributing to fruit liking, although different sugars and acids contribute in varying degrees to this complex trait. A segregating F 1 population of 95 individuals, previously characterized for several fruit quality characters, was used to map during 2‚Äâyears quantitative trait loci (QTL) for 50 primary metabolites, l -ascorbic acid (L-AA) and other related traits such as soluble solid content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), and pH. A total of 133 mQTL were detected above the established thresholds for 44 traits. Only 12.9% of QTL were detected in the 2‚Äâyears, suggesting a large environmental influence on primary metabolite content. An objective of this study was the identification of key metabolites that were associated to the overall variation in SSC and acidity. As it was observed in previous studies, a number of QTL controlling several metabolites and traits were co-located in homoeology group V (HG V). mQTL controlling a large variance in raffinose, sucrose, succinic acid, and L-AA were detected in approximate the same chromosomal regions of different homoeologous linkage groups belonging to HG V. Candidate genes for selected mQTL are proposed based on their co-localization, on the predicted function, and their differential gene expression among contrasting F 1 progeny lines. RNA-seq analysis from progeny lines contrasting in L-AA content detected 826 differentially expressed genes and identified Mannose-6-phosphate isomerase, FaM6PI1 , as a candidate gene contributing to natural variation in ascorbic acid in strawberry fruit. Selective breeding: The genetic basis of better strawberries Investigations have yielded early insights into the genetic basis of strawberry taste and nutrition. Such information informs efforts to selectively breed the fruit to maximize these qualities.

Only a small number of associations persisted over the 2‚Äâyears of investigations, suggesting that environmental factors also wield a significant influence over the strawberry fruit‚Äôs molecular makeup.

This paper proposes an accurate GPS‚Äìinertial measurement unit (IMU)/dead reckoning (DR) data fusion method based on a set of predictive models and occupancy grid constraints. First, we employ a set of autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) equations that have different structural parameters to build maximum likelihood models of raw navigation. Second, both grid constraints and spatial consensus checks on all predictive results and current measurements are required to have removal of outliers. Navigation data that satisfy stationary stochastic process are further fused to achieve accurate localization results. Third, the standard deviation of multimodal data fusion can be pre-specified by grid size. Finally, we perform a lot of field tests on a diversity of real urban scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that the method can significantly smooth small jumps in bias and considerably reduce accumulated position errors due to DR. With low computational complexity, the position accuracy of our method surpasses existing state-of-the-arts on the same dataset and the new data fusion method is practically applied in our driverless car.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",ENG
0.924977406,28489920,A national study of the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Australia 2005‚Äì2012,"Introduction Rates of new HIV-1 diagnoses are increasing in Australia, with evidence of an increasing proportion of non-B HIV-1 subtypes reflecting a growing impact of migration and travel. The present study aims to define HIV-1 subtype diversity patterns and investigate possible HIV-1 transmission networks within Australia. Methods The Australian Molecular Epidemiology Network (AMEN) HIV collaborating sites in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and western Sydney (New South Wales), provided baseline HIV-1 partial pol sequence, age and gender information for 4,873 patients who had genotypes performed during 2005‚Äì2012. HIV-1 phylogenetic analyses utilised MEGA V6, with a stringent classification of transmission pairs or clusters (bootstrap ‚â•98%, genetic distance ‚â§1.5% from at least one other sequence in the cluster). Results HIV-1 subtype B represented 74.5% of the 4,873 sequences (WA 59%, SA 68.4%, w-Syd 73.8%, Vic 75.6%, Qld 82.1%), with similar proportion of transmission pairs and clusters found in the B and non-B cohorts (23% vs 24.5% of sequences, p = 0.3). Significantly more subtype B clusters were comprised of ‚â•3 sequences compared with non-B clusters (45.0% vs 24.0%, p = 0.021) and significantly more subtype B pairs and clusters were male-only (88% compared to 53% CRF01_AE and 17% subtype C clusters). Factors associated with being in a cluster of any size included; being sequenced in a more recent time period (p<0.001), being younger ( p <0.001), being male ( p = 0.023) and having a B subtype ( p = 0.02). Being in a larger cluster (>3) was associated with being sequenced in a more recent time period ( p = 0.05) and being male ( p = 0.008). Conclusion This nationwide HIV-1 study of 4,873 patient sequences highlights the increased diversity of HIV-1 subtypes within the Australian epidemic, as well as differences in transmission networks associated with these HIV-1 subtypes. These findings provide epidemiological insights not readily available using standard surveillance methods and can inform the development of effective public health strategies in the current paradigm of HIV prevention in Australia.",PloS one,EPIDEM
0.707954211,29545810,Repertoire Analysis of Antibody CDR-H3 Loops Suggests Affinity Maturation Does Not Typically Result in Rigidification,"Antibodies can rapidly evolve in specific response to antigens. Affinity maturation drives this evolution through cycles of mutation and selection leading to enhanced antibody specificity and affinity. Elucidating the biophysical mechanisms that underlie affinity maturation is fundamental to understanding B-cell immunity. An emergent hypothesis is that affinity maturation reduces the conformational flexibility of the antibody‚Äôs antigen-binding paratope to minimize entropic losses incurred upon binding. In recent years, computational and experimental approaches have tested this hypothesis on a small number of antibodies, often observing a decrease in the flexibility of the complementarity determining region (CDR) loops that typically comprise the paratope and in particular the CDR-H3 loop, which contributes a plurality of antigen contacts. However, there were a few exceptions and previous studies were limited to a small handful of cases. Here, we determined the structural flexibility of the CDR-H3 loop for thousands of recent homology models of the human peripheral blood cell antibody repertoire using rigidity theory. We found no clear delineation in the flexibility of na√Øve and antigen-experienced antibodies. To account for possible sources of error, we additionally analyzed hundreds of human and mouse antibodies in the Protein Data Bank through both rigidity theory and B-factor analysis. By both metrics, we observed only a slight decrease in the CDR-H3 loop flexibility when comparing affinity matured antibodies to na√Øve antibodies, and the decrease was not as drastic as previously reported. Further analysis, incorporating molecular dynamics simulations, revealed a spectrum of changes in flexibility. Our results suggest that rigidification may be just one of many biophysical mechanisms for increasing affinity.",Frontiers in immunology,IMMUN
0.075759892,25540582,Effects of PEGylation on the physicochemical properties and in vivo distribution of organic nanotubes,"Application of organic nanotubes (ONTs) into drug nanocarriers ultimately requires validation in live animals. For improving the dispersibility in biological media and in vivo distribution, the outer surface of an ONT was functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) via the coassembly of an ONT-forming lipid with 5‚Äì20 mol% of a PEG-tethered lipid analogue (PEG-lipid). Firstly, the effect of PEGylation on the psysicochemical properties of ONTs, such as morphology and dispersibility, was investigated. PEGylation of ONTs slightly reduced the average length and effectively prevented the aggregation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The PEGylated ONTs even showed high thermal stability in aqueous dispersion at least up to 95¬∞C. Secondly, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction indicated that ~10 mol% of PEG-lipid was completely incorporated into the ONTs, while 20 mol% of PEG-lipid encountered a partial phase separation during coassembly. In the heating differential scanning calorimetry runs, the resultant PEGylated ONTs with 5 mol% PEG-lipid showed no sign of phase separation up to 180¬∞C under lyophilized condition, while those with 10 mol% and 20 mol% PEG-lipid showed some phase separation of the PEG-lipid above 120¬∞C. Finally, PEGylation significantly affected the tissue distribution and prolonged the persistence time in the blood in mice. Non-PEGylated ONTs was quickly cleared from the circulation after intravenous infusion and preferentially accumulated in the lung, while PEGylated ONTs was mainly trapped in the liver and could circulate in the blood up to 24 hours. This study provided valuable information of physicochemical properties and the in vivo distribution behavior of PEGylated ONTs for their potential application into drug nanocarriers.",International journal of nanomedicine,BIOCHEM

First, an array of large oligosaccharide oxazolines were synthesized and evaluated as substrates for the Endo-A catalyzed transglycosylation using ribonuclease B as a model system. The experimental results showed that Endo-A could tolerate modifications at the outer mannose residues of the Man 3 GlcNAc-oxazoline core, thus allowing introduction of large oligosaccharide ligands into a protein and meanwhile preserves the natural, core N -pentasaccharide (Man 3 GlcNAc 2 ) structure in the resulting glycoprotein upon transglycosylation. In addition to ligands for galectins and mannose-binding lectins, azido functionality could be readily introduced at the N -pentasaccharide (Man 3 GlcNAc 2 ) core using azido-containing Man 3 GlcNAc oxazoline as the donor substrate. The introduction of azido functionality permits further site-specific modifications of the resulting glycoproteins, as demonstrated by the successful attachment of two copies of Œ±Gal epitopes to ribonuclease B. This study reveals a broad substrate specificity of Endo-A for transglycosylation, and the chemoenzymatic method described here points to a new avenue for a quick access to various homogeneous N -glycoproteins for structure-activity relationship studies and for biomedical applications.

Methods The English version of LCADL was translated into Korean and back-translated into English. Subsequently, the back-translated version was reviewed and compared with the original, and thus the final K-LCADL was obtained. To evaluate the validation of the K-LCADL, patients simultaneously completed a pulmonary function test, a 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and questionnaires, including the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, the Korean version of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (K-SGRQ), the Korean version of the COPD Assessment Test (K-CAT), and the Korean version of the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (K-EQ-5D). To assess test-retest reliability, the K-LCADL was again administered to the same patients within 2 weeks from initial assessment. Results A total of 94 patients participated in the present study. The total K-LCADL score was positively correlated with the K-SGRQ (r=0.802, p<0.001), the mMRC dyspnea scale (r=0.603, p<0.001), and the K-CAT score (r=0.714, p<0.001), and negatively correlated with the K-EQ-5D (r=‚àí0.764, p<0.001), 6MWT (r=‚àí0.635, p<0.001), forced expiratory volume in one second 1 (r=‚àí0.416, p=0.002), and forced vital capacity (r=‚àí0.397, p=0.023).

0.943072152,27653375,Non-linear scaling of a musculoskeletal model of the lower limb using statistical shape models," Accurate muscle geometry for musculoskeletal models is important to enable accurate subject-specific simulations. Commonly, linear scaling is used to obtain individualised muscle geometry. More advanced methods include non-linear scaling using segmented bone surfaces and manual or semi-automatic digitisation of muscle paths from medical images. In this study, a new scaling method combining non-linear scaling with reconstructions of bone surfaces using statistical shape modelling is presented. Statistical Shape Models (SSMs) of femur and tibia/fibula were used to reconstruct bone surfaces of nine subjects. Reference models were created by morphing manually digitised muscle paths to mean shapes of the SSMs using non-linear transformations and inter-subject variability was calculated. Subject-specific models of muscle attachment and via points were created from three reference models. The accuracy was evaluated by calculating the differences between the scaled and manually digitised models. The points defining the muscle paths showed large inter-subject variability at the thigh and shank ‚Äì up to 26 mm; this was found to limit the accuracy of all studied scaling methods. Errors for the subject-specific muscle point reconstructions of the thigh could be decreased by 9% to 20% by using the non-linear scaling compared to a typical linear scaling method. We conclude that the proposed non-linear scaling method is more accurate than linear scaling methods. Thus, when combined with the ability to reconstruct bone surfaces from incomplete or scattered geometry data using statistical shape models our proposed method is an alternative to linear scaling methods.

0.368399544,23145530,Cell population-specific expression analysis of human cerebellum,"Background Interpreting gene expression profiles obtained from heterogeneous samples can be difficult because bulk gene expression measures are not resolved to individual cell populations. We have recently devised Population-Specific Expression Analysis (PSEA), a statistical method that identifies individual cell types expressing genes of interest and achieves quantitative estimates of cell type-specific expression levels. This procedure makes use of marker gene expression and circumvents the need for additional experimental information like tissue composition. Results To systematically assess the performance of statistical deconvolution, we applied PSEA to gene expression profiles from cerebellum tissue samples and compared with parallel, experimental separation methods. Owing to the particular histological organization of the cerebellum, we could obtain cellular expression data from in situ hybridization and laser-capture microdissection experiments and successfully validated computational predictions made with PSEA. Upon statistical deconvolution of whole tissue samples, we identified a set of transcripts showing age-related expression changes in the astrocyte population. Conclusions PSEA can predict cell-type specific expression levels from tissues homogenates on a genome-wide scale. It thus represents a computational alternative to experimental separation methods and allowed us to identify age-related expression changes in the astrocytes of the cerebellum. These molecular changes might underlie important physiological modifications previously observed in the aging brain.",BMC genomics,BIOCHEM
0.731614335,16407198,THE STRUCTURE OF  LEISHMANIA MEXICANA  ICP PROVIDES EVIDENCE FOR CONVERGENT EVOLUTION OF CYSTEINE PEPTIDASE INHIBITORS *," Clan CA, family C1 cysteine peptidases (CPs) are important virulence factors and drug targets in parasites that cause neglected diseases. Natural CP inhibitors of the I42 family, known as ICP, occur in some protozoa and bacterial pathogens, but are absent from metazoa. They are active against both parasite and mammalian CPs, despite having no sequence similarity with other classes of CP inhibitor. Recent data suggest that L. mexicana ICP plays an important role in host-parasite interactions. We have now solved the structure of ICP from L. mexicana by NMR and shown that it adopts a type of immunoglobulin-like fold not previously reported in lower eukaryotes or bacteria. The structure places three loops containing highly conserved residues at one end of the molecule, one loop being highly mobile. Interaction studies with CPs confirm the importance of these loops for the interaction between ICP and CPs and suggest the mechanism of inhibition. Structure-guided mutagenesis of ICP has revealed that residues in the mobile loop are critical for CP inhibition. Data-driven docking models support the importance of the loops in the ICP-CP interaction. This study provides structural evidence for the convergent evolution from an immunoglobulin fold of CP inhibitors with a cystatin-like mechanism. ",The Journal of biological chemistry,BIOCHEM
0.18221352,20141240,Attentional Modulation of the P50 Suppression Deficit in Recent-Onset and Chronic Schizophrenia," Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in P50 suppression to the second stimulus in a pair, a process often conceptualized as a preattentive index of sensory gating. This study assessed malleability of the deficit by determining whether early attentional control can influence P50 gating across different phases of schizophrenia. Participants included 28 patients in the recent-onset ( n =16) or chronic ( n =12) phase of illness, and 28 healthy comparison subjects. During the standard paradigm, chronic schizophrenia patients exhibited impaired P50 suppression relative to healthy subjects, while recent-onset schizophrenia patients were intermediate. Directing voluntary attention toward the initial stimulus yielded substantial improvements in the P50 ratio; recent-onset schizophrenia patients achieved ratio scores comparable to those of healthy participants while chronic patients also improved and could no longer be distinguished clearly from the healthy comparison sample. Directing attention toward the second stimulus enhanced P50 amplitude to the second stimulus across groups, possibly because activation of the inhibitory mechanism was overridden or circumvented by task demands. Thus, P50 suppression may be primarily preattentive under standard conditions but manipulation of early attention can exert a modulatory influence on P50, indicating that the suppression deficit is malleable in schizophrenia without pharmacological agents.

We aimed to examine the prognostic value of indices of MSIMI and exercise stress-induced myocardial ischemia (ESIMI) in a population of ischemic heart disease patients that was not confined by having a recent positive physical stress test.    Methods and results:  The Responses of Mental Stress Induced Myocardial Ischemia to Escitalopram Treatment (REMIT) study enrolled 310 subjects who underwent mental and exercise stress testing and were followed annually for a median of four years. Study endpoints included time to first and total rate of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as all-cause mortality and hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes. Cox and negative binomial regression adjusting for age, sex, resting left ventricular ejection fraction, and heart failure status were used to examine associations of indices of MSIMI and ESIMI with study endpoints. The continuous variable of mental stress-induced left ventricular ejection fraction change was significantly associated with both endpoints (all p values < 0.05). For every reduction of 5% in left ventricular ejection fraction induced by mental stress, patients had a 5% increase in the probability of a major adverse cardiovascular event at the median follow-up time and a 20% increase in the number of major adverse cardio vascular events endured over the follow-up period of six years. Indices of ESIMI did not predict endpoints ( ps > 0.05).

Initially, 3324 individuals were randomly sampled from the baseline database. In the end, 2441 successful cases were obtained for the telephone survey. After excluding cases with missing SES or HRQOL information and the cases whose questionnaires were answered by their family members, 2347 individuals were included in the final analysis.

0.534998639,29228556,Riemerella anatipestifer M949_0459  gene is responsible for the bacterial resistance to tigecycline,"Based on its important role in last-line therapeutics against multidrug-resistant bacteria, tigecycline has been increasingly important in treating infections. However, mounting reports on tigecycline-resistant bacterial strains isolated from different sources are of concern, and molecular mechanisms regarding tigecycline resistance are poorly understood. Riemerella anatipestifer is a Gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, which causes fibrinous pericarditis, perihepatitis, and meningitis in infected ducks. We previously constructed a random transposon mutant library using Riemerella anatipestifer strain CH3, in present study, we described that Riemerella anatipestifer M949_0459 gene is responsible for the bacterial resistance to tigecycline. Using the minimum inhibitory concentration assay, a mutant strain showed significantly increased (about six-fold) tigecycline susceptibility. Subsequently, the knocked-down gene was identified as M949_0459 , a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent oxidoreductase. To confirm the resistance function, M949_0459 gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21, and the minimum inhibitory concentration analysis showed that the gene product conferred resistance to tigecycline. Additionally, expression of the M949_0459 gene under treatment with tigecycline was measured with quantitative real-time PCR. Results showed that the mRNA expression of M949_0459 gene was elevated under tigecycline treatment with dose range of 1-10 mg/L, and peaked at 4 mg/L. Moreover, two kinds of efflux pump inhibitors, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone and phenylalanine arginyl Œ≤ -naphthylamide were tested, which showed no function on tigecycline resistance in the strain CH3.

0.899325505,22440072,Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Improves Emotional Reactivity to Social Stress: Results from A Randomized Controlled Trial,"  Objectives  The high likelihood of recurrences in depression is linked to progressive increase in emotional reactivity to stress (stress sensitization). Mindfulness-based therapies teach mindfulness skills designed to decrease emotional reactivity in the face of negative-affect producing stressors. The primary aim of the current study was to assess whether Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is efficacious in reducing emotional reactivity to social evaluative threat in a clinical sample with recurrent depression. A secondary aim was to assess whether improvement in emotional reactivity mediates improvements in depressive symptoms.    Methods  Fifty-two individuals with partially-remitted depression were randomized into an 8-week MBCT course or a waitlist control condition. All participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) before and after the 8-week trial period. Emotional reactivity to stress was assessed with the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory at several time points before, during and after the stressor.    Results  MBCT was associated with decreased emotional reactivity to social stress, specifically during the recovery (post-stressor) phase of the TSST. Waitlist controls showed an increase in anticipatory (pre-stressor) anxiety, which was absent in the MBCT group. Improvements in emotional reactivity partially mediated improvements in depressive symptoms.    Limitations  Limitations include small sample size, lack of objective or treatment adherence measures, and non-generalizability to more severely depressed populations.    Conclusions  Given that emotional reactivity to stress is an important psychopathological process underlying the chronic and recurrent nature of depression, these findings suggest that mindfulness skills are important in adaptive emotion regulation when coping with stress.

0.210033647,27765481,Cost Analysis of the HEART Pathway Randomized Control Trial,"  Introduction  The HEART Pathway is a diagnostic protocol designed to identify low-risk patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with chest pain that are safe for early discharge. This protocol has been shown to significantly decrease healthcare resource utilization compared to usual care. However, the impact of the HEART Pathway on the cost of care has yet to be reported.    Methods and Results  We performed a cost analysis of patients enrolled in the HEART Pathway trial, which randomized participants to either usual care or the HEART Pathway protocol. For low-risk patients, the HEART Pathway recommended early discharge from the ED without further testing. We compared index visit cost, cost at 30 days, and cardiac-related healthcare cost at 30 days between the two treatment arms. Costs for each patient included facility and professional costs. Cost at 30 days included total inpatient and outpatient costs, including the index encounter, regardless of etiology. Cardiac-related healthcare cost at 30 days included the index encounter and costs adjudicated to be cardiac-related within that period.  270 of the 282 patients enrolled in the trial had cost data available for analysis. There was a significant reduction in cost for the HEART Pathway group at 30 days (median cost savings of $216 per individual), which was most evident in low-risk (TIMI score of 0‚Äì1) patients (median savings of $253 per patient) and driven primarily by lower cardiac diagnostic costs in the HEART Pathway group.

0.865315226,22639979,Temporal analysis of vascular smooth muscle cell elasticity and adhesion reveals oscillation waveforms that differ with aging," A spectral analysis approach was developed for detailed study of time-resolved, dynamic changes in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) elasticity and adhesion to identify differences in VSMC from young and aged monkeys. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure Young's modulus of elasticity and adhesion as assessed by fibronectin (FN) or anti-beta 1 integrin interaction with the VSMC surface. Measurements demonstrated that VSMC cells from old versus young monkeys had elevated elasticity (21.6 kPa vs 3.5 kPa or a 612% elevation in elastic modulus) and adhesion (86 pN vs 43 pN or a 200% increase in unbinding force). Spectral analysis identified three major frequency components in the temporal oscillation patterns for elasticity (ranging from 1.7√ó10 -3 to 1.9√ó10 -2 Hz in old and 8.4√ó10 -4 to 1.5√ó10 -2 in young) and showed that the amplitude of oscillation was larger (p<0.05) in old than in young at all frequencies. It was also observed that patterns of oscillation in the adhesion data were similar to the elasticity waveforms. Cell stiffness was reduced and the oscillations were inhibited by treatment with cytochalasin D, ML7 or blebbistatin indicating involvement of actin-myosin driven processes. In conclusion, these data demonstrate the efficacy of time-resolved analysis of AFM cell elasticity and adhesion measurements and that it provides a uniquely sensitive method to detect real-time functional differences in biomechanical and adhesive properties of cells. The oscillatory behavior suggests mechanisms governing elasticity and adhesion are coupled and affected differentially during aging which may link these events to changes in vascular stiffness.

0.60282857,16244649,Eye-specific suppression in human LGN reflects perceptual dominance during binocular rivalry," When dissimilar images are presented to the two eyes, they compete for perceptual dominance so that each image is visible in turn for a few seconds while the other is suppressed. Such binocular rivalry is associated with relative suppression of local, eye-based representations 1 ‚Äì 4 , that are also modulated by high-level influences such as perceptual grouping 3 , 5 . But currently it is unclear how early in visual processing the suppression of eye-based signals can occur. Here, we used high spatial resolution fMRI in conjunction with a novel binocular rivalry stimulus to show that signals recorded from the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit eye-specific suppression during rivalry. Regions of LGN that showed strong eye-preference independently showed strongly reduced activity during binocular rivalry, when the stimulus presented in their preferred eye was perceptually suppressed. The human LGN is thus the earliest stage of visual processing that reflects eye-specific dominance and suppression. ",Nature,NEURO
0.454971456,23531789,Neuroendocrine regulation of gonadotropin secretion in seasonally breeding birds,"Seasonally breeding birds detect environmental signals, such as light, temperature, food availability, and presence of mates to time reproduction. Hypothalamic neurons integrate external and internal signals, and regulate reproduction by releasing neurohormones to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland synthesizes and releases gonadotropins which in turn act on the gonads to stimulate gametogenesis and sex steroid secretion. Accordingly, how gonadotropin secretion is controlled by the hypothalamus is key to our understanding of the mechanisms of seasonal reproduction. A hypothalamic neuropeptide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), activates reproduction by stimulating gonadotropin synthesis and release. Another hypothalamic neuropeptide, gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), inhibits gonadotropin synthesis and release directly by acting on the pituitary gland or indirectly by decreasing the activity of GnRH neurons. Therefore, the next step to understand seasonal reproduction is to investigate how the activities of GnRH and GnIH neurons in the hypothalamus and their receptors in the pituitary gland are regulated by external and internal signals. It is possible that locally-produced triiodothyronine resulting from the action of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase on thyroxine stimulates the release of gonadotropins, perhaps by action on GnRH neurons. The function of GnRH neurons is also regulated by transcription of the GnRH gene. Melatonin, a nocturnal hormone, stimulates the synthesis and release of GnIH and GnIH may therefore regulate a daily rhythm of gonadotropin secretion.

0.943207931,21709207,Activation of PPARŒ¥ Enhances Regenerative Capacity of Human Endothelial Progenitor Cells by Stimulating Biosynthesis of BH4," The mechanisms underlying the regenerative capacity of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are not fully understood. We hypothesized that biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an important mechanism responsible for the stimulatory effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARŒ¥) activation on regenerative function of human EPCs. Treatment of human EPCs with a selective PPARŒ¥ agonist GW501516 for 24 h increased the levels of mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH I), as well as the production of BH4. The effects of GW501516 were mediated by suppression of PTEN expression thereby increasing phosphorylation of AKT. The AKT signaling also mediated GW501516-induced phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In addition, activation of PPARŒ¥ significantly enhanced proliferation of EPCs. This effect was abolished by the GTPCH I inhibitor, DAHP, or genetic inactivation of GTPCH I with small interfering RNA (siRNA), but not by inhibition of eNOS with L-NAME. Supplementation of NO did not reverse DAHP-inhibited BrdU incorporation. Furthermore, transplantation of human EPCs stimulated re-endothelialization in a mouse model of carotid artery injury. Pretreatment of EPCs with GW501516 significantly enhanced ability of transplanted EPCs to repair denuded endothelium. GTPCH I-siRNA transfection significantly inhibited in vivo regenerative capacity of EPCs stimulated with GW501516. Thus, in human EPCs, activation of PPARŒ¥ stimulates expression and activity of GTPCH I and biosynthesis of BH4 via PTEN-AKT signaling pathway. This effect enhances the regenerative function of EPCs.

Methods  Clinical and imaging data from patients with GCA (including subjects diagnosed by LV imaging) enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study and/or a randomized clinical trial were included. New arterial lesions were defined as a lesion in a previously unaffected artery.    Results  The study included 187 patients with GCA, 146 (78%) female, mean (¬±SD) age at diagnosis 68.5 ¬± 8.5 years; 39% diagnosed by LV imaging. At least one arterial lesion was present in 123 (66%) on the first study. The most frequently affected arteries were subclavian (42%), axillary (32%), and thoracic aorta (20%). In 106 patients (57%) with serial imaging, new arterial lesions were noted in 41 patients (39%), all of whom had a baseline abnormality, over a mean (¬±SD) follow-up of 4.39 (2.22) years. New abnormalities were observed in 33% patients by year 2; clinical features of active disease were present at only 50% of these cases. There were no differences in age, sex, temporal artery biopsy positivity, or disease activity in patients with or without new lesions.    Conclusions  In this cohort of patients with GCA, LV abnormalities on first imaging were common. Development of new arterial lesions occurred in patients with arterial abnormalities at first imaging, often in the absence of symptoms of active disease. Arterial imaging should be considered in all patients with GCA at diagnosis and serial imaging at least in patients with baseline abnormalities.  ",Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,CLINIC
0.303089808,16723742,A novel role for microtubules in apoptotic chromatin dynamics and cellular fragmentation," Summary  Dramatic changes in cellular dynamics characterise the apoptotic execution phase, culminating in fragmentation into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies. Previous evidence suggests that actin-myosin plays dominant roles in apoptotic cellular remodelling, while all other cytoskeletal elements dismantle. We have used fixed and live-cell imaging to confirm that interphase microtubules rapidly depolymerise at the start of the execution phase. At around this time, pericentriolar components (pericentrin, ninein and Œ≥-tubulin) are lost from the centrosomal region. Subsequently, however, extensive non-centrosomal bundles of densely packed, dynamic microtubules rapidly assemble throughout the cytoplasm in all cell-lines tested. These microtubules play important roles in the peripheral relocation of chromatin in the dying cell, because nocodazole treatment restricts the dispersal of condensed apoptotic chromatin into surface blebs, and causes the withdrawal of chromatin fragments back towards the cell centre. Importantly, nocodazole and taxol are both potent inhibitors of apoptotic fragmentation in A431 cells, implicating dynamic microtubules in apoptotic body formation. Live-cell imaging studies indicate that fragmentation is accompanied by the extension of rigid microtubule-rich spikes that project through the cortex of the dying cell. These structures enhance interactions between apoptotic cells and phagocytes in vitro, by providing additional sites for attachment to neighbouring cells. ",Journal of cell science,BIOCHEM

Materials and Methods: Male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into six groups of 8 animals of each, including control, toxic (CCl 4 ), R. canina 250, 500, and 750 mg/kg + CCl 4 and R. canina 750 mg/kg alone. R. canina (p.o., daily) and CCl 4 (1 ml/kg twice a week, 50% v/v in olive oil, i.p.) were administered to animals for six weeks. Serum analysis was performed to assay the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine amino transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin (ALB), total protein (TP) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Biochemical observations were also supplemented with histopathological examination (haematoxylin and eosin staining) of liver section. Results: Hepatotoxicity was evidenced by considerable increase in serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and lipid peroxidation (MDA) and decrease in levels of ALB and TP. Injection of CCL4 also induced congestion in central vein, and lymphocyte inÔ¨Åltration. Treatment with hydro-alcoholic fruit extract of R. canina at doses of 500 and 750 mg/kg significantly reduced CCl 4 -elevated levels of ALT, AST, ALP and MDA (p<0.01). The extract also increased the serum levels of ALB and TP compared to CCl 4 group (p<0.01) at the indicated dose Histopathological studies supported the biochemical finding. Conclusion: Our finding indicated hepatoprotective effects of the hydro-alcoholic fruit extract of R. canina on CCl 4 -induced hepatic damage in rats and suggested that these effects may be produced through reducing oxidative stress.",Avicenna journal of phytomedicine,BIOCHEM
0.136152956,19098894,Induced pluripotent stem cells from a spinal muscular atrophy patient," Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common inherited forms of neurological disease leading to infant mortality. Patients exhibit selective loss of lower motor neurons resulting in muscle weakness, paralysis, and often death. Although patient fibroblasts have been used extensively to study SMA, motor neurons have a unique anatomy and physiology which may underlie their vulnerability to the disease process. Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from skin fibroblast samples taken from a child with SMA. These cells expanded robustly in culture, maintained the disease genotype, and generated motor neurons that showed selective deficits compared to those derived from the child's unaffected mother. This is the first study to show human iPS cells can be used to model the specific pathology seen in a genetically inherited disease. As such, it represents a promising resource to study disease mechanisms, screen novel drug compounds, and develop new therapies. ",Nature,BIOCHEM

Interviews covered abuse experiences, cognitive and emotional consequences of abuse, coping strategies, and sexual behavior and relationships. Overall, these young women had complex abuse histories, often experiencing more than one type of abuse in the context of other difficult life events. Avoidance and substance use were frequently utilized as coping strategies for abuse-related distress. Young women reported sexual and relationship concerns, including avoidance of sex, sexual dysfunction, sex as a trigger for abuse memories, and difficulty establishing intimacy and trust. Relationships between abuse-related reactions and sexual risk behavior, as well as recommendations for interventions, are discussed. ",Qualitative health research,CLINIC

0.195761864,29398765,Increased Educational Attainment among U.S. Mothers and their Children‚Äôs Academic Expectations," Existing research provides strong evidence that children with more educated parents have higher academic expectations for themselves, but has yet to consider how an increase in the education of lower educated mothers might alter the expectations of their children. In light of the historic increase in U.S. mothers‚Äô pursuit of additional education, this study investigates this timely question using data from a nationally representative, intergenerational sample of U.S. children and mothers participating in the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth ( n mothers = 3,265; n children = 8,027). Combining random and fixed effects procedures, the findings revealed that that an increase in mothers‚Äô educational attainment is linked to an increase in their children‚Äôs expectations to earn a Bachelor‚Äôs degree. Increased maternal education did not, however, buffer against the risk that children will downgrade these expectations upon approaching the end of high school. These results have theoretical importance to traditional models of status attainment, which typically view parental education as a stable feature of family background; extend a small but burgeoning literature that explores whether and why increased maternal education improves the mobility prospects of their children; and speak to current two-generation policy approaches that aim to leverage trends in mothers education to reduce inequality for future generations.

0.015192988,25358327,The Influence of Feed Energy Density and a Formulated Additive on Rumen and Rectal Temperature in Hanwoo Steers,"The present study investigated the optimum blending condition of protected fat, choline and yeast culture for lowering of rumen temperature. The Box Benken experimental design, a fractional factorial arrangement, and response surface methodology were employed. The optimum blending condition was determined using the rumen simulated in vitro fermentation. An additive formulated on the optimum condition contained 50% of protected fat, 25% of yeast culture, 5% of choline, 7% of organic zinc, 6.5% of cinnamon, and 6.5% of stevioside. The feed additive was supplemented at a rate of 0.1% of diet (orchard grass:concentrate, 3:7) and compared with a control which had no additive. The treatment resulted in lower volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration and biogas than the control. To investigate the effect of the optimized additive and feed energy levels on rumen and rectal temperatures, four rumen cannulated Hanwoo (Korean native beef breed) steers were in a 4√ó4 Latin square design. Energy levels were varied to low and high by altering the ratio of forage to concentrate in diet: low energy (6:4) and high energy (4:6). The additive was added at a rate of 0.1% of the diet. The following parameters were measured; feed intake, rumen and rectal temperatures, ruminal pH and VFA concentration. This study was conducted in an environmentally controlled house with temperature set at 30¬∞C and relative humidity levels of 70%. Steers were housed individually in raised crates to facilitate collection of urine and feces. The adaptation period was for 14 days, 2 days for sampling and 7 days for resting the animals. The additive significantly reduced both rumen (p<0.01) and rectal temperatures (p<0.001) without depressed feed intake. There were interactions (p<0.01) between energy level and additive on ruminal temperature. Neither additive nor energy level had an effect on total VFA concentration. The additive however, significantly increased (p<0.01) propionate and subsequently had lower acetate:propionate (A/P) ratios than non-additive supplementation. High concentrate diets had significantly lower pH. Interactions between energy and additive were observed (p<0.01) in ammonia nitrogen production. Supplementation of diets with the additive resulted in lower rumen and rectal temperatures, hence the additive showed promise in alleviating undesirable effects of heat stress in cattle.",Asian-Australasian journal of animal sciences,ANIMAL

Design  We analysed data from the second British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal 2000)‚Äìa stratified national probability sample survey conducted between 1999‚Äì2001. Data from Natsal's main and ethnic minority boost (EMB) samples were analysed. Multivariate analysis was performed using complex survey functions to account for the clustered, stratified, and differential selection probabilities inherent within the survey.    Results  A total of 385 (216 women and 169 men) black African respondents were included in the study. 44.0% women and 36.4% men reported ever having had an HIV test. In univariate analysis, HIV testing was associated with being born abroad (OR 3.63), having a new partner(s) from abroad in past 5 years (OR 2.88), and attending a GUM clinic (OR 3.27) among men; and educational attainment (OR 3.50), perception of ‚Äúnot very much‚Äù personal risk of HIV (OR 2.75), and attending a GUM clinic (OR 2.91) among women. After adjusting for potential confounders, an increased likelihood of HIV testing was associated with being in the United Kingdom less than 5 years relative to being UK born (adjusted OR 9.49), and ever attending a GUM clinic (adj OR 5.53), for men; and educational attainment (adj OR 4.13), and low perception of HIV risk (adj OR 2.77) for women.    Conclusions  Black Africans appear to have relatively high rates of HIV testing reflecting, at least partially, awareness of risk behaviours and potential exposure to HIV. Nevertheless, there remains substantial potential for health gain and innovative approaches are required to further increase timely HIV testing.  ",Sexually transmitted infections,EPIDEM

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 is the most prevalent worldwide. Subtype 1a, compared with 1b, shows lower response rates and higher propensity to select for drug resistance to NS3 and selected NS5A and nonnucleoside NS5B inhibitors. Two distinct clades of subtype 1a have been described. Methods. Using Bayesian methodology, we performed a time-scaled phylogeny reconstruction of clade separation and characterized the geographic distribution, phylodynamics, and association with natural resistance variants of NS3 sequences from 362 patients carrying subtype 1a HCV. Results. All sequences segregated in 2 clearly distinct clades. Clade I showed an earlier origin from the common ancestor compared with clade II. Clade I virus was more prevalent in non-European countries, represented mostly by United States, compared with European (75.7% vs 49.3%; P < .001). The prevalence of the natural NS3 variant Q80K, associated with resistance to the macrocyclic protease inhibitor simeprevir, was detected in 51.6% of clade I and 0% of clade II ( P < .001); clade I showed a lower genetic barrier for Q80K, whereas no sign of selective pressure at any protease inhibitor resistance-associated codon was detected. Conclusions. Hepatitis C virus subtype 1a clades have a clearly different distribution in Europe and the United States, and the natural resistance mutation Q80K is exclusively associated with clade I.",Open forum infectious diseases,IMMUN

It was hypothesised that lymphangiogenesis is involved in the pathophysiology of HP via cell transport. Objective To determine the clinical significance of lymphangiogenic factors in HP. Methods Levels of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and CCL21 in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured in 29 healthy volunteers, 14 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 26 patients with HP by ELISA. Additionally, immunohistochemical analyses were performed using lung specimens of patients with HP (n=8) and IPF (n=10). Results BALF VEGF-D levels were significantly elevated in patients with HP compared to the other groups. BALF VEGF‚ÄìD levels in patients with HP correlated significantly with the BALF total cell and lymphocyte counts (r=0.485, p=0.014 and r=0.717, p<0.0001, respectively). BALF VEGF-C and CCL21 levels were increased in patients with HP compared to healthy volunteers, but not patients with IPF. BALF CCL21 levels were negatively correlated with the forced expiratory volume in 1‚ÄÖs percentage and diffuse capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (r=‚àí0.662, p=0.007 and r=‚àí0.671, p=0.024, respectively). According to the immunohistochemical analyses, CCL21 was expressed in the lymphatic endothelium in both conditions and CCR7 + cells were aggregated around lymphatics in patients with HP, but not in patients with IPF.

While a subset of elderly individuals can still mount sufficient vaccine-induced antibody responses, little is known about the properties of the vaccine-induced antibody repertoires in elderly as compared to young responders. To gain insights into the effects of aging on influenza vaccine-induced antibody responses, we used flow cytometry and a cell-barcoding method to sequence antibody heavy and light chain gene pairs expressed by individual blood plasmablasts generated in response to influenza vaccination in elderly (aged 70 ‚Äì 89) and young (aged 20 ‚Äì 29) responders. We found similar blood plasmablast levels in the elderly and young responders seven days post vaccination. Informatics analysis revealed increased clonality, but similar heavy chain V(D)J gene usage in the elderly as compared to young vaccine responders. Although the elderly responders exhibited decreased antibody sequence diversity and fewer consequential mutations relative to young responders, recombinant antibodies from elderly responders bound a broader range of influenza strain HAs. Thus elderly influenza vaccine responders mount plasmablast responses with restricted diversity but with an increased breadth of binding across influenza strains. Our results suggest that the ability to generate plasmablast responses encoding cross-strain binding antibodies likely represents a mechanism important to vaccine responses in the elderly.

0.989870526,29996093,A Hepatocyte FOXN3-Œ± Cell Glucagon Axis Regulates Fasting Glucose,"  SUMMARY  The common genetic variation at rs8004664 in the FOXN3 gene is independently and significantly associated with fasting blood glucose, but not insulin, in non-diabetic humans. Recently, we reported that primary hepatocytes from rs8004664 hyperglycemia risk allele carriers have increased FOXN3 transcript and protein levels and liver-limited overexpression of human FOXN3, a transcriptional repressor that had not been implicated in metabolic regulation previously, increases fasting blood glucose in zebrafish. Here, we find that injection of glucagon into mice and adult zebrafish decreases liver Foxn3 protein and transcript levels. Zebrafish foxn3 loss-of-function mutants have decreased fasting blood glucose, blood glucagon, liver gluconeogenic gene expression, and Œ± cell mass. Conversely, liver-limited overexpression of foxn3 increases Œ± cell mass. Supporting these genetic findings in model organisms, non-diabetic rs8004664 risk allele carriers have decreased suppression of glucagon during oral glucose tolerance testing. By reciprocally regulating each other, liver FOXN3 and glucagon control fasting glucose.    In Brief  Karanth et al. find that glucagon lowers liver expression of Foxn3. Deletion of the Foxn3 gene decreases fasting blood glucose and the number of glucagon-producing Œ± cells in the primary islet of zebrafish. Human carriers of the hyperglycemia risk allele of FOXN3 gene fail to suppress glucagon during oral glucose challenge.    Graphical Abstract    ",Cell reports,BIOCHEM
0.077523274,27957537,Implantable microcoils for intracortical magnetic stimulation,"Magnetic stimulation from cortically implantable microcoils can activate neuronal circuits with high selectivity and reliability. Neural prostheses that stimulate the neocortex have the potential to treat a wide range of neurological disorders. However, the efficacy of electrode-based implants remains limited, with persistent challenges that include an inability to create precise patterns of neural activity as well as difficulties in maintaining response consistency over time. These problems arise from fundamental limitations of electrodes as well as their susceptibility to implantation and have proven difficult to overcome. Magnetic stimulation can address many of these limitations, but coils small enough to be implanted into the cortex were not thought strong enough to activate neurons. We describe a new microcoil design and demonstrate its effectiveness for both activating cortical neurons and driving behavioral responses. The stimulation of cortical pyramidal neurons in brain slices in vitro was reliable and could be confined to spatially narrow regions (<60 Œºm). The spatially asymmetric fields arising from the coil helped to avoid the simultaneous activation of passing axons. In vivo implantation was safe and resulted in consistent and predictable behavioral responses. The high permeability of magnetic fields to biological substances may yield another important advantage because it suggests that encapsulation and other adverse effects of implantation will not diminish coil performance over time, as happens to electrodes. These findings suggest that a coil-based implant might be a useful alternative to existing electrode-based devices. The enhanced selectivity of microcoil-based magnetic stimulation will be especially useful for visual prostheses as well as for many brain-computer interface applications that require precise activation of the cortex.",Science advances,ENG
0.830358631,22901340,Directed evolution reveals requisite sequence elements in the functional expression of P450 2F1 in  E. coli," Cytochrome P450 2F1 (P450 2F1) is expressed exclusively in the human respiratory tract and is implicated in 3-methylindole (3MI)-induced pneumotoxicity via dehydrogenation of 3MI to a reactive electrophilic intermediate, 3-methyleneindolenine (3-MEI). Studies of P450 2F1 to date have been limited by the failure to express this enzyme in Escherichia coli . By contrast, P450 2F3, a caprine homologue that shares 84 % sequence identity with P450 2F1 (86 amino acid differences), has been expressed in E. coli at yields greater than 250 nmol/L culture. We hypothesized that a limited number of sequence differences between P450s 2F1 and 2F3 could limit P450 2F1 expression in E. coli , and that problematic P450 2F1 sequence elements could be identified by directed evolution. A library of P450 2F1/2F3 mutants was created by DNA family shuffling and screened for expression in E. coli . Three generations of DNA shuffling revealed a mutant (named JH_2F_F3_1_007) with 96.5 % nucleotide sequence identity to P450 2F1 and which expressed 119 ¬± 40 pmol (n = 3, mean ¬± SD) hemoprotein in 1 mL microaerobic cultures. Across all three generations, two regions were observed where P450 2F3-derived sequence was consistently substituted for P450 2F1 sequence in expressing mutants, encoding nine amino acid differences between P450s 2F1 and 2F3: nucleotides 191-278 (amino acids 65-92) and 794-924 (amino acids 265-305). Chimeras constructed to specifically test the importance of these two regions confirmed that P450 2F3 sequence is essential in both regions for expression in E. coli but that other non-P450 2F1 sequence elements outside of these regions also improved the expression of mutant JH_2F_F3_1_007. Mutant JH_2F_F3_1_007 catalyzed the dehydrogenation of 3MI to 3-MEI as indicated by the observation of glutathione adducts after incubation in the presence of glutathione. The JH_2F_F3_1_007 protein differs from P450 2F1 at only 20 amino acids, and should facilitate further studies of the structure(activity relationships of P450s of the 2F subfamily.

Purpose  The current study investigated the associations between sense of purpose with reported physical symptoms, positive and negative affect on days when participants report stressors.    Methods  A subset of the Midlife in the United States study ( n = 1949, m age : 56.4 years) reported their sense of purpose, along with up to eight daily assessments of stressors, affect, and physical symptoms. Multilevel models evaluated whether sense of purpose was associated with deviations in affect or physical symptom reporting on days when participants reported a stressor versus days when they did not.    Results  Sense of purpose was associated with higher daily positive affect, lower daily negative affect, and fewer daily physical symptoms. Compared to individuals who reported lower levels of purpose, those reporting higher levels encountered the same number of daily stressors, yet showed less of an increase in negative affect and physical symptoms on stressor days than on stressor-free days. Purpose did not predict changes in positive affect in response to daily stressors.

In a 77¬†year old lady, with a prior history of a clinically silent infarct of the left MDN, we observed the acute onset of spontaneous confabulations when an isolated new infarct occurred in the right MDN. The patient and five age-matched healthy subjects underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). The thalamic lesions were localized by overlapping Morel Thalamic Atlas with structural MRI data. DTI was used to assess: i) white matter alterations (Fractional Anisotropy, FA) within fibers connecting the ischemic areas to cortex; ii) the micro-structural damage (Mean Diffusivity) within the thalamic sub-regions defined by their structural connectivity to the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) and to the temporal lobes. These target regions were chosen because their damage is considered associated with the appearance of confabulations. Thalamic lesions were localized within the parvocellular regions of the right and left MDNs. The structural connectivity study showed that the fiber tracts, connecting the bilaterally damaged thalamic regions with the frontal cortex, corresponded to the anterior thalamic radiations (ATR). FA within these tracts was significantly lower in the patient as compared to controls. Mean diffusivity within the MDNs projecting to Broadman area (BA) 24, BA25 and BA32 of ACC was significantly higher in the patient than in control group. Mean diffusivity values within the MDN projecting to temporal lobes in contrast were not different between patient and controls. Our findings suggest the involvement of bilateral MDNs projections to ACC in the genesis of confabulations and help provide clarity to the longstanding debate on the origin of confabulations.

These mutations are located within the two domains; the N-terminal RNA binding domain (G51V, G53V, and Y80C) and in the C-terminal ATP binding domain (Y274D, P279S, P279L, G324D, N340S, I382N) including the two important structural elements, the Q-loop (P279S, P279L) and R-loop (G324D). Termination defects of the mutants in primary RNA binding domain and Q-loop could not be restored under any conditions that we tested and these were also defective for most of the other functions of Rho. The termination defects of the mutants (Y274D, G324D and N340S), which were mainly defective for secondary RNA binding and likely defective for translocase activity, could be restored under relaxed in vitro conditions. We also show that a mutation in a primary RNA binding domain (Y80C) can cause a defect in ATP binding and induce distinct conformational changes in the distal C-terminal domain, and these allosteric effects are not predictable from the crystal structure. We conclude that the interactions in the primary RNA binding domain and in the Q-loop are mandatory for RNA release to occur and propose that the interactions in the primary RNA binding modulate most of the other functions of Rho allosterically. The rate of ATP hydrolysis regulates the processivity of translocation along the RNA and is directly correlated with the efficiency of RNA release. NusG improves the speed of RNA release and is not involved in any other step. ",Journal of molecular biology,BIOCHEM
0.634304359,18319715,Inhibition of mTOR pathway by everolimus cooperates with EGFR inhibitors in human tumours sensitive and resistant to anti-EGFR drugs,"Inhibition of a single transduction pathway is often inefficient due to activation of alternative signalling. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key intracellular kinase integrating proliferation, survival and angiogenic pathways and has been implicated in the resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Thus, mTOR blockade is pursued to interfere at multiple levels with tumour growth. We used everolimus (RAD001) to inhibit mTOR, alone or in combination with anti-EGFR drugs gefitinib or cetuximab, on human cancer cell lines sensitive and resistant to EGFR inhibitors, both in vitro and in vivo . We demonstrated that everolimus is active against EGFR-resistant cancer cell lines and partially restores the ability of EGFR inhibitors to inhibit growth and survival. Everolimus reduces the expression of EGFR-related signalling effectors and VEGF production, inhibiting proliferation and capillary tube formation of endothelial cells, both alone and in combination with gefitinib. Finally, combination of everolimus and gefitinib inhibits growth of GEO and GEO-GR (gefitinib resistant) colon cancer xenografts, activation of signalling proteins and VEGF secretion. Targeting mTOR pathway with everolimus overcomes resistance to EGFR inhibitors and produces a cooperative effect with EGFR inhibitors, providing a valid therapeutic strategy to be tested in a clinical setting.",British journal of cancer,ONCO

Cost-effective and innovative strategies to help build older people‚Äôs pain self-management capability are required. This study protocol is designed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a pain self-management app among older people living in the community with arthritic pain. Methods/design This is a phase I feasibility study. A pre-post test study design will be used to trial a freely available pain self-management app named Rheumatoid Arthritis Information Support and Education (‚ÄúRAISE‚Äù) for 14‚Äâdays. Thirty community-dwelling older people living with arthritic pain who use a smartphone will be recruited from (1) various community-based social clubs/organizations/groups or (2) via Facebook groups with potentially high number of older members. In addition, snowballing sampling approach will also be utilized. These participants will trial the RAISE app, which was selected following a systematic evaluation of all available chronic pain apps by the investigator team. A face-to-face or telephone-based meeting will be organized with all consenting participants in order to seek their informed consent, download and set up the intervention app on their mobile device, be provided with app training, and complete the pre-test data (Time 1 (T1)). Participants will be asked to use the RAISE app as desired for 14‚Äâdays. Post-test data collection (Time 2 (T2)) will occur on day 15. Data collected includes participant‚Äôs demographic and clinical information, pain scores, pain self-efficacy, and online technology self-efficacy. Participants will be invited to take part in a semi-structured telephone interview at T2 to explore their experiences of using the app. An evaluation of patterns of app use, recruitment, retention, attrition rates, and analysis of the missing data will inform the study and intervention feasibility. Preliminary outcomes are participant‚Äôs pain intensity and interference, pain self-efficacy, and online technology self-efficacy. Discussion This study will help us better understand the feasibility and acceptability of using this novel intervention among community-dwelling older people living with arthritic pain. The results will also help inform future pain app studies. Trial registration Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12617000921381 .",Pilot and feasibility studies,CLINIC

These typically assume a fixed relationship between the signal of the areas belonging to the same network during the entire time‚Äêseries (e.g., positive correlation between the areas belonging to the same network), or require a priori information about when this relationship may change (task‚Äêdependent changes of connectivity). We present a fully data‚Äêdriven method that identifies transient network configurations that are triggered by the external input and that, therefore, include only regions involved in stimulus/task processing. Intersubject synchronization with short sliding time‚Äêwindows was used to identify if/when any area showed stimulus/task‚Äêrelated responses. Next, a first clustering step grouped together areas that became engaged concurrently and repetitively during the time‚Äêseries (stimulus/task‚Äêrelated networks). Finally, for each network, a second clustering step grouped together all the time‚Äêwindows with the same BOLD signal. The final output consists of a set of network configurations that show stimulus/task‚Äêrelated activity at specific time‚Äêpoints during the fMRI time‚Äêseries. We label these configurations: ‚Äúbrain modes‚Äù (bModes). The method was validated using simulated datasets and a real fMRI experiment with multiple tasks and conditions.

0.275479389,22000018,Structural insights into RNA recognition by RIG-I," Summary  Intracellular RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs, including RIG-I, MDA-5, and LGP-2) recognize viral RNAs as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate an antiviral immune response. To understand the molecular basis of this process, we determined the crystal structure of RIG-I in complex with double-stranded RNA. The dsRNA is sheathed within a network of protein domains that include a conserved ‚Äúhelicase‚Äù domain (regions HEL1 and HEL2), a specialized insertion domain (HEL2i), and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD). A V-shaped pincer connects HEL2 and the CTD by gripping an Œ±-helical shaft that extends from HEL1. In this way, the pincer coordinates functions of all the domains and couples RNA binding with ATP hydrolysis. RIG-I falls within the Dicer-RIG-I clade of super family 2 of helicases and this structure reveals complex interplay between motor domains, accessory mechanical domains and RNA that has implications for understanding the nanomechanical function this protein family and other ATPases more broadly.

0.189977252,23395712,Effects of rhyme and spelling patterns on auditory word ERPs depend on selective attention to phonology," ERP responses to spoken words are sensitive to both rhyming effects and effects of associated spelling patterns. Are such effects automatically elicited by spoken words or dependent on selectively attending to phonology? To address this question, ERP responses to spoken word pairs were investigated under two equally demanding listening tasks that directed selective attention either to sub-syllabic phonology (i.e., rhyme judgments) or to melodies embedded within the words. ERPs elicited when participants selectively attended to phonology demonstrated a rhyming effect that was concurrent with online stimulus encoding and an orthographic effect that emerged later. ERP responses to the same stimuli presented under melodic focus, however, showed no evidence of sensitivity to rhyme or spelling patterns. Results reveal limitations to the automaticity of such ERP effects, suggesting that rhyme effects may depend, at least to some degree, on allocation of attention to phonology, which may in turn activate task-incidental orthographic information.

Objectives: In this review we provide an updated summary of knowledge from the scientific literature on indoor exposures and exacerbation of asthma. Methods: Peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2013 on indoor exposures and exacerbation of asthma were identified through PubMed, from reference lists, and from authors‚Äô files. Articles that focused on modifiable indoor exposures in relation to frequency or severity of exacerbation of asthma were selected for review. Research findings were reviewed and summarized with consideration of the strength of the evidence. Results: Sixty-nine eligible articles were included. Major changed conclusions include a causal relationship with exacerbation for indoor dampness or dampness-related agents (in children); associations with exacerbation for dampness or dampness-related agents (in adults), endotoxin, and environmental tobacco smoke (in preschool children); and limited or suggestive evidence for association with exacerbation for indoor culturable Penicillium or total fungi, nitrogen dioxide, rodents (nonoccupational), feather/down pillows (protective relative to synthetic bedding), and (regardless of specific sensitization) dust mite, cockroach, dog, and dampness-related agents. Discussion: This review, incorporating evidence reported since 2000, increases the strength of evidence linking many indoor factors to the exacerbation of asthma. Conclusions should be considered provisional until all available evidence is examined more thoroughly. Conclusion: Multiple indoor exposures, especially dampness-related agents, merit increased attention to prevent exacerbation of asthma, possibly even in nonsensitized individuals. Additional research to establish causality and evaluate interventions is needed for these and other indoor exposures.

Studies of aggression, dominance, and oxytocin (OT) response in cocaine-treated females are sparse.    Objectives  This study was designed to examine dominance (drinking success) and aggression in a limited-access drinking model of water competition. Acute OT level measures were made on postpartum day (PPD) 36 in several brain regions of interest. Chronic and intermittent cocaine- and saline-treated and untreated rats 10 days post-weaning were tested (without pups) over PPDs 31‚Äì35 following cessation of cocaine treatment 10‚Äì30 days before testing.    Methods  Subjects were water-deprived overnight, and triads consisting of an untreated control (UN), a chronic continuous saline-treated (CS), and chronic continuous cocaine-treated (CC; 30 mg/kg/day throughout gestation) or a UN, an intermittent saline-treated (IS), and an intermittent cocaine-treated (IC; 30 mg/kg two consecutive days every 4 days throughout gestation until PPD 20) female were tested for aggression and drinking behavior during 5 min sessions on five consecutive days. The amygdala, medial preoptic area (MPOA), and ventral tegmental area were assayed for OT levels.    Results  CC and IC females were more aggressive than controls, but only IC females drank more often than controls. OT levels were lower in the MPOA of IC and CC females than in controls.    Conclusions  Findings demonstrate that long after cessation of treatment, CC- and IC-treated non-lactating females (no pups present) had higher rates of aggression, altered drinking behavior, and acutely lower MPOA OT levels.

0.809728348,27557523,Early response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy can help predict long-term survival in patients with cervical cancer,"It is still controversial whether cervical cancer patients with clinical responses after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) have a better long-term survival or not. This study was designed to investigate the effect of the clinical response on the disease-free survival (DFS) of cervical cancer patients undergoing NACT. A total of 853 patients from a retrospective study were used to evaluate whether the clinical response was an indicator for the long-term response, and 493 patients from a prospective cohort study were used for further evaluation. The survival difference was detected by log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox regression and a pooled analysis. The log-rank test revealed that compared with non-responders, the DFS of responders was significantly higher in the retrospective data (P = 0.007). Univariate Cox regression showed that the clinical response was an indicator of long-term survival in the retrospective study (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.18-2.85, P = 0.007). In a multivariate Cox model, the clinical response was still retained as an independent significant prognostic factor in the retrospective study (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.01-2.50, P = 0.046).

As scientific interest in the interplay between physiological and psychological aspects of performance is growing, we aimed to investigate cardiac autonomic control, by means of heart rate variability, and psychological correlates, in competitors of a subarctic ultramarathon, taking place over a 690 km course (temperatures between +5 and ‚àí47¬∞C). At baseline (PRE), after 277 km (D1), 383 km (D2), and post-race (POST, 690 km), heart rate (HR) recordings (supine, 15 min), psychometric measurements (Profile of Mood States/POMS, Borg fatigue, and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale scores both upon arrival and departure) were obtained in 16 competitors (12 men, 4 women, 38.6 ¬± 9.5 years). As not all participants reached the finish line, comparison of finishers (FIN, n = 10) and non-finishers (NON, n = 6), allowed differential assessment of performance. Resting HR increased overall significantly at D1 (FIN +15.9; NON +14.0 bpm), due to a significant decrease in parasympathetic drive. This decrease was in FIN only partially recovered toward POST. In FIN only, baseline HR was negatively correlated with mean velocity [ r ‚àí0.63 (P.04)] and parasympathetic drive [pNN50+: r ‚àí0.67 (P.03)], a lower HR and a higher vagal tone predicting a better performance. Moreover, in FIN, a persistent increase of the long-term self-similarity coefficient, assessed by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFAŒ±2), was retrieved, possibly due to higher alertness. As for psychometrics, at D1, POMS Vigor decreased (FIN: ‚àí7.0; NON: ‚àí3.8), while Fatigue augmented (FIN: +6.9; NON: +5.0). Sleepiness increased only in NON, while Borg scales did not exhibit changes. Baseline comparison of mood states with normative data for athletes displayed significantly higher positive mood in our athletes. Results show that: the race conditions induced early decreases in parasympathetic drive; the extent of vagal withdrawal, associated to the timing of its recovery, is crucial for success; pre-competition lower resting HR predicts a better performance; psychological profile is reliably depicted by POMS, but not by Borg fatigue scales. Therefore, assessment of heart rate variability and psychological profile may monitor and partly predict performance in long-duration ultramarathon in extreme cold environment.",Frontiers in physiology,PHYSIO

We found ten Drosophilid species that were not reported during the last major biodiversity studies, two of which are invasive pests. In addition, we analyzed the influence of seasonal environmental variables characteristic of the subtropical climate zone on Drosophila abundance and biodiversity. We found a significant correlation between temperature and abundance of total Drosophila as well as for six of the seven most represented species individually, with a maximum abundance at intermediate temperatures (18‚Äì26¬∞C). In addition, temperature was positively correlated with biodiversity of Drosophila . Precipitation produced a significant effect on the abundance of five species of Drosophila, with different optima for each species, but did not affect overall biodiversity. We concluded that in the subtropical climate zone of Central Alabama, seasonal temperature and precipitation changes produce a significant effect on Drosophila abundance and biodiversity, while local land use also impacts fly abundance, contributing to an apparent shift in species composition over the last century. We expect global climate change and other anthropogenic factors to further impact Drosophila species composition in the subtropical climate zone into the future.",Ecology and evolution,ECO

However, the presence of multiple isoforms limits the power of conventional biochemical and pharmacological approaches, and calls for a wider application of genetic methodology. Results Taking advantage of sequence data available in public databases, we attempted to provide a prerequisite for such an approach. We made a complete inventory of the Arabidopsis thaliana PLD family, which was found to comprise 12 distinct genes. The current nomenclature of Arabidopsis PLDs was refined and expanded to include five newly described genes. To assess the degree of plant PLD diversity beyond Arabidopsis we explored data from rice (including the genome draft by Monsanto) as well as cDNA and EST sequences from several other plants. Our analysis revealed two major PLD subfamilies in plants. The first, designated C2-PLD, is characterised by presence of the C2 domain and comprises previously known plant PLDs as well as new isoforms with possibly unusual features-catalytically inactive or independent on Ca 2+ . The second subfamily (denoted PXPH-PLD) is novel in plants but is related to animal and fungal enzymes possessing the PX and PH domains. Conclusions The evolutionary dynamics, and inter-specific diversity, of plant PLDs inferred from our phylogenetic analysis, call for more plant species to be employed in PLD research.

OBJECTIVES  To examine the relationship between TBI and premature mortality, particularly by external causes, and determine the role of psychiatric comorbidity.    DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS  We studied all persons born in 1954 or later in Sweden who received inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases -based diagnoses of TBI from 1969 to 2009 (n = 218 300). We compared mortality rates 6 months or more after TBI to general population controls matched on age and sex (n = 2 163 190) and to unaffected siblings of patients with TBI (n = 150 513). Furthermore, we specifically examined external causes of death (suicide, injury, or assault). We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate whether mortality rates differed by sex, age at death, severity (including concussion), and different follow-up times after diagnosis.    MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES  Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of premature death by external causes in patients with TBI compared with general population controls.    RESULTS  Among those who survived 6 months after TBI, we found a 3-fold increased odds of mortality (AOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 3.0-3.4) compared with general population controls and an adjusted increased odds of mortality of 2.6 (95% CI, 2.3-2.8) compared with unaffected siblings. Risks of mortality from external causes were elevated, including for suicide (AOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.9-3.7), injuries (AOR, 4.3; 95% CI, 3.8-4.8), and assault (AOR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.7-5.7). Among those with TBI, absolute rates of death were high in those with any psychiatric or substance abuse comorbidity (3.8% died prematurely) and those with solely substance abuse (6.2%) compared with those without comorbidity (0.5%).    CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE  Traumatic brain injury is associated with substantially elevated risks of premature mortality, particularly for suicide, injuries, and assaults, even after adjustment for sociodemographic and familial factors. Current clinical guidelines may need revision to reduce mortality risks beyond the first few months after injury and address high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and substance abuse.

Androgen receptor has been associated with triple negative breast cancer pathogenesis, but its role in the different subtypes has not been clearly defined. We examined androgen receptor protein expression by immunohistochemical analysis in 678 breast cancers, including 396 triple negative cancers. Fifty matched lymph node metastases were also examined. Association of expression status with clinical (race, survival) and pathological (basal, non-basal subtype, stage, grade) features was also evaluated. In 160 triple negative breast cancers, mRNA microarray expression profiling was performed, and differences according to androgen receptor status were analyzed. In triple negative cancers the percentage of androgen receptor positive cases was lower (24.8% vs 81.6% of non-triple negative cases), especially in African American women (16.7% vs 25.5% of cancers of white women). No significant difference in androgen receptor expression was observed in primary tumors vs matched metastatic lesions. Positive androgen receptor immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with tumor grade (p<0.01) and associated with better overall patient survival (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.032) in the non-basal triple negative cancer group. In the microarray study, expression of three genes ( HER4 , TNFSF10 , CDK6 ) showed significant deregulation in association with androgen receptor status; eg CDK6, a novel therapeutic target in triple negative cancers, showed significantly higher expression level in androgen receptor negative cases (p<0.01). These findings confirm the prognostic impact of androgen receptor expression in non-basal triple negative breast cancers, and suggest targeting of new androgen receptor-related molecular pathways in patients with these cancers.",PloS one,ONCO

In fact, NPF has been identified in many insect species and plays regulatory roles in diverse physiological processes, such as feeding, learning, reproduction and stress responses. NPF operates by interacting with the NPF receptor (NPFR). Here, we characterized and determined the presumed role of NPF signaling in the wingless parthenogenetic pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum . Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that the expression levels of both NPF and NPFR transcripts varied across developmental stages, which implies that the NPF signaling system might participate in the developmental regulation of aphid physiological processes or behaviors. The NPF transcript was mainly detected in the head but not in the gut, whereas the NPFR transcript was mainly detected in both the gut and head. In addition, the NPF transcript levels were markedly up-regulated in starved aphids compared with satiated aphids, and the transcript levels recovered after re-feeding. In contrast, the NPFR transcript levels remained stable in starved and re-fed aphids. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown by the injection of NPF dsRNA into wingless adult aphids significantly reduced their food intake. Further analysis of the modification of aphid feeding behavior on broad bean plants using electrical penetration graphs (EPGs) revealed that both the probing time and the total duration of phloem activity decreased significantly in the NPF treatment group. These results indicated a lower appetite for food after NPF knockdown, which could explain the reduction in aphid food intake. NPF silencing was also shown to reduce reproduction but not survival in aphids. Overall, the results of these experiments suggest that NPF plays an important role in regulation of feeding in A. pisum .",Frontiers in physiology,PHYSIO

0.38449775,24512349,Controlled intramyocardial release of engineered chemokines by biodegradable hydrogels as a treatment approach of myocardial infarction,"Myocardial infarction (MI) induces a complex inflammatory immune response, followed by the remodelling of the heart muscle and scar formation. The rapid regeneration of the blood vessel network system by the attraction of hematopoietic stem cells is beneficial for heart function. Despite the important role of chemokines in these processes, their use in clinical practice has so far been limited by their limited availability over a long time-span in vivo . Here, a method is presented to increase physiological availability of chemokines at the site of injury over a defined time-span and simultaneously control their release using biodegradable hydrogels. Two different biodegradable hydrogels were implemented, a fast degradable hydrogel (FDH) for delivering Met-CCL5 over 24 hrs and a slow degradable hydrogel (SDH) for a gradual release of protease-resistant CXCL12 (S4V) over 4 weeks. We demonstrate that the time-controlled release using Met-CCL5-FDH and CXCL12 (S4V)-SDH suppressed initial neutrophil infiltration, promoted neovascularization and reduced apoptosis in the infarcted myocardium. Thus, we were able to significantly preserve the cardiac function after MI. This study demonstrates that time-controlled, biopolymer-mediated delivery of chemokines represents a novel and feasible strategy to support the endogenous reparatory mechanisms after MI and may compliment cell-based therapies.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,ENG
0.000344615,26201073,Heat Transfer Modeling of an Annular On-Line Spray Water Cooling Process for Electric-Resistance-Welded Steel Pipe,"On-line spray water cooling (OSWC) of electric-resistance-welded (ERW) steel pipes can replace the conventional off-line heat treatment process and become an important and critical procedure. The OSWC process improves production efficiency, decreases costs, and enhances the mechanical properties of ERW steel pipe, especially the impact properties of the weld joint. In this paper, an annular OSWC process is investigated based on an experimental simulation platform that can obtain precise real-time measurements of the temperature of the pipe, the water pressure and flux, etc. The effects of the modes of annular spray water cooling and related cooling parameters on the mechanical properties of the pipe are investigated. The temperature evolutions of the inner and outer walls of the pipe are measured during the spray water cooling process, and the uniformity of mechanical properties along the circumferential and longitudinal directions is investigated. A heat transfer coefficient model of spray water cooling is developed based on measured temperature data in conjunction with simulation using the finite element method. Industrial tests prove the validity of the heat transfer model of a steel pipe undergoing spray water cooling. The research results can provide a basis for the industrial application of the OSWC process in the production of ERW steel pipes.",PloS one,CHEM

Scientific studies assessing the situation of the patients with chronic diseases in this context are scarce. We aimed to characterise medical care for chronically ill migrants without health insurance and outline its possibilities and limitations from the treating physicians‚Äô perspective. Design Qualitative semi-structured interviews; qualitative content analysis. Setting Organisations and facilities providing healthcare for uninsured migrants: free clinics, medical practices and public health services. Participants 14 physicians working regularly in healthcare for uninsured migrants. Results Delayed contact to the healthcare system was frequently addressed in the interviews. Care was described as constrained by a scarcity of resources that often impedes adequate treatment for many conditions, most pronounced in the case of oncological diseases or chronic viral infections (HIV, hepatitis). For other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases or diabetes, some diagnostics and basic medications were described as partially available, while management of complications or rehabilitative measures are frequently unfeasible. For the patients with mental health problems, attainability of psychotherapeutic treatment is reported as severely limited. Care is predominantly described as fragmented with limitations to information flow and continuity. Which level of care a patient receives appears to depend markedly on the respective non-governmental organisation and the individual commitment, subjective decisions and personal connections of the treating physician. Conclusions Restrictions in medical care for uninsured migrants have even more impact on chronically ill patients. Volunteer-based care often constitutes an inadequate compensation for regular access to the healthcare system, as it is strongly influenced by the limitation of its resources and its arbitrariness.",BMJ open,EPIDEM
0.602353463,30038220,Tumor innate immunity primed by specific interferon-stimulated endogenous retroviruses," Mesenchymal tumor subpopulations secrete pro-tumorigenic cytokines and promote treatment resistance 1 ‚Äì 4 . This phenomenon has been implicated in chemorefractory small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and resistance to targeted therapies 5 ‚Äì 8 , but remains incompletely defined. Here we identify a subclass of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) that engages innate immune signaling in these cells. S timulated 3 P rime A ntisense R etroviral C oding S equences (SPARCS) are oriented inversely in 3‚Ä≤UTRs of specific genes enriched for regulation by STAT1 and EZH2. De-repression of these loci results in dsRNA generation following IFNŒ≥ exposure due to bi-directional transcription from the STAT1-activated gene promoter and the 5‚Ä≤ LTR of the antisense ERV. Engagement of MAVS and STING activates downstream TBK1, IRF3, and STAT1 signaling, sustaining a positive feedback loop. SPARCS induction in human tumors is tightly associated with MHC class 1 expression, mesenchymal markers, and downregulation of chromatin modifying enzymes, including EZH2. Analysis of cell lines with high inducible SPARCS expression reveals strong association with an AXL/MET positive mesenchymal cell state. While SPARCS high tumors are immune infiltrated, they also exhibit multiple features of an immune suppressed microenviroment. Together, these data unveil a subclass of ERVs whose de-repression triggers pathologic innate immune signaling in cancer, with important implications for cancer immunotherapy.

0.540151794,25637799,Stimulation of glutamate receptors in the ventral tegmental area is necessary for serotonin-2 receptor-induced increases in mesocortical dopamine release," Modulation of dopamine (DA) released by serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors has been implicated in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. The mesocortical DA system has been implicated particularly in the cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia. Agonism at 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex is associated with increases in cortical DA release. Evidence indicates that 5-HT2A receptors in the cortex regulate mesocortical DA release through stimulation of a ‚Äúlong-loop‚Äù feedback system from the PFC to the VTA and back. However, a causal role for VTA glutamate in the 5-HT2-induced increases in PFC DA has not been established. The present study does so by measuring 5-HT2 agonist-induced DA release in the cortex after infusions of glutamate antagonists into the VTA. Infusions of a combination of a NMDA (AP-5: 2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid) and an AMPA/kainate (CNQX: 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) receptor antagonist into the VTA blocked the increases in cortical DA produced by administration of the 5-HT2 agonist DOI [(¬±)-2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine] (2.5 mg/kg s.c.). These results demonstrate that stimulation of glutamate receptors in the VTA is necessary for 5-HT2 agonist-induced increases in cortical DA. ",Neuroscience,NEURO
0.127183606,23199038,Advanced proteomics procedure as a detection tool for predictive screening in type 2 pre-Diabetes,"It has been suggested that a more precise selection of predictive biomarkers may prove useful in the early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), even when glucose tolerance is normal. This is vital since many T2D cases may be preventable by avoiding those factors that trigger the disease process (primary prevention) or by use of therapy that modulates the disease process before the onset of clinical symptoms (secondary prevention) occurs. The selection of predictive markers must be carefully assessed and depends mainly on three important parameters: sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. Unfortunately, biomarkers with ideal specificity and sensitivity are difficult to find. One potential solution is to use the combinatorial power of different biomarkers, each of which alone may not offer satisfactory specificity and sensitivity. Recent technological advances in proteomics and bioinformatics offer a great opportunity for the discovery of different potential predictive markers. In this review, we described a cellular T2D model as an example with the intent of providing specific enrichment and new identification strategies, which might have the potential to improve predictive biomarker identification and to bring accuracy in disease diagnosis and classification, as well as therapeutic monitoring in the early phase of T2D.",The EPMA journal,CLINIC

0.878754134,22069390,"Information Domain Approach to the Investigation of Cardio-Vascular, Cardio-Pulmonary, and Vasculo-Pulmonary Causal Couplings","The physiological mechanisms related to cardio-vascular (CV), cardio-pulmonary (CP), and vasculo-pulmonary (VP) regulation may be probed through multivariate time series analysis tools. This study applied an information domain approach for the evaluation of non-linear causality to the beat-to-beat variability series of heart period ( t ), systolic arterial pressure ( s ), and respiration ( r ) measured during tilt testing and paced breathing (PB) protocols. The approach quantifies the causal coupling from the series i to the series j ( C ij ) as the amount of information flowing from i to j . A measure of directionality is also obtained as the difference between two reciprocal causal couplings ( D i,j = C ij ‚àí‚ÄâC ji ). Significant causal coupling and directionality were detected respectively when the median of C ij over subjects was positive ( C ij >‚Äâ0), and when D i,j was statistically different from zero ( D i,j >‚Äâ0 or D i,j <‚Äâ0). The method was applied on t , s , and r series measured in 15 healthy subjects (22‚Äì32‚Äâyears, 8 males) in the supine (su) and upright (up) positions, and in further 15 subjects (21‚Äì29‚Äâyears, 7 males) during spontaneous (sp) and paced (pa) breathing. In the control condition (su, sp), a significant causal coupling was observed for C rs , C rt , C st , and C ts , and significant directionality was present only from r to t ( D r,t >‚Äâ0). During head-up tilt (up, sp), C rs was preserved, C rt decreased to zero median, and C st and C ts increased significantly; directionality vanished between r and t ( D r,t =‚Äâ0) and raised from s to t ( D s,t >‚Äâ0). During PB (su, pa), C rs increased significantly, C rt and C ts were preserved, and C st decreased to zero median; directionality was preserved from r to t ( D r,t >‚Äâ0), and raised from r to s ( D r,s >‚Äâ0). These results suggest that the approach may reflect modifications of CV, CP, and VP mechanisms consequent to altered physiological conditions, such as the baroreflex engagement and the dampening of respiratory sinus arrhythmia induced by tilt, or the respiratory driving on arterial pressure induced by PB. Thus, it could be suggested as a tool for the non-invasive monitoring of CV and cardiorespiratory control systems in normal and impaired conditions.",Frontiers in physiology,PHYSIO

Design A case‚Äìcontrol study. Setting Beijing, China. Participants We selected 124 fetuses with a CHD and a normal karyotype and normal array-based comparative genomic hybridisation analysis and compared them with 124 normal fetuses matched for gestational age and sex. Fetuses with a CHD, from 20 to 32‚ÄÖweeks of gestation were included. Fetuses with any chromosomal abnormalities, and fetuses from multiple pregnancies and those carried by pregnant women with chronic diseases, were excluded from this research. DNA extraction and genotyping were carried out for all cases to investigate the genotype distributions of GDF1 rs4808863. Results A significant difference was noted for the CT phenotype of GDF1 rs4808863 between the controls and the fetuses with CHDs using homozygote and heterozygote comparisons. The minor allele (T allele) of GDF1 rs4808863 was associated with an increased risk of CHD (p<0.05). A statistically significant difference between controls and fetuses with CHDs was noted in a comparison with the mutation genotype CT+TT and wild-type genotype CC (p<0.05) using dominant modal analysis.

Design  Information on ‚Äòpopulation group‚Äô classification (‚ÄòBlack‚Äô, ‚ÄòColoured‚Äô, ‚ÄòIndian‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhite‚Äô, as defined under apartheid legislation) and place of delivery, together with basic obstetric, sociodemographic and perinatal data, were extracted from the birth notification forms of 5456 children who made up the birth cohort of the Birth to Ten longitudinal study. This cohort included all births that occurred to mothers resident in Soweto-Johannesburg during a 7-week period in 1990.    Results  After accounting for differences in maternal age, gravidity, birth weight and gestational age at delivery, the rate of caesarean sections at private facilities was more than twice that at public facilities. Although there were significant differences in the utilisation of private facilities by women from different ‚Äòpopulation groups‚Äô, there was an independent effect of ‚Äòpopulation group‚Äô classification on caesarean section rates: caesarean section rates among women classified as ‚ÄòWhite‚Äô and ‚ÄòColoured‚Äô were significantly higher (95% confidence intervals for odds ratios: 1.40-2.42 and 1.05-1.81, respectively) than among women classified as ‚ÄòBlack‚Äô.    Conclusion  ‚ÄòPopulation group‚Äô differences in caesarean section rates among South African women are not explained by differences in demographic risk factors for assisted delivery, nor by differences in access to private health care. Instead, the differences in section rates may reflect the effect of bias in clinical decision-making, and/or differences among women from different ‚Äòpopulation groups‚Äô in their attitude towards assisted delivery, and their capacity to negotiate with clinicians.

Epidemiological data from purposively-designed and standardized surveys were available for 31,458 schoolchildren (90% aged between 6-16 years) from 459 locations across the region and used in combination with remote sensing environmental data to identify factors associated with spatial variation in infection patterns. The geostatistical model explicitly takes into account the highly aggregated distribution of parasite distribution by fitting a negative binomial distribution to the data and accounts for spatial correlation. Results identify the role of environmental risk factors in explaining geographical heterogeneity in infection intensity and show how these factors can be used to develop a predictive map. Such a map has important implications for schisosomiasis control programmes in the region. ",Parasitology,EPIDEM

We varied the payoffs for correct responses in two temporally-overlapping recognition tasks, a visual array comparison task and a tone sequence comparison task. In the critical conditions, an increase in reward for one task corresponded to a decrease in reward for the concurrent task, but memory load remained constant. Our results show patterns of interference consistent with a trade-off between the tasks, suggesting that a shared resource can be flexibly divided, rather than only fully allotted to either of the tasks. Our findings support a role for a domain-general resource in models of working memory, and furthermore suggest that this resource is flexibly divisible.

The general aim of this contribution is to deal with experimental data obtained from yeast cells and from yeast cultures to attempt the integration of the two levels of information, individual and population, to progress in the control of yeast biotechnological processes by means of the overall analysis of this set of experimental data, and to assist in the improvement of an individual-based model, namely, INDISIM- Saccha . Populations of S. cerevisiae growing in liquid batch culture, in aerobic and microaerophilic conditions, were studied. A set of digital images was taken during the population growth, and a protocol for the treatment and analyses of the images obtained was established. The piecewise linear model of Buchanan was adjusted to the temporal evolutions of the yeast populations to determine the kinetic parameters and changes of growth phases. In parallel, for all the yeast cells analyzed, values of direct morphological parameters, such as area, perimeter, major diameter, minor diameter, and derived ones, such as circularity and elongation, were obtained. Graphical and numerical methods from descriptive statistics were applied to these data to characterize the growth phases and the budding state of the yeast cells in both experimental conditions, and inferential statistical methods were used to compare the diverse groups of data achieved. Oxidative metabolism of yeast in a medium with oxygen available and low initial sugar concentration can be taken into account in order to obtain a greater number of cells or larger cells. Morphological parameters were analyzed statistically to identify which were the most useful for the discrimination of the different states, according to budding and/or growth phase, in aerobic and microaerophilic conditions. The use of the experimental data for subsequent modeling work was then discussed and compared to simulation results generated with INDISIM- Saccha , which allowed us to advance in the development of this yeast model, and illustrated the utility of data at different levels of observation and the needs and logic behind the development of a microbial individual-based model.",Frontiers in microbiology,ANIMAL

In this study, we have focused on the glucocorticoid-regulated anti-inflammatory mediator annexin 1. Induction of peritonitis in wild-type mice rapidly (4 h) produced the expected signs of inflammation, including marked activation of resident cells (e.g., mast cells), migration of blood-borne leukocytes, mirrored by blood neutrophilia. These changes subsided after 48‚Äì96 h. In annexin 1 null mice, the peritonitis response was exaggerated (‚àº40% at 4 h), with increased granulocyte migration and cytokine production. In blood leukocytes, annexin 1 gene expression was activated at 4, but not 24, h postzymosan, whereas protein levels were increased at both time points. Locally, endothelial and mast cell annexin 1 gene expression was not detectable in basal conditions, whereas it was switched on during the inflammatory response. The significance of annexin 1 system plasticity in the anti-inflammatory properties of dexamethasone was assessed. Clear induction of annexin 1 gene in response to dexamethasone treatment was evident in the circulating and migrated leukocytes, and in connective tissue mast cells; this was associated with the steroid failure to inhibit leukocyte trafficking, cytokine synthesis, and mast cell degranulation in the annexin 1 null mouse. In conclusion, understanding how inflammation is brought under control will help clarify the complex interplay between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways operating during the host response to injury and infection.

TMPO (LAP2) plays dual roles of either suppressing or promoting proliferation of cells, depending on the status of the cell. It has been reported that TMPO is up-regulated in various cancer types. However, its function in lung cancer has not been studied yet. Materials and methods: A series of clinical microarray datasets for lung cancer were investigated to demonstrate the expression of TMPO. The transcription of TMPO gene in human lung cancer was analyzed using Oncomine platform (www.oncomine.org) according to the standardized procedures described previously. Four separate datasets (Hou Lung, Okayama Lung, Beer Lung, and Garber Lung) were analyzed. Results: Here, we show that TMPO is over-expressed in lung cancer tissues, and that a high level of TMPO indicates a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Knockdown of TMPO in lung cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. Also, down-regulation of TMPO leads to an impaired metastatic ability of tumor cells. A nude mice tumor model show that knockdown of TMPO suppresses tumor formation in vivo.

Bovine uterine epithelial or MDBK cells were cultured in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of each rbIFN for 24, 48, or 72 h. Transcript levels of the IFN-stimulated genes ( ISG s) ISG12 , ISG15 , MX1 , and MX2 were analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These messenger RNAs were up-regulated by rbIFN in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In the epithelial cells, the ISG12 transcript level increased at 48 h after rbIFN treatment but slightly decreased at 72 h, whereas the transcript level of ISG15 increased at 24 h and was maintained through 72 h. Expressions of MX1 and MX2 increased at 72 h after rbIFN treatment. MX1 expression increased in all treatment groups, but MX2 increased only by bIFNTc1. In MDBK cells, the expression of ISG12 was increased by bIFNT1 and bIFNTc1 after 24 and 72 h; however, it was unchanged by rbIFNA. ISG15 increased following the same pattern as that seen in uterine epithelial cells, and MX1 showed a similar expression pattern. MX2 expression was increased by bIFNTc1 treatment in uterine epithelial cells, and its expression was increased by both bIFNT1 and bIFNTc1 in MDBK cells. These results show that epithelial and MDBK cell responses to IFNs differ, suggesting that IFNs possess common functions, but may have acquired different functions following gene duplication.",Asian-Australasian journal of animal sciences,ANIMAL
0.244902453,24642144,Paget disease of bone-associated UBA domain mutations of  SQSTM1  exert distinct effects on protein structure and function,"SQSTM1 mutations are common in patients with Paget disease of bone (PDB), with most affecting the C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of the SQSTM1 protein. We performed structural and functional analyses of two UBA domain mutations, an I424S mutation relatively common in UK PDB patients, and an A427D mutation associated with a severe phenotype in Southern Italian patients. Both impaired SQSTM1's ubiquitin-binding function in pull-down assays and resulted in activation of basal NF-Œ∫B signalling, compared to wild-type, in reporter assays. We found evidence for a relationship between the ability of different UBA domain mutants to activate NF-Œ∫B signalling in vitro and number of affected sites in vivo in 1152 PDB patients from the UK and Italy, with A427D-SQSTM1 producing the greatest level of activation (relative to wild-type) of all PDB mutants tested to date. NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry studies were able to demonstrate that I424S is associated with global structural changes in the UBA domain, resulting in 10-fold weaker UBA dimer stability than wild-type and reduced ubiquitin-binding affinity of the UBA monomer. Our observations provide insights into the role of SQSTM1-mediated NF-Œ∫B signalling in PDB aetiology, and demonstrate that different mutations in close proximity within loop 2/helix 3 of the SQSTM1 UBA domain exert distinct effects on protein structure and stability, including indirect effects at the UBA/ubiquitin-binding interface. Highlights ‚Ä¢ The I424S and A427D SQSTM1 mutations affect ubiquitin-binding and NF-Œ∫B signalling. ‚Ä¢ Mutant SQSTM1's ability to activate NF-Œ∫B signalling may be related to disease extent in PDB. ‚Ä¢ A427D-SQSTM1 produces the greatest activation (relative to wild-type) of all PDB mutants. ‚Ä¢ The I424S mutant destabilises the UBA dimer causing unfolding of the monomer. ‚Ä¢ UBA domain mutations of SQSTM1 exert distinct effects on protein structure and stability.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,BIOCHEM

CB03234"," Tiancimycin (TNM) A, a recently discovered enediyne natural product from Streptomyces sp. CB03234, showed rapid and complete killing of cancer cells and could be used as a payload in antibody drug conjugates. The low yield of TNM A in the wild-type strain promoted us to use ribosome engineering and fermentation optimization for its yield improvement. The Streptomyces sp. CB03234-R-16 mutant strain with a L422P mutation in RpoB, the RNA polymerase Œ≤ -subunit, was obtained from the rifamycin-resistant screening. After fermentation optimization, the titers of TNM A in Streptomyces sp.

0.808733631,28979800,Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with mitochondrial DNA methylation," Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) has detrimental effects on fetal development and on the health of the offspring into adulthood. Energy homeostasis through ATP production via the mitochondria (mt) plays a key role during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine if MSDP resulted in differences in DNA methylation to the placental mitochondrial chromosome at the transcription and replication control region, the D-Loop, and if these differences were also present in an alternate neonatal tissue (foreskin) in an independent birth cohort. We investigated mtDNA methylation by bisulfite-pyrosequencing in two sections of the D-Loop control region and in long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) genomic sequences in placenta from 96 mother‚Äìnewborn pairs that were enrolled in a Rhode Island birth cohort along with foreskin samples from 62 infants from a Kentucky birth cohort. In both placenta and foreskin, mtDNA methylation in the light chain D-Loop region 1 was positively associated with MSDP in placenta (difference+2.73%) ( P =0.001) and foreskin (difference+1.22%) ( P =0.08). Additionally, in foreskin, a second segment of the D-Loop-heavy chain region 1 showed a small but significant change in methylation with MSDP (+0.4%, P =0.04). No methylation changes were noted in either tissue at the LINE-1 repetitive element. We identified a similar pattern of epigenetic effect to mitochondria arising in cells from different primordial lineages and in different populations, associated with MSDP. These robust and consistent results build evidence that MSDP may impact mt D-Loop methylation, as one mechanism through which this exposure affects newborn health.

0.870718183,29097183,VANGL2 interacts with integrin Œ±v to regulate matrix metalloproteinase activity and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix," Planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins are implicated in a variety of morphogenetic processes including embryonic cell migration and potentially cancer progression. During zebrafish gastrulation, the transmembrane protein Vang-like 2 (VANGL2) is required for PCP and directed cell migration. These cell behaviors occur in the context of a fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM). While it is thought that interactions with the ECM regulate cell migration, it is unclear how PCP proteins such as VANGL2 influence these events. Using an in vitro cell culture model system, we previously showed that human VANGL2 negatively regulates membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP14) and activation of secreted matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Here, we investigated the functional relationship between VANGL2, integrin Œ±vŒ≤3, and MMP2 activation. We provide evidence that VANGL2 regulates cell surface integrin Œ±vŒ≤3 expression and adhesion to fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin. Inhibition of MMP14/MMP2 activity suppressed the cell adhesion defect in VANGL2 knockdown cells. Furthermore, our data show that MMP14 and integrin Œ±v are required for increased proteolysis by VANGL2 knockdown cells. Lastly, we have identified integrin Œ±vŒ≤3 as a novel VANGL2 binding partner. Together, these findings begin to dissect the molecular underpinnings of how VANGL2 regulates MMP activity and cell adhesion to the ECM. ",Experimental cell research,BIOCHEM
0.94212484,18567005,Accurate Solution of Multi-Region Continuum Biomolecule Electrostatic Problems Using the Linearized Poisson-Boltzmann Equation with Curved Boundary Elements," We present a boundary-element method (BEM) implementation for accurately solving problems in biomolecular electrostatics using the linearized Poisson‚ÄìBoltzmann equation. Motivating this implementation is the desire to create a solver capable of precisely describing the geometries and topologies prevalent in continuum models of biological molecules. This implementation is enabled by the synthesis of four technologies developed or implemented specifically for this work. First, molecular and accessible surfaces used to describe dielectric and ion-exclusion boundaries were discretized with curved boundary elements that faithfully reproduce molecular geometries. Second, we avoided explicitly forming the dense BEM matrices and instead solved the linear systems with a preconditioned iterative method (GMRES), using a matrix compression algorithm (FFTSVD) to accelerate matrix-vector multiplication. Third, robust numerical integration methods were employed to accurately evaluate singular and near-singular integrals over the curved boundary elements. Finally, we present a general boundary-integral approach capable of modeling an arbitrary number of embedded homogeneous dielectric regions with differing dielectric constants, possible salt treatment, and point charges. A comparison of the presented BEM implementation and standard finite-difference techniques demonstrates that for certain classes of electrostatic calculations, such as determining absolute electrostatic solvation and rigid-binding free energies, the improved convergence properties of the BEM approach can have a significant impact on computed energetics. We also demonstrate that the improved accuracy offered by the curved-element BEM is important when more sophisticated techniques, such as non-rigid-binding models, are used to compute the relative electrostatic effects of molecular modifications. In addition, we show that electrostatic calculations requiring multiple solves using the same molecular geometry, such as charge optimization or component analysis, can be computed to high accuracy using the presented BEM approach, in compute times comparable to traditional finite-difference methods.

0.406418277,27752312,Improving Emergency Department flow through optimized bed utilization,"Over the last decade, patient volumes in the emergency department (ED) have grown disproportionately compared to the increase in staffing and resources at the Toronto Western Hospital, an academic tertiary care centre in Toronto, Canada. The resultant congestion has spilled over to the ED waiting room, where medically undifferentiated and potentially unstable patients must wait until a bed becomes available. The aim of this quality improvement project was to decrease the 90th percentile of wait time between triage and bed assignment (time-to-bed) by half, from 120 to 60 minutes, for our highest acuity patients. We engaged key stakeholders to identify barriers and potential strategies to achieve optimal flow of patients into the ED. We first identified multiple flow-interrupting challenges, including operational bottlenecks and cultural issues. We then generated change ideas to address two main underlying causes of ED congestion: unnecessary patient utilization of ED beds and communication breakdown causing bed turnaround delays. We subsequently performed seven tests of change through sequential plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. The most significant gains were made by improving communication strategies: small gains were achieved through the optimization of in-house digital information management systems, while significant improvements were achieved through the implementation of a low-tech direct contact mechanism (a two-way radio or walkie-talkie). In the post-intervention phase, time-to-bed for the 90th percentile of high-acuity patients decreased from 120 minutes to 66 minutes, with special cause variation showing a significant shift in the weekly measurements.",BMJ quality improvement reports,CLINIC
0.643000775,18823527,A genome-wide association study for late-onset Alzheimer's disease using DNA pooling,"Background Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is an age related neurodegenerative disease with a high prevalence that places major demands on healthcare resources in societies with increasingly aged populations. The only extensively replicable genetic risk factor for LOAD is the apolipoprotein E gene. In order to identify additional genetic risk loci we have conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study in a large LOAD case ‚Äì control sample, reducing costs through the use of DNA pooling. Methods DNA samples were collected from 1,082 individuals with LOAD and 1,239 control subjects. Age at onset ranged from 60 to 95 and Controls were matched for age (mean = 76.53 years, SD = 33), gender and ethnicity. Equimolar amounts of each DNA sample were added to either a case or control pool. The pools were genotyped using Illumina HumanHap300 and Illumina Sentrix HumanHap240S arrays testing 561,494 SNPs. 114 of our best hit SNPs from the pooling data were identified and then individually genotyped in the case ‚Äì control sample used to construct the pools. Results Highly significant association with LOAD was observed at the APOE locus confirming the validity of the pooled genotyping approach. For 109 SNPs outside the APOE locus, we obtained uncorrected p-values ‚â§ 0.05 for 74 after individual genotyping. To further test these associations, we added control data from 1400 subjects from the 1958 Birth Cohort with the evidence for association increasing to 3.4 √ó 10 -6 for our strongest finding, rs727153. rs727153 lies 13 kb from the start of transcription of lecithin retinol acyltransferase (phosphatidylcholine ‚Äì retinol O-acyltransferase, LRAT ). Five of seven tag SNPs chosen to cover LRAT showed significant association with LOAD with a SNP in intron 2 of LRAT , showing greatest evidence of association (rs201825, p-value = 6.1 √ó 10 -7 ). Conclusion We have validated the pooling method for GWA studies by both identifying the APOE locus and by observing a strong enrichment for significantly associated SNPs. We provide evidence for LRAT as a novel candidate gene for LOAD. LRAT plays a prominent role in the Vitamin A cascade, a system that has been previously implicated in LOAD.",BMC medical genomics,POPGENE

Design Population based cohort study. Setting Danish hospitals and private fertility clinics. Participants 54‚Äâ362 women with infertility problems referred to all Danish fertility clinics during 1963-98. The median age at first evaluation of infertility was 30 years (range 16-55 years), and the median age at the end of follow-up was 47 (range 18-81) years. Included in the analysis were 156 women with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (cases) and 1241 subcohort members identified in the cohort during follow-up in 2006. Main outcome measure Effect of four groups of fertility drugs (gonadotrophins, clomifene citrate, human chorionic gonadotrophin, and gonadotrophin releasing hormone) on overall risk of ovarian cancer after adjustment for potential confounding factors.

0.40533506,25917784,Interleukin 6 Increases Production of Cytokines by Colonic Innate Lymphoid Cells in Mice and Patients With Chronic Intestinal Inflammation,"Background & Aims Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a heterogeneous group of mucosal inflammatory cells that participate in chronic intestinal inflammation. We investigated the role of interleukin 6 (IL6) in inducing activation of ILCs in mice and in human beings with chronic intestinal inflammation. Methods ILCs were isolated from colons of Tbx21 -/- √ó Rag2 -/- mice (TRUC), which develop colitis; patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); and patients without colon inflammation (controls). ILCs were characterized by flow cytometry; cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cytokine bead arrays. Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of depleting (CD4, CD90), neutralizing (IL6), or control antibodies. Isolated colon tissues were analyzed by histology, explant organ culture, and cell culture. Bacterial DNA was extracted from mouse fecal samples to assess the intestinal microbiota. Results IL17A- and IL22-producing, natural cytotoxicity receptor‚Äìnegative, ILC3 were the major subset of ILCs detected in colons of TRUC mice. Combinations of IL23 and IL1Œ± induced production of cytokines by these cells, which increased further after administration of IL6. Antibodies against IL6 reduced colitis in TRUC mice without significantly affecting the structure of their intestinal microbiota. Addition of IL6 increased production of IL17A, IL22, and interferon-Œ≥ by human intestinal CD3-negative, IL7-receptor‚Äìpositive cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions IL6 contributes to activation of colonic natural cytotoxicity receptor‚Äìnegative, CD4-negative, ILC3s in mice with chronic intestinal inflammation (TRUC mice) by increasing IL23- and IL1Œ±-induced production of IL17A and IL22. This pathway might be targeted to treat patients with IBD because IL6, which is highly produced in colonic tissue by some IBD patients, also increased the production of IL17A, IL22, and interferon-Œ≥ by cultured human colon CD3-negative, IL7-receptor‚Äìpositive cells.",Gastroenterology,BIOCHEM

In this prospective study, we performed prespecified subgroup analysis according to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as an eGFR <60‚Äâml/min per 1.73‚Äâm 2 . Blood pressure was lower in the combined therapy than in the high-dose ARB cohort in both groups with and without CKD. In patients with CKD, significantly more primary events (a composite of cardiovascular events and noncardiovascular death) occurred in the high-dose ARB group than in the combination group (30 vs. 16, respectively, hazard ratio 2.25). Significantly more cerebrovascular and more heart failure events occurred in the high-dose ARB group than in the combination group. In patients without CKD, however, the incidence of primary events was similar between the two treatments. The treatment-by-subgroup interaction was significant. Allocation to the high-dose ARB was a significant independent prognostic factor for primary events in patients with CKD. Thus, the ARB plus CCB combination conferred greater benefit in prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with CKD compared with high-dose ARB alone.

0.904727524,29960887,Dissecting FcŒ≥R Regulation Through a Multivalent Binding Model," Many immune receptors transduce activation across the plasma membrane through their clustering. With FcŒ≥ receptors, this clustering is driven by binding to antibodies of differing affinities that are in turn bound to multivalent antigen. As a consequence of this activation mechanism, accounting for and rationally manipulating IgG effector function is complicated by, among other factors, differing affinities between FcŒ≥R species and changes in the valency of antigen binding. In this study, we show that a model of multivalent receptor-ligand binding can effectively account for the contribution of IgG-FcŒ≥R affinity and immune complex valency. This model in turn enables us to make specific predictions about the effect of immune complexes of defined composition. In total, these results enable both rational immune complex design for a desired IgG effector function and the deconvolution of effector function by immune complexes.   eTOC Blurb  Robinett et al. show that a multivalent binding model can predict antibody binding to immune effector cells. By using this model with measurements of the FcŒ≥R combinations expressed across effector populations, they are able to predict the outcome of tumor-targeted antibodies and identify the essential innate cell types. These results inform the further rational design of therapeutic antibodies and potentially antibody combinations.   ",Cell systems,BIOCHEM

Analysis of null mutants showed that Gli3 is involved at the transitions from DN1 to CD4 + CD8 + DN (DN2) cell and from DN to CD4 + CD8 + double-positive (DP) cell. Gli3 is required for differentiation from DN to DP thymocyte, after pre‚ÄìT-cell receptor (TCR) signaling but is not necessary for pre-TCR‚Äìinduced proliferation or survival. The effect of Gli3 was dose dependent, suggesting its direct involvement in the transcriptional regulation of genes controlling T-cell differentiation during fetal development. ",Blood,BIOCHEM

Methods Joinpoint regression analysis and the age‚Äìperiod‚Äìcohort (APC) model were used to analyze the lung cancer incidence trends in Sihui, Guangdong province, China between 1987 and 2011, and explore the possible causes of these trends. Results A total of 2,397 lung cancer patients were involved in this study. A 3-fold increase in the incidence of lung cancer in both sexes was observed over the 25-year period. Joinpoint regression analysis showed that while the incidence continued to increase steadily in females during the entire period, a sharp acceleration was observed in males starting in 2005. The full APC model was selected to describe age, period, and birth cohort effects on lung cancer incidence trends in Sihui. The age cohorts in both sexes showed a continuously significant increase in the relative risk (RR) of lung cancer, with a peak in the eldest age group (80‚Äì84¬†years).

0.356239562,29879714,Dialysate Potassium and Mortality in a Prospective Hemodialysis Cohort,"  Background  Studies examining the association of dialysate potassium concentration and mortality in hemodialysis patients show conflicting findings. We hypothesized that low dialysate potassium concentrations are associated with higher mortality, particularly in patients with high pre-dialysis serum potassium concentrations.    Methods  We evaluated 624 hemodialysis patients from the prospective Malnutrition, Diet, and Racial Disparities in Kidney Disease study recruited from 16 outpatient dialysis facilities over 2011-15 who underwent protocolized collection of dialysis treatment characteristics every six months. We examined the association of dialysate potassium concentration, categorized as 1, 2, and 3mEq/L, with all-cause mortality risk in the overall cohort, and stratified by pre-dialysis serum potassium (<5mEq/L vs. ‚â•5mEq/L) using case-mix adjusted Cox models.    Results  In baseline analyses, dialysate potassium concentrations of 1mEq/L were associated with higher mortality, whereas concentrations of 3mEq/L were associated with similar mortality in the overall cohort (reference: 2mEq/L): adjusted HRs (aHRs) (95% CI) 1.70 (1.01-2.88) and 0.95 (0.64-1.39), respectively. In analyses stratified by serum potassium, baseline dialysate potassium concentrations of 1mEq/L were associated with higher mortality in patients with serum potassium ‚â•5mEq/L but not in those with serum potassium <5mEq/L: aHRs (95% CI) 2.87 (1.51-5.46) and 0.74 (0.27-2.07), respectively (p-interaction=0.04). These findings were robust with incremental adjustment for serum potassium, potassium-binding resins, and potassium-modifying medications.    Conclusion  Low (1mEq/L) dialysate potassium concentrations were associated with higher mortality, particularly in hemodialysis patients with high pre-dialysis serum potassium.

When analyzing transcriptional regulation using AthaMap it may be important to learn which genes are also post-transcriptionally regulated by inhibitory RNAs. Therefore, a unified database for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation will be highly useful for the analysis of gene expression regulation. Methods To identify putative microRNA target sites in the genome of A. thaliana , processed mature miRNAs from 243 annotated miRNA genes were used for screening with the psRNATarget web server. Positional information, target genes and the psRNATarget score for each target site were annotated to the AthaMap database. Furthermore, putative target sites for small RNAs from seven small RNA transcriptome datasets were used to determine small RNA target sites within the A. thaliana genome. Results Putative 41,965 genome wide miRNA target sites and 10,442 miRNA target genes were identified in the A. thaliana genome. Taken together with genes targeted by small RNAs from small RNA transcriptome datasets, a total of 16,600 A. thaliana genes are putatively regulated by inhibitory RNAs.

0.229987131,27072370,"Polymorphism of Kynurenine Pathway-Related Genes, Kynurenic Acid, and Psychopathological Symptoms in HIV"," HIV-infection is associated with neuroinflammation and greater psychopathological symptoms, which may be mediated by imbalances in the kynurenic pathway (KP). Two key KP enzymes that catabolize kynurenine include kynurenine-aminotransferase II (KATII), which yields antioxidative kynurenine acid [KYNA] in astrocytes, and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO), which produces neurotoxic metabolites in microglia. The relationships between polymorphisms in KMO and KATII , psychopathological symptoms, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [KYNA] were evaluated in subjects with and without HIV-infection. Seventytwo HIV-positive and 72-seronegative (SN) participants were genotyped for KATII -rs1480544 and KMO -rs1053230. Although our participants were not currently diagnosed with depression or anxiety, they were assessed for psychopathological distress with Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. CSF-[KYNA] was also measured in 100 subjects (49 HIV/51 SN). HIV-participants had more psychopathological distress than SN, especially for anxiety. KATII -by-HIV interactions were found on anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity and obsessive compulsivity; KATII -C-carriers had lower scores than TT-carriers in SN but not in HIV. In contrast, the KMO -polymorphism had no influence on psychopathological symptoms in both groups. Overall, CSF-[KYNA] increased with age independently of HIV-serostatus, except KATII -TT-carriers tended to show no age-dependent variations. Therefore, the C-allele in KATII -rs1480544 appears to be protective against psychopathological distress in SN but not in HIV individuals, who had more psychopathological symptoms and likely greater neuroinflammation. The age-dependent increase in CSF-[KYNA] may reflect a compensatory response to age-related inflammation, which may be deficient in KATII -TT-carriers. Targeted treatments that decrease neuroinflammation and increase KYNA in at risk KATII -TT-carriers may reduce psychopathological symptoms in HIV.

Results A total of 1,011 patients qualified to participate in this Phase III study that included randomized controlled trials. Meta-analysis results showed that axitinib was more highly and significantly associated with a survival benefit in the independently assessed progression-free survival in comparison to sorafenib. The values of RR of the objective response rate and disease control rate were also significantly different. Results of the analysis of adverse events concerning hypertension and hypothyroidism demonstrated that the values of RR were significantly higher in the axitinib group and lower risks were established in the patients treated with axitinib. Conclusion Therefore, axitinib was a better treatment option for metastatic renal cell carcinoma treatment than sorafenib, especially after failure of prior systemic therapies. This analysis revealed that axitinib had higher risks of hypertension and hypothyroidism and lower risks of rash and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.",OncoTargets and therapy,ONCO
0.786883274,24961257,Forced Exercise Enhances Functional Recovery after Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats,"Caveolin is the principal protein of caveolae and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. To investigate whether changed expression of caveolins has a pivotal role in focal cerebral ischemia, we induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)-reperfusion and examined expression of caveolins, inflammatory activation markers, and mediators of autophagic cell death. We also treated MCAo rats with forced exercise to determine its effects on neurological outcome. Particularly, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used to compare the effects of hypertension on focal cerebral ischemia. All MCAo groups showed neurological deficiencies, motor dysfunction, and disruption of balancing ability; however, these pathological changes were more severe in SHR than WKY rats. Expression of caveolins was decreased in MCAo brain tissue, whereas the levels of iNOS and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) increased. Additionally, LC3-II and beclin-1 levels were elevated in the MCAo groups. Forced exercise attenuated both molecular and behavioral changes in MCAo animals, but SHR rats showed delayed functional recovery and residual molecular changes when compared to WKY rats. These results suggest that forced exercise may be beneficial for promoting functional recovery following cerebral ischemia through caveolin-dependent mechanisms or interactions between caveolins and these signaling molecules in ischemic brain regions.",Brain sciences,NEURO
0.643157219,19193517,Compressed and Distributed Sensing of Neuronal Activity for Real Time Spike Train Decoding," Multivariate point processes are increasingly being used to model neuronal response properties in the cortex. Estimating the conditional intensity functions underlying these processes is important to characterize and decode the firing patterns of cortical neurons. This paper proposes a new approach for estimating these intensity functions directly from a compressed representation of the neurons‚Äô extracellular recordings. The approach is based on exploiting a sparse representation of the extracellular spike waveforms, previously demonstrated to yield near-optimal denoising and compression properties. We show that by restricting this sparse representation to a subset of projections that simultaneously preserve features of the spike waveforms in addition to the temporal characteristics of the underlying intensity functions, we can reasonably approximate the instantaneous firing rates of the recorded neurons with variable tuning characteristics across a multitude of time scales. Such feature is highly desirable to detect subtle temporal differences in neuronal firing characteristics from single-trial data. An added advantage of this approach is that it eliminates multiple steps from the typical processing path of neural signals that are customarily performed for instantaneous neural decoding. We demonstrate the decoding performance of the approach using a stochastic cosine tuning model of motor cortical activity during a natural, nongoal-directed 2-D arm movement.

0.564558897,23569642,Overcoming Data Challenges Examining Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia,"Objective The objective of our study of oral health disparities in Appalachia was to use existing data sources to geographically analyze suspected disparities in oral health status in the 420 counties of Appalachia, and to make sub-state comparisons within Appalachia and to the rest of the nation. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the methods used to overcome challenges associated with using limited oral health data to make inferences about oral health status. Methods: Oral health data were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Because the BRFSS was designed for state-level analysis, there were inadequate numbers of responses to study Appalachia by county. We set out to determine the smallest possible unit we could use, aggregating data to satisfy CDC minimum requirements for spatially identified responses. For sub-state comparisons, data were first aggregated to Appalachian and non-Appalachian regions within Appalachian states. Next, urban versus rural areas within Appalachian and non-Appalachian regions were examined. Beale codes were used to define metropolitan and non-metropolitan statistical regions for the United States. Results: Aggregating the data as described proved useful for smoothing the data used to analyze oral health disparities, while still revealing important sub-state differences. Using geographic information systems to map data throughout the process was very useful for determining an effective approach for our analysis. Discussion: Studying oral health disparities on a regional or national level is difficult given a lack of appropriate data. The BRFSS can be adapted for this purpose; however, there is a limited number of oral health questions and because they are also optional, they are not routinely asked by all states. Expanding the BRFSS to include a larger sampling frame would be very helpful for studying oral health disparities. Conclusions: Novel techniques were introduced to use BRFSS data to study oral health disparities in Appalachia, which provided informative sub-state results, useful to health planners for targeting intervention strategies.",Online journal of public health informatics,CS
0.880041472,31552322,Numerical Slug Flow Model of Curved Pipes with Experimental Validation,"The research for gas‚Äìliquid two-phase flow is very important for flow assurance and flow stability of chemical transportation. In terms of transportation pipelines, the curved section is a very significant part. Therefore, the present work proposes a transient slug flow model for the curve pipes, and we conducted some experiments to validate it. This slug flow model is a four-equation model that contains mass and momentum balances with the closure relations. The normal two-dimensional rectangular coordinate system is simplified to the one-dimensional polar coordinate system, which will make the simulation faster and easier. The common flow parameters, such as the pressure profile along the pipeline, real-time pressure, and liquid holdup, are calculated in this model. Three groups of experiments with three different pipe curvatures were carried out to validate this model; the experiments were under the same conditions as those of the model calculations. The transient pressure and liquid holdup were measured at the middle of the curved pipe. The experimental data are compared to the calculated results, and there are error analyses of pressure and liquid holdup that are made to review the model‚Äôs performance. The analyses show that a large proportion of the pressure errors is within 10%, and most of the liquid holdup errors are within 0.1. The comparisons between the model and experiments show good agreement.",ACS omega,CHEM

The present study was designed to have an initial exploration of the correlation between the load and extent of aortic atheroma (AA) and initial stroke severity or clinical outcome 3‚Äâmonths after stroke. Methods : Cardiac-gated chest tomography (CGCT) was used to detect and measure AA in patients with acute ischemic stroke as shown by our group in prior prospective studies and this is part four sub-exploratory study of the same cohort. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess the initial stroke severity, and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to assess 3-month outcome. Results : Thirty-two patients underwent CGCT for evaluation of AA, and 21 were found to have AA. AA was more prevalent in patient with NIHSS >6 (14/17 versus 7/15, p -value 0.03). Applying the multiple logistic regression and propensity score adjustment (using the propensity of having AA given the baseline features as covariates) showed a non-significant trend that AA is three times more likely to be associated with NIHSS >6 ( p =‚Äâ0.08, OR 3.08, 95% CI 0.94‚Äì13.52). There was no evidence of association of AA with 3-month functional outcome (mRS): 11/14 (78.6%) mRS >1 had AA, and 10/18 (55.5%) of those with mRS ‚â§1 had AA ( p =‚Äâ0.27). Conclusion : In our current study with limited sample number and exploratory nature, the presence of AA on CGCT with acute ischemic stroke patients may be associated with worse neurological deficit at presentation.

Methods This study was an open‚Äêlabel crossover study. The CYP probe cocktail drugs caffeine, losartan, dextromethorphan, omeprazole, midazolam and fexofenadine were administered before and after 2 weeks of fermented red ginseng administration. Plasma samples were collected, and tolerability was assessed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated, and the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios of the parameters were determined from logarithmically transformed data. Values were compared between before and after fermented red ginseng administration using analysis of variance ( anova ). Results Fifteen healthy male subjects were evaluated, none of whom were genetically defined as a poor CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 metabolizer based on genotyping. Before and after fermented red ginseng administration, the geometric least‚Äêsquare mean metabolic ratio (90% CI) was 0.901 (0.830‚Äì0.979) for caffeine (CYP1A2) to paraxanthine, 0.774 (0.720‚Äì0.831) for losartan (CYP2C9) to EXP3174, 1.052 (0.925‚Äì1.197) for omeprazole (CYP2C19) to 5‚Äêhydroxyomeprazole, 1.150 (0.860‚Äì1.538) for dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) to dextrorphan, and 0.816 (0.673‚Äì0.990) for midazolam (CYP3A4) to 1‚Äêhydroxymidazolam. The geometric mean ratio of the area under the curve of the last sampling time (AUC last ) for fexofenadine (P‚Äêgp) was 1.322 (1.112‚Äì1.571).

0.276568809,28398591,Evolutionarily distinct strategies for the acquisition of inorganic carbon from seawater in marine diatoms,"The uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon by marine diatoms is facilitated by solute carrier transporters or external carbonic anhydrases. The occurrence of these distinct strategies is unrelated to phylogeny. Abstract The acquisition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in CO 2 -limited seawater is a central issue to understand in marine primary production. We previously demonstrated the occurrence of direct HCO 3 ‚Äì uptake by solute carrier (SLC) 4 transporters in a diatom, a major marine primary producer. Homologs of SLC are found in both centric and pennate marine diatoms, suggesting that SLC transporters are generally conserved. Here, the generality of SLC-mediated DIC uptake in diatoms was examined using an SLC inhibitor, diisothiocyano-2,2 π-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS), and an inhibitor of external carbonic anhydrase, acetazolamide. DIDS suppressed high-DIC-affinity photosynthesis in the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the centric diatom Chaetoceros muelleri , but there was no effect on either the pennate Cylindrotheca fusiformis or the centric Thalassiosira pseudonana . Interestingly, the DIC affinity of DIDS-insensitive strains was sensitive to treatment with up to 100 ŒºM acetazolamide, displaying a 2‚Äì4-fold increase in K 0.5 [DIC]. In contrast, acetazolamide did not affect the DIDS-sensitive group. These results indicate the occurrence of two distinct strategies for DIC uptake‚Äîone primarily facilitated by SLC and the other being passive CO 2 entry facilitated by external carbonic anhydrase. The phylogenetic independence of these strategies suggests that environmental demands drove the evolution of distinct DIC uptake mechanisms in diatoms.",Journal of experimental botany,ANIMAL
0.78042876,30079097,Physical Forces Determining the Persistency and Centering Precision of Microtubule Asters," In early embryos, microtubules form star-shaped aster structures that can measure up to hundreds of micrometres, and move at high speeds to find the geometrical centre of the cell. This process, known as aster centration, is essential for the fidelity of cell division and development, but how cells succeed in moving these large structures through their crowded and fluctuating cytoplasm remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the positional fluctuations of migrating sea urchin sperm asters are small, anisotropic, and associated with the stochasticity of dynein-dependent forces moving the aster. Using in vivo magnetic tweezers to directly measure aster forces inside cells, we derive a linear aster force-velocity relationship and provide evidence for a spring-like active mechanism stabilizing the transverse position of the asters. The large frictional coefficient and spring constant quantitatively account for the amplitude and growth characteristics of athermal positional fluctuations, demonstrating that aster mechanics ensure noise suppression to promote persistent and precise centration. These findings define generic biophysical regimes of active cytoskeletal mechanics underlying the accuracy of cell division and early embryonic development. ",Nature physics,ENG

We examined the potential impact of delayed blood centrifuging, choice of collection tube, and type of assay on 25(OH)D concentrations. Blood samples from 20 healthy volunteers underwent alternative laboratory procedures: four centrifuging times (2, 24, 72, and 96 h after blood draw); three types of collection tubes (red top serum tube, two different plasma anticoagulant tubes containing heparin or EDTA); and two types of assays (DiaSorin radioimmunoassay [RIA] and chemiluminescence immunoassay [CLIA/LIAISON¬Æ]). Log-transformed 25(OH)D concentrations were analyzed using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) linear regression models. We found no difference in 25(OH)D concentrations by centrifuging times or type of assay. There was some indication of a difference in 25(OH)D concentrations by tube type in CLIA/LIAISON¬Æ-assayed samples, with concentrations in heparinized plasma (geometric mean, 16.1 ng ml ‚àí1 ) higher than those in serum (geometric mean, 15.3 ng ml ‚àí1 ) ( p = 0.01), but the difference was significant only after substantial centrifuging delays (96 h).

0.692172124,20929590,Declining in efficacy of a three-day combination regimen of mefloquine-artesunate in a multi-drug resistance area along the Thai-Myanmar border,"Background Declining in clinical efficacy of artesunate-mefloquine combination has been documented in areas along the eastern border (Thai-Cambodian) of Thailand. In the present study, the clinical efficacy of the three-day combination regimen of artesunate-mefloquine as first-line treatment for acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Thailand was monitored in an area along the western border (Thai-Myanmar) of the country. Methods A total of 150 Burmese patients (85 males and 65 females) aged between 16 and 50 years who were attending the Mae Tao clinic, Mae-Sot, Tak Province, and presenting with symptomatic acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were included into the study. Patients were treated initially (day 0) with 4 mg/kg body weight artesunate and 15 mg/kg body weight mefloquine. The dose regimen on day 2 was 4 mg/kg body weight artesunate and 10 mg/kg body weight mefloquine. On day 3, artesunate at the dose of 4 mg/kg body weight was given with 0.6 mg/kg body weight primaquine. Whole blood mefloquine and plasma artesunate and dihydroartemisinin (active plasma metabolite of artesunate) concentrations following treatment were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS), respectively. Results Thirty-four cases had recrudescence during days 7 and 42. Five and 5 cases, respectively had reinfection with P. falciparum and reappearance of Plasmodium vivax in their peripheral blood during follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 42-and 28-day efficacy rates of this combination regimen were 72.58% (95% CI: 63.20-79.07%) and 83.06 (95% CI 76.14-94.40%), respectively. Parasite clearance time (PCT) and fever clearance time (FCT) were significantly prolonged in patients with treatment failure compared with those with sensitive response [median (95% CI) values for PCT 32.0 (20.0-48.0) vs 24.0 (14.0-32.0) hr and FCT 30.0 (22.0-42.0) vs 26.0 (18.0-36.0) hr; p < 0.005]. Whole blood mefloquine concentrations on days 1, 7 and 14 in patients with sensitive and recrudescence response were comparable. Although plasma concentration of dihydroartemisinin at 1 hour of treatment was significantly lower in patients with recrudescence compared with sensitive response [mean (95% CI) 456 (215-875) vs 525 (452-599) ng/ml; p < 0.001], the proportion of patients with recrudescence who had relatively low (compared with the lower limit of 95% CI defined in the sensitive group) was significantly smaller than that of the sensitive group. Conclusions Although pharmacokinetic (ethnic-related) factors including resistance of P. falciparum to mefloquine contribute to some treatment failure following treatment with a three-day combination regimen of artesunate-mefloquine, results suggest that artesunate resistance may be emerging at the Thai-Myanmar border.",Malaria journal,IMMUN
0.334278354,27974510,Modeling cell survival and change in amount of DNA during protracted irradiation,"Abstract Hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) is a well-known bioresponse under low-dose or low-dose-rate exposures. Although disorder of the DNA repair function, non-targeted effects and accumulation of cells in G 2 have been experimentally observed, the mechanism for inducing HRS by long-term irradiation is still unclear. On the basis of biological experiments and a theoretical study, we have shown that change in the amount of DNA associated with accumulation of cells in G 2 enhances radiosensitivity. To demonstrate continuous irradiation with 250 kVp X-rays, we adopted a fractionated regimen of 0.186 or 1.00 Gy per fraction at intervals of 1 h (i.e. 0.186 Gy/h, 1.00 Gy/h on average) to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)-K1 cells. The change in the amount of DNA during irradiation was quantified by flow cytometric analysis with propidium iodide (PI). Concurrently, we attempted a theoretical evaluation of the DNA damage by using a microdosimetric-kinetic (MK) model that was modified to incorporate the change in the amount of DNA. Our experimental results showed that the fraction of the cells in G 2 /M phase increased by 6.7% with 0.186 Gy/h and by 22.1% with 1.00 Gy/h after the 12th irradiation. The MK model considering the change in amount of DNA during the irradiation exhibited a higher radiosensitivity at a high dose range, which could account for the experimental clonogenic survival. The theoretical results suggest that HRS in the high dose range is associated with an increase in the total amount of DNA during irradiation.",Journal of radiation research,IMMUN

Subjects with MCI (n =3,187) and normal cognition (n=3,244) were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. TBI was categorized based on lifetime reported TBI with loss of consciousness (LOC) without chronic deficit. Logistic regression was used to examine TBI history as a predictor of MCI, adjusted for demographics, apolipoprotein E-e4 (Apoe4), a composite vascular risk score, and history of psychiatric factors. ANCOVA was used to examine whether age at MCI diagnosis and estimated age of onset differed between those with (TBI+) and without (TBI-) a history of TBI. TBI history was a significant predictor (p<.01) and associated with increased odds of MCI diagnosis in unadjusted (OR=1.25; 95% CI =1.05 ‚Äì 1.49) and adjusted models, accounting for age, education, Apoe4, and a composite vascular score (OR=1.32; 95% CI=1.10 ‚Äì 1.58). This association, however, was largely attenuated (OR=1.14; 95% CI=0.94 ‚Äì 1.37; p =.18) after adjustment for reported history of depression. MCI was diagnosed a mean of 2.3 years earlier (p<.001) in the TBI+ group, and although TBI+ subjects had an estimated mean of decline 1.7 years earlier, clinician-estimated age of onset failed to differ (p =.13) when sex and psychiatric factors were controlled. This is the first report of a possible role for TBI as a risk factor in MCI, but its association may be related to other factors such as sex and depression and requires further investigation.

0.667518231,26745411,Direct Calculation of Protein Fitness Landscapes through Computational Protein Design," Naturally selected amino-acid sequences or experimentally derived ones are often the basis for understanding how protein three-dimensional conformation and function are determined by primary structure. Such sequences for a protein family comprise only a small fraction of all possible variants, however, representing the fitness landscape with limited scope. Explicitly sampling and characterizing alternative, unexplored protein sequences would directly identify fundamental reasons for sequence robustness (or variability), and we demonstrate that computational methods offer an efficient mechanism toward this end, on a large scale. The dead-end elimination and A* search algorithms were used here to find all low-energy single mutant variants, and corresponding structures of a G-protein heterotrimer, to measure changes in structural stability and binding interactions to define a protein fitness landscape. We established consistency between these algorithms with known biophysical and evolutionary trends for amino-acid substitutions, and could thus recapitulate known protein side-chain interactions and predict novel ones.

0.661211377,15128600,"Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Regulates Expression of the DNA Damage Repair Gene,  Fanconi anemia A , in Pituitary Gonadotroph Cells 1"," Gonadal function is critically dependant on regulated secretion of the gonadotropin hormones from anterior pituitary gonadotroph cells. Gonadotropin biosynthesis and release is triggered by the binding of hypothalamic GnRH to GnRH receptor expressed on the gonadotroph cell surface. The repertoire of regulatory molecules involved in this process are still being defined. We used the mouse LŒ≤T2 gonadotroph cell line, which expresses both gonadotropin hormones, as a model to investigate GnRH regulation of gene expression and differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify and isolate hormonally induced changes. This approach identified Fanconi anemia a ( Fanca ), a gene implicated in DNA damage repair, as a differentially expressed transcript. Mutations in Fanca account for the majority of cases of Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessively inherited disease identified by congenital defects, bone marrow failure, infertility, and cancer susceptibility. We confirmed expression and hormonal regulation of Fanca mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR, which showed that GnRH induced a rapid, transient increase in Fanca mRNA. Fanca protein was also acutely upregulated after GnRH treatment of LŒ≤T2 cells. In addition, Fanca gene expression was confined to mature pituitary gonadotrophs and adult mouse pituitary and was not expressed in the immature Œ±T3-1 gonadotroph cell line. Thus, this study extends the expression profile of Fanca into a highly specialized endocrine cell and demonstrates hormonal regulation of expression of the Fanca locus. We suggest that this regulatory mechanism may have a crucial role in the GnRH-response mechanism of mature gonadotrophs and perhaps the etiology of FA. ",Biology of reproduction,BIOCHEM

This ability has been linked to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). To investigate how information is encoded and transmitted through this circuit, we performed electrophysiological recordings in mice observing a demonstrator mouse undergo associative fear conditioning, and found that BLA-projecting ACC (ACC‚ÜíBLA) neurons preferentially encode socially-derived aversive cue information. Inhibition of ACC‚ÜíBLA alters real-time amygdala representation of the aversive cue during observational conditioning. Selective inhibition of the ACC‚ÜíBLA projection impaired acquisition, but not expression, of observational fear conditioning. Together, we show that information derived from observation about the aversive value of the cue is transmitted from the ACC to the BLA and that this routing of information is critically instructive for observational fear conditioning.   In Brief  For one individual to watch another‚Äôs experience and learn from it, signals need to move from cortical neurons to the basolateral amygdala during detection and integration of the necessary social cues.

The short-term and long-term benefits of lowering Cd exposure are unknown because of its long half-life in the body.    Objectives:  We aimed to investigate whether an intervention with low-Cd rice in a contaminated area of China reduced urinary Cd (UCd) levels and improved blood pressure and kidney function outcomes compared to no-intervention in consumers of high-Cd rice in the same region.    Methods:  106 non-smoking subjects were divided into three treatment groups: the intervention group (replacing homegrown high-Cd rice with market low-Cd rice, n =34), the non-intervention group (continue eating high-Cd rice, n =36) and the control group (continued eating low-Cd rice they have been eating for years, n =36). The intervention period lasted for almost 8 months, during which participants were visited on up to 4 occasions and UCd, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), kidney function biomarkers (Œ≤2-microglobulin and N -Sacetyl-Œ≤-D-glucosaminidase) were measured.    Results:  After 3 months, the geometric mean UCd in the intervention (Int) group decreased significantly by 0.32 Œºg/g ( p =0.007), while changes were not significant in the non-intervention (non-Int) group (0.13 Œºg/g, p =0.95) or the control group (‚àí0.01 Œºg/g, p =0.52). UCd in the Int group remained lower than in the non-Int group but higher than in the Control group through the end of follow up. DBP in the Int group decreased significantly from 80 mm Hg at month three ( p = 0.03) and stayed around 74 mm Hg for the remainder of the study. SBP also decreased in the Int group but with variations similar to those observed in the other two groups. The two kidney biomarkers showed variations without a clear pattern.    Conclusion:  This study suggested that UCd reflected both short-term (< 3 months) and long-term Cd exposure. In addition, the low-Cd rice intervention showed initial benefits in lowering blood pressure levels, especially DBP, but not kidney biomarkers.  ",Environment international,ENVIRON

We measured change in amyloid deposition over time using serial 11 C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography and progression of neurodegeneration using serial structural magnetic resonance imaging. We studied 21 healthy cognitively normal subjects, 32 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 8 with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were drawn from two sources‚Äîongoing longitudinal registries at Mayo Clinic, and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). All subjects underwent clinical assessments, MRI and PIB studies at two time points, approximately one year apart. PIB retention was quantified in global cortical to cerebellar ratio units and brain atrophy in units of cm 3 by measuring ventricular expansion. The annual change in global PIB retention did not differ by clinical group ( P =‚Äâ0.90), and although small (median 0.042 ratio units/year overall) was greater than zero among all subjects ( P <‚Äâ0.001). Ventricular expansion rates differed by clinical group ( P <‚Äâ0.001) and increased in the following order: cognitively normal (1.3‚Äâcm 3 /year) <‚Äâ‚Äâamnestic mild cognitive impairment (2.5 cm 3 /year) <‚Äâ‚ÄâAlzheimer's disease (7.7 cm 3 /year). Among all subjects there was no correlation between PIB change and concurrent change on CDR-SB ( r =‚Äâ‚àí0.01, P =‚Äâ0.97) but some evidence of a weak correlation with MMSE ( r =‚àí0.22, P =‚Äâ0.09). In contrast, greater rates of ventricular expansion were clearly correlated with worsening concurrent change on CDR-SB ( r =‚Äâ0.42, P <‚Äâ0.01) and MMSE ( r =‚àí0.52, P <‚Äâ0.01). Our data are consistent with a model of typical late onset Alzheimer's disease that has two main features: (i) dissociation between the rate of amyloid deposition and the rate of neurodegeneration late in life, with amyloid deposition proceeding at a constant slow rate while neurodegeneration accelerates and (ii) clinical symptoms are coupled to neurodegeneration not amyloid deposition. Significant plaque deposition occurs prior to clinical decline. The presence of brain amyloidosis alone is not sufficient to produce cognitive decline, rather, the neurodegenerative component of Alzheimer's disease pathology is the direct substrate of cognitive impairment and the rate of cognitive decline is driven by the rate of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration (atrophy on MRI) both precedes and parallels cognitive decline. This model implies a complimentary role for MRI and PIB imaging in Alzheimer's disease, with each reflecting one of the major pathologies, amyloid dysmetabolism and neurodegeneration.",Brain : a journal of neurology,NEURO

However, the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears is controversial. Investigation of cuff tears is based on ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both modalities have been in use for decades, and their advantages and limitations are known. A recent Cochrane review of the subject suggested that US and MRI both performed well with respect to full thickness rotator cuff tears (FTT). However, they were less accurate with respect to partial thickness tears (PTT). The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of US and MRI in diagnosing rotator cuff tears. Material/Methods This is a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 255 patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy. Of them, 125 patients had preoperative US, and 130 had preoperative MRI. The imaging results were compared with arthroscopic findings for patient. Results After calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value (PPV), and negative prediction value, we found no statistically significant difference between US and MRI in detection of rotator cuff tears of any type (RCT) or FTT. However, US is more specific in detecting PTT compared to MRI (P=0.00008) but with no significant difference in other parameters. Conclusions We concluded that US and MRI both have similar accuracy in diagnosing RCT of any sort and FTT. However, US is more specific than MRI in detecting PTT. In our institute, we now recommend US as the investigation of choice for diagnosing rotator cuff tears.",Polish journal of radiology,CLINIC
0.19212929,30787397,Microbial residence time is a controlling parameter of the taxonomic composition and functional profile of microbial communities," A remaining challenge within microbial ecology is to understand the determinants of richness and diversity observed in environmental microbial communities. In a range of systems, including activated sludge bioreactors, the microbial residence time (MRT) has been previously shown to shape the microbial community composition. However, the physiological and ecological mechanisms driving this influence have remained unclear. Here, this relationship is explored by analyzing an activated sludge system fed with municipal wastewater. Using a model designed in this study based on Monod-growth kinetics, longer MRTs were shown to increase the range of growth parameters that enable persistence, resulting in increased richness and diversity in the modelled community. In laboratory experiments, six sequencing batch reactors treating domestic wastewater were operated in parallel at MRTs between 1-15 d. The communities were characterized using both 16S ribosomal RNA and non-target messenger RNA sequencing (metatranscriptomic analysis), and model-predicted monotonic increases in richness were confirmed in both profiles. Accordingly, taxonomic Shannon diversity also increased with MRT. In contrast, the diversity in enzyme class annotations resulting from the metatranscriptomic analysis displayed a non-monotonic trend over the MRT gradient. Disproportionately high abundances of transcripts encoding for rarer enzymes occur at longer MRTs and contribute to the disconnect between taxonomic and functional diversity profiles.

Purpose To report the prevalence of patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tubercular spondylodiscitis and their outcomes. Additionally, to assess the role of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in early detection of MDR tuberculosis. Overview of Literature MDR tuberculosis is increasing globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) has strongly recommended Xpert MTB/RIF assay for early detection of tuberculosis. Methods From 2006 to 2015, a retrospective study was conducted on patients treated for MDR tuberculosis of the spine. Only patients whose diagnosis was confirmed using either culture and/or the Xpert MTB/RIF assay were included. Diagnostic method, treatment regimen, time taken to initiate second-line antituberculosis treatment (ATT), drug-related complications, and cost of medications were analyzed. All patients with MDR were treated according to the WHO recommendations for 2 years. The outcome parameters analyzed included clinical, biochemical, and radiological criteria to assess healing status. Results From 2006 to 2015, a total of 730 patients were treated for tubercular spondylodiscitis. Of those, 36 had MDR tubercular spondylitis (prevalence, 4.9%), and three had extremely drug resistant tubercular spondylitis (prevalence, 0.4%). In this study, 30 patients, with a mean age of 29 years and a mean post-treatment follow-up of 24 months, were enrolled. The majority (77%) had secondary MDR, 17 (56%) underwent surgery, and 26 (87%) completed treatment for 2 years and were healed. Drug-related complications (33%) included ototoxicity, hypothyroidism, and hyperpigmentation of the skin. The average time taken for initiation of second line ATT for MDR patients with Xpert MTB/RIF assay as the diagnostic tool was 18 days, when compared to patients for whom the assay was not available which was 243 days. Conclusions The prevalence of MDR tubercular spondylodiscitis was 4.9%. In total, 87% of patients were healed with adequate treatment. The sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay to detect MDR was 100% and 92.3%, respectively.",Asian spine journal,CLINIC
0.646585801,27214911,A 5nW Quasi-linear CMOS Hot-electron Injector for Self-powered Monitoring of Biomechanical Strain Variations," Piezoelectricity-driven hot-electron injectors (p-HEI) are used for self-powered monitoring of mechanical activity in biomechanical implants and structures. Previously reported p-HEI devices operate by harvesting energy from a piezoelectric transducer to generate current and voltage references which are then used for initiating and controlling the process of hot-electron injection. As a result, the minimum energy required to activate the device is limited by the power requirements of the reference circuits. In this paper we present a p-HEI device that operates by directly exploiting the self-limiting capability of an energy transducer when driving the process of hot-electron injection in a pMOS floating-gate transistor. As a result, the p-HEI device can activate itself at input power levels less than 5 nW. Using a prototype fabricated in a 0.5- Œº m bulk CMOS process we validate the functionality of the proposed injector and show that for a fixed input power, its dynamics is quasi-linear with respect to time. The paper also presents measurement results using a cadaver phantom where the fabricated p-HEI device has been integrated with a piezoelectric transducer and is used for self-powered monitoring of mechanical activity.

Nicotine, the major active ingredient of e-cigarettes and tobacco smoke, induces acute vasomotor effects that may temporarily increase arterial stiffness. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term nicotine exposure on structural aortic stiffness. Methods: Mice (C57BL/6) were infused with nicotine for 40 days (20 mg/kg/day). Arterial stiffness of the thoracic (TS) and abdominal (AS) aortic segments was analyzed using ultrasound (PWV, pulse wave velocity) and ex vivo pressure myograph measurements. For mechanistic studies, aortic matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and activity as well as medial elastin architecture were analyzed. Results: Global aortic stiffness increased with nicotine. In particular, local stiffening of the abdominal segment occurred after 10 days, while thoracic aortic stiffness was only increased after 40 days, resulting in aortic stiffness segmentation. Mechanistically, nicotine exposure enhanced expression of MMP-2/-9 and elastolytic activity in both aortic segments. Elastin degradation occurred in both segments; however, basal elastin levels were higher in the thoracic aorta. Finally, MMP-inhibition significantly reduced nicotine-induced MMP activity, elastin destruction, and aortic stiffening. Conclusion: Chronic nicotine exposure induces aortic MMP expression and structural aortic damage (elastin fragmentation), irreversibly increasing aortic stiffness. This process predominantly affects the abdominal aortic segment, presumably due in part to a lower basal elastin content. This novel phenomenon may help to explain the role of nicotine as a major risk factor for AAA formation and has health implications for ECIGs and other modes of nicotine delivery.",Frontiers in physiology,PHYSIO

At 3 hr and 24 hr after colchicine treatment, numerous coarse dots containing ALP were observed throughout the cytoplasm, and some of these showed colocalization with CAPD. At 48 hr and 72 hr after colchicine treatment, although most of the dots containing ALP in the cytoplasm disappeared, dots containing CAPD remained. The present results suggest that the denatured ALP proteins remaining in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes during cell restoration after colchicine treatment are digested by lysosomes.",Acta histochemica et cytochemica,BIOCHEM

This paper demonstrates acoustic emission (AE) sensing as a method of monitoring the flow of powder feedstock in a powder fed DED process. With minimal calibration, this signal closely correlates to the actual mass flow rate. This article describes the fabricated mass flow monitoring system, documents various conditions in which the actual flow rate deviates from its set value, and details situations that highlight the system‚Äôs utility. While AE mass flow monitoring is not free of concerns, its features make it an attractive measurement technique in the powder-fed DED process. The work presented here highlights the results obtained and illustrates that accurate monitoring of powder flow in real-time regardless of environmental conditions within the build chamber is possible.

0.367243248,22609851,"The Organochlorine  o,p‚Äô -DDT Plays a Role in Coactivator-Mediated MAPK Crosstalk in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells","Background: The organochlorine dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a known estrogen mimic and endocrine disruptor, has been linked to animal and human disorders. However, the detailed mechanism(s) by which DDT affects cellular physiology remains incompletely defined. Objectives: We and others have shown that DDT activates cell-signaling cascades, culminating in the activation of estrogen receptor-dependent and -independent gene expression. Here, we identify a mechanism by which DDT alters cellular signaling and gene expression, independent of the estrogen receptor. Methods: We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction array analysis of gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using either estradiol (E 2 ) or o,p ¬¥-DDT to identify distinct cellular gene expression responses. To elucidate the mechanisms by which DDT regulates cell signaling, we used molecular and pharmacological techniques. Results: E 2 and DDT treatment both altered the expression of many of the genes assayed, but up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGFA ) was observed only after DDT treatment, and this increase was not affected by the pure estrogen receptor Œ± antagonist ICI 182780. Furthermore, DDT increased activation of the HIF-1 response element (HRE), a known enhancer of the VEGFA gene. This DDT-mediated increase in HRE activity was augmented by the coactivator CBP (CREB-binding protein) and was dependent on the p38 pathway. Conclusions: DDT up-regulated the expression of several genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that were not altered by treatment with E 2 , including VEGFA . We propose that this DDT-initiated, ER-independent stimulation of gene expression is due to DDT‚Äôs ability to initiate crosstalk between MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways and transcriptional coactivators.",Environmental health perspectives,BIOCHEM

Methods  Expert surveys, logistic regression, and conjoint analysis were used to develop 287 definitions using core set measures (CSM). Myositis experts rated greater improvement among multiple pair-wise scenarios in conjoint analysis surveys, where different levels of improvement in two CSM were presented. The PAPRIKA (Potentially All Pairwise Rankings of All Possible Alternatives) method determined relative weights of CSM and conjoint analysis definitions. Performance characteristics of definitions were evaluated on patient profiles using expert consensus (gold standard) and were validated using a clinical trial. Nominal group technique was used for consensus.    Results  Consensus was reached for a conjoint analysis‚Äìbased continuous model using absolute percentage change in CSMs (physician, patient, and extra-muscular global activity, muscle strength, health assessment questionnaire and muscle enzymes).

The depth of invasion was remeasured and classified into 6 groups according to their wall penetration. The prediction model was founded based on the independent risk factors. The results shows that lymph node metastasis of m1, m2, m3, sm1, sm2, and sm3 of superficial esophageal carcinoma was 0%, 0%, 5.3%, 8.7%, 17.6%, and 37.5%, respectively. The tumor size, differentiation, and lymphvascular invasion were also significantly related to lymph node metastasis by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that the depth of invasion and lymphovascular invasion were independent risk factors of lymph node metastasis. A prediction model for lymph node metastasis was established as follows: p = e  x /(1 + e  x ), and x = ‚àí5.469 + 0.839 √ó depth of invasion + 1.992 √ó lymphavascular metastasis.

The predictive factors and timing of relapse in patients with U-MRD and value of interim MRD analysis are ill-defined. This was a prospective study of 289 patients with CLL treated first-line with FCR. MRD analysis was performed after course 3 (C3) and at end-of-therapy (EOT) in bone marrow using 4-color flow cytometry (sensitivity 10 ‚àí4 ). Eighteen percent of patients had U-MRD after C3 and 48% at EOT. U-MRD status at EOT was associated with longer PFS (median NR vs 38mo, p<0.001). MRD level (‚â§1% vs. >1%) after C3 predicted greater likelihood of U-MRD status at EOT (64% vs. 9%, p<0.001).

0.95686227,24996653,"Comprehensive analysis of cystatin family genes suggests their putative functions in sexual reproduction, embryogenesis, and seed formation","Summary The survey of expression patterns, biochemical characters, and intracellular localizations of cystatins in tobacco reveals their widespread roles in gamete development, embryogenesis, and seed formation. Cystatins are tightly bound and reversible inhibitors of cysteine proteases in C1A and C13 peptidase families, which have been identified in several species and shown to function in vegetative development and response to biotic/abiotic stresses in plants. Recent work revealed their critical role in regulating programmed cell death during embryogenesis in tobacco and suggested their more comprehensive roles in the process of sexual plant reproduction, although little is known about cystatin family genes in the processes. Here, 10 cystatin family genes in Nicotiana tabacum were identified using an expressed sequence tag (EST)-based gene clone strategy. Analysis of their biochemical properties showed that nine of them have the potency to inhibit the activities of both commercial cathepsin L-like proteases and extracted cysteine proteases from seeds, but with different K  i values depending on the types of proteases and the developmental stages of the seed tested. This suggests that cystatin-dependent cathepsin L-like proteolytic pathways are probably important for early seed development. Comprehensive expression profile analysis revealed that cystatin family genes showed manifold variations in their transcription levels in different plant cell types, including the sperm, egg, and zygote, especially in the embryo and seed at different developmental stages. More interestingly, intracellular localization analysis of each cystatin revealed that most members of cystatin families are recognized as secretory proteins with signal peptides that direct them to the endoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest their widespread roles in cell fate determination and cell‚Äìcell communication in the process of sexual reproduction, especially in gamete and embryo development, as well as in seed formation.",Journal of experimental botany,ANIMAL
0.197731291,21112161,Analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine in the presence of high levels of SDF-1Œ±/CXCL12 in the brain," Although morphine is often the best option for treating acute and chronic severe pain, its analgesic activity can be blocked in situations in which there are elevated levels of chemokines. Indeed, recently we have shown that elevated brain levels of the chemokine stromal cell-derived growth factor-1alpha (SDF-1Œ±/CXCL12, the ligand of the HIV co-receptor CXCR4) diminish the antinociceptive effect of morphine. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether such an effect is restricted to morphine or extends to other opioid medications such as buprenorphine. A sterilized stainless-steel C313G guide cannula was implanted into the periaqueductal grey (PAG), a brain region critical to the processing of pain signals, and a primary site of action of many analgesic compounds. The cold-water (‚àí3 ¬∞C) tail-flick test (CWT) was used to measure antinociception. Rats were pretreated with SDF-1Œ±/CXCL12 administered into the PAG, and the antinociceptive actions of buprenorphine were measured. Direct infusion of SDF-1Œ±/CXCL12 into the PAG failed to alter the antinociceptive action of buprenorphine. The presence of SDF-1Œ±/CXCL12 in the PAG differentially alters the antinociceptive function of opioid medications. While it was able to diminish the antinociception induced by morphine ( Adler et al., 2006 ), SDF-1Œ±/CXCL12 did not affect the buprenorphine-induced antinociception. Buprenorphine appears to be more effective in the presence of high levels of SDF-1Œ±/CXCL12 in the brain (which frequently occurs during neuroinflammatory conditions).

Although disease-modifying, they also have significant adverse effects. Understanding factors associated with GC use may help minimise exposure. The aims of the present study were to describe oral GC use in RA; determine any change in use over time; and determine factors associated with oral GC use, commencement or cessation. Methods Adult patients with RA were identified in the Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD), a national Australian registry that collects long-term outcome data from patients with inflammatory arthritis. Patients were categorised by their ARAD date of entry (DOE), with population-averaged logistic regression and transition state analysis used to determine any change in GC use over time. Fixed-effects panel regression was used to examine whether GC current use was associated with pain/arthritis activity/Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores or medication use. Transition state analysis was used to assess whether these factors influenced the commencement or cessation of GCs. Results A total of 3699 patients with RA completed a baseline ARAD questionnaire (73% female, mean age 57¬†years). The probability of GC use decreased over time according to ARAD DOE: September 2001 to March 2005, 55% (95% CI 52‚Äì58%); March 2005 to September 2008, 47% (45‚Äì49%); September 2008 to March 2012, 42% (39‚Äì45%); and March 2012 to October 2015, 39% (34‚Äì43%) ( p <‚Äâ0.001). Conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (OR 10.13; 95% CI 8.22‚Äì12.47), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (1.18; 1.02‚Äì1.37) and opioids (2.14; 1.84‚Äì2.48) were associated with GC current use, as were lower pain scores (0.94; 0.90‚Äì0.98), higher arthritis activity scores (1.09; 1.05‚Äì1.14) and poorer HAQ scores (1.52; 1.30‚Äì1.79). Use of biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) was not associated with GC current use (0.98; 0.83‚Äì1.15) or GC cessation (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.75‚Äì1.01), but it was associated with GC commencement (0.54; 0.47‚Äì0.62).

Design Three arm parallel cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting Eight UK secondary schools. Participants Adolescents (n=5030) aged 12-16 years in school year groups 8-11. Year groups were randomly assigned on a 1:1:1 ratio to cognitive behavioural therapy, attention control, or usual school provision. Allocation was balanced by school, year, number of students and classes, frequency of lessons, and timetabling. Participants were not blinded to treatment allocation. Interventions Cognitive behavioural therapy, attention control, and usual school provision provided in classes to all eligible participants. Main outcome measures Outcomes were collected by self completed questionnaire administered by researchers. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression assessed at 12 months by the short mood and feelings questionnaire among those identified at baseline as being at high risk of depression. Secondary outcomes included negative thinking, self worth, and anxiety. Analyses were undertaken on an intention to treat basis and accounted for the clustered nature of the design. Results 1064 (21.2%) adolescents were identified at high risk of depression: 392 in the classroom based cognitive behavioural therapy arm, 374 in the attention control arm, and 298 in the usual school provision arm. At 12 months adjusted mean scores on the short mood and feelings questionnaire did not differ for cognitive behavioural therapy versus attention control (‚àí0.63, 95% confidence interval ‚àí1.85 to 0.58, P=0.41) or for cognitive behavioural therapy versus usual school provision (0.97, ‚àí0.20 to 2.15, P=0.12).

Results: C-reactive protein was the most significant predictor of overall survival (OS; œá 2 =50.9, P <0.001). Five-year OS for patients with CRP‚©Ω15‚Äâmg‚Äâl ‚àí1  vs >15‚Äâmg‚Äâl ‚àí1 was 72% (95% CI 65‚Äì78%) and 33% (95% CI 23‚Äì44%), respectively. Similar results were seen for cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival. On multivariate analysis, CRP remained highly significant for CSS ( œá 2 =17.3, P <0.0001) and OS ( œá 2 =9.8, P <0.002), in addition to other pre-operative variables including log of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, red blood cell count and white cell count. C-reactive protein was significant in addition to the pre-operative nomogram score ( œá 2 =12.5, P =0.0004 for OS, œá 2 =16.2, P =0.0001 for CSS and œá 2 =8.6, P =0.003 for DFS) and was still significant when other pre-operative variables were included. Conclusion: C-reactive protein and other haematological and biochemical variables have independent prognostic significance in RCC and may enhance pre-operative scoring systems.",British journal of cancer,ONCO

We have employed four different methods, based on five different crystal structures: first, we docked the ligands to the proteins with induced-fit docking with the Glide software and calculated binding affinities with three energy functions. Second, the docked structures were minimised in a continuum solvent and binding affinities were calculated with the MM/GBSA method (molecular mechanics combined with generalised Born and solvent-accessible surface area solvation). Third, the docked structures were re-optimised by combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. Then, interaction energies were calculated with quantum mechanical calculations employing 970‚Äì1160 atoms in a continuum solvent, combined with energy corrections for dispersion, zero-point energy and entropy, ligand distortion, ligand solvation, and an increase of the basis set to quadruple-zeta quality. Fourth, relative binding affinities were estimated by free-energy simulations, using the multi-state Bennett acceptance-ratio approach. Unfortunately, the results were varying and rather poor, with only one calculation giving a correlation to the experimental affinities larger than 0.7, and with no consistent difference in the quality of the predictions from the various methods. For one set of ligands, the results could be strongly improved (after experimental data were revealed) if it was recognised that one of the ligands displaced one or two water molecules. For the other two sets, the problem is probably that the ligands bind in different modes than in the crystal structures employed or that the conformation of the ligand-binding site or the whole protein changes.

0.568569784,21748754,Chromosomes 4 and 8 Implicated in a Genome Wide SNP Linkage Scan of 762 Prostate Cancer Families Collected by the ICPCG,"  Background  In spite of intensive efforts, understanding of the genetic aspects of familial prostate cancer remains largely incomplete. In a previous microsatellite-based linkage scan of 1233 prostate cancer (PC) families, we identified suggestive evidence for linkage (i.e. LOD‚â•1.86) at 5q12, 15q11, 17q21, 22q12, and two loci on 8p, with additional regions implicated in subsets of families defined by age at diagnosis, disease aggressiveness, or number of affected members.    Methods  In an attempt to replicate these findings and increase linkage resolution, we used the Illumina 6000 SNP linkage panel to perform a genome-wide linkage scan of an independent set of 762 multiplex PC families, collected by 11 ICPCG groups.    Results  Of the regions identified previously, modest evidence of replication was observed only on the short arm of chromosome 8, where HLOD scores of 1.63 and 3.60 were observed in the complete set of families and families with young average age at diagnosis, respectively. The most significant linkage signals found in the complete set of families were observed across a broad, 37 cM interval on 4q13-25, with LOD scores ranging from 2.02 to 2.62, increasing to 4.50 in families with older average age at diagnosis. In families with multiple cases presenting with more aggressive disease, LOD scores over 3.0 were observed at 8q24 in the vicinity of previously identified common PC risk variants, as well as MYC , an important gene in PC biology.    Conclusions  These results will be useful in prioritizing future susceptibility gene discovery efforts in this common cancer.  ",The Prostate,POPGENE

Material and methods Standard primary chondrocyte cultures were prepared using osteochondral tissues that were surgically obtained from 6 patients with gonarthrosis. Cell morphology was evaluated using an inverted microscope, and cell death and proliferation were determined through MTT analysis, which was confirmed by AO/PI staining and statistically evaluated. The expression levels of CHAD , COL2A1 , and HIF-1 Œ± genes were assessed using gene-specific TaqMan Gene Expression Assays. Results MTT analyses showed that PGB administration did not have a negative or toxic effect on cell viability and proliferation in cultured chondrocytes ( p < 0.001), but in our morphological evaluation extracellular matrix development was observed to be weaker in cultures treated with PGB. After 24 h of treatment, COL2A1, HIF-1Œ±, and CHAD gene expression decreased in the groups to which PGB was applied compared to gene expression before the experiment (at 0 h); at 48 h, CHAD and HIF-1Œ± expression increased to the same level as the control group, but the expression of COL2A1 continued to decrease. Conclusions Further studies need to be conducted with more participants to prove that there is a negative correlation between extracellular matrix formation and PGB administration. Our preliminary data show that even at low doses and over short-term administration, PGB may affect chondrocyte cells at the gene-expression level.",Archives of medical science : AMS,BIOCHEM

Design  A cross-sectional analysis using 2 online, national research panel surveys.    Setting  United States.    Participants  A total of 7796 adults (18+ years).    Measures  Sodium-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.    Analysis  Data were weighted to match the US population survey proportions using 9 factors. Wald œá 2 tests were used to examine differences by survey year and hypertensive status.    Results  Despite the lack of temporal changes observed in respondent characteristics (mean age: 46 years, 67% were non-Hispanic white, and 26% reported hypertension), some changes were found in the prevalence of sodium-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. The percentage of respondents who recognized processed foods as the major source of sodium increased from 54% in 2012 to 57% in 2015 ( P = .04), as did the percentage of respondents who buy or choose low/reduced sodium foods, from 33% in 2012 to 37% in 2015 ( P = .016). In contrast, the percentage of self-reported receipt of health professional advice among persons with hypertension decreased from 59% in 2012 to 45% in 2015 ( P < .0001). Other sodium-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors did not change significantly during 2012 to 2015.    Conclusion  In recent years, some positive changes were observed in sodium-related knowledge and behaviors; however, the decrease in reported health professional advice to reduce sodium among respondents with hypertension is a concern.

0.954522656,24194840,Energetic Consequences of Human Sociality: Walking Speed Choices among Friendly Dyads,"Research has shown that individuals have an optimal walking speed‚Äìa speed which minimizes energy expenditure for a given distance. Because the optimal walking speed varies with mass and lower limb length, it also varies with sex, with males in any given population tending to have faster optimal walking speeds. This potentially creates an energetic dilemma for mixed-sex walking groups. Here we examine speed choices made by individuals of varying stature, mass, and sex walking together. Individuals (N‚Ää=‚Ää22) walked around a track alone, with a significant other (with and without holding hands), and with friends of the same and opposite sex while their speeds were recorded every 100 m. Our findings show that males walk at a significantly slower pace to match the females‚Äô paces (p‚Ää=‚Ää0.009), when the female is their romantic partner. The paces of friends of either same or mixed sex walking together did not significantly change (p>0.05). Thus significant pace adjustment appears to be limited to romantic partners. These findings have implications for both mobility and reproductive strategies of groups. Because the male carries the energetic burden by adjusting his pace (slowing down 7%), the female is spared the potentially increased caloric cost required to walk together. In energetically demanding environments, we will expect to find gender segregation in group composition, particularly when travelling longer distances.",PloS one,PSYCH
0.126973013,26387756,CD93 marks a non-quiescent human leukemia stem cell population and is required for development of MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia," SUMMARY  Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are thought to share several properties with hematopoietic stem cells, including cell cycle quiescence and a capacity for self-renewal. These features are hypothesized to underlie leukemic initiation, progression, and relapse, and also complicate efforts to eradicate leukemia through therapeutic targeting of LSCs without adverse effects on HSCs. Here, we show that acute myeloid leukemias with genomic rearrangements of the MLL gene contain a non-quiescent LSC population. Although human CD34+CD38‚àí LSCs are generally highly quiescent, the C-type lectin CD93 is expressed on a subset of actively cycling, non-quiescent AML cells enriched for LSC activity. CD93 expression is functionally required for engraftment of primary human AML LSCs and leukemogenesis, and regulates LSC self-renewal predominantly by silencing CDKN2B, a major tumor suppressor in AML. Thus, CD93 expression identifies a predominantly cycling, non-quiescent leukemia-initiating cell population in MLL-rearranged AML, providing opportunities for selective targeting and eradication of LSCs.

0.424347889,28991921,The impact of nutritional supplement intake on diet behavior and obesity outcomes,"After decades-old efforts to nudge consumers towards healthier lifestyles through dietary guidelines, diet-related diseases are on the rise. In addition, a growing share of U.S. consumers proactively chooses nutritional supplements as an alternative preventative way of maintaining good health, a $25.5 billion industry in the United States. This paper investigates possible linkages between the economics of consumer supplement choices and the relationship to important dietary and health outcomes. We use National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to estimate the impact of nutritional supplements intake on respondent‚Äôs body weight outcomes, controlling for diet quality.: The focus of this article is to determine whether nutritional supplements takers differ from non-takers with regard to their health outcomes when controlling for differences in diet quality, based on individual Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) score. The analysis applies treatment effects estimators that account for the selection bias and endogeneity of self-reported behavior and diet-health outcomes. The analysis demonstrates a negative association between supplement intake and BMI but no significant effect on an individual‚Äôs diet quality. Our findings suggest that individuals proactively invest into their health by taking nutritional supplements instead of improving diet quality through more nutritious food choices. Our results provide important contributions to the literature on a key food policy issue. Knowledge of the determinants of supplement demand in the context of strong diet-health trends should also be helpful to stakeholders in the U.S. produce sector in their competition over consumer market share.",PloS one,EPIDEM
0.680589264,31459588,Improvement of SO 2  Resistance of Low-Temperature Mn-Based Denitration Catalysts by Fe Doping,"The influence of vapor and SO 2 in coal firing flue gas on the selective catalytic reduction activity of Mn/Œ≥-Al 2 O 3 and Mn‚ÄìFe/Œ≥-Al 2 O 3 catalysts was investigated at 150‚Äì275 ¬∞C. Denitration experiments and detailed characterization of catalysts were conducted. Vapor had no chemical effects on denitration, and the mechanism of SO 2 deactivating the Mn/Œ≥-Al 2 O 3 catalysts was investigated in detail. This is due to the reaction between MnO 2 and SO 2 and the ammonium sulfate deposits forming on the surface. Sulfation of the Mn-active component was significantly reduced by doping the Mn/Œ≥-Al 2 O 3 catalyst with Fe. Iron doping also lowered the stability of the ammonium sulfate surface deposits, forcing them to rapidly decompose. Thus, iron doping significantly improved SO 2 resistance and the denitration efficiency of Mn‚ÄìFe/Œ≥-Al 2 O 3 catalysts was not clearly decreased.",ACS omega,CHEM
0.917189772,25404864,Community perceptions of a rural medical school: a pilot qualitative study,"Background This paper explores local community perceptions of a relatively new rural medical school. For the purposes of this paper, community engagement is conceptualized as involvement in planning, delivering, and evaluating the medical program. Although there are several reviews of patient involvement in medical curricula development, this study was designed to pilot an approach to exploring the perspectives of well members of the community in the transition of institutional policy on community engagement to one medical school. Methods An advertisement in the local newspaper invited volunteers to participate in a telephone interview about the new medical school. An independent researcher external to the medical school conducted the interviews using a topic guide. Audio recordings were not made, but detailed notes including verbatim statements were recorded. At least two research team members analyzed interview records for emergent themes. Human research ethics approval was obtained. Results Twelve interviews were conducted. Participants offered rich imaginings on the role of the school and expectations and opportunities for students. Most participants expressed strong and positive views, especially in addressing long-term health workforce issues. It was considered important that students live, mix, and study in the community. Some participants had very clear ideas about the need of the school to address specified needs, such as indigenous health, obesity, aging, drug and alcohol problems, teenage pregnancy, ethnic diversity, and working with people of low socioeconomic status. Conclusion This study has initiated a dialogue with potential partners in the community, which can be built upon to shape the medical school‚Äôs mission and contribution to the society it serves. The telephone interview approach and thematic analysis yielded valuable insights and is recommended for further studies. Our study was limited by its small study size and the single recruitment source.

0.338298425,29468488,TV viewing and incident venous thromboembolism: the Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities Study," TV viewing is associated with risk of arterial vascular diseases, but has not been evaluated in relation to venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in Western populations. In 1987‚Äì1989, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study obtained information on the frequency of TV viewing in participants aged 45‚Äì64 and followed them prospectively. In individuals free of prebaseline VTE (n = 15, 158), we used a Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incident VTE according to frequency of TV viewing (‚ÄúNever or seldom‚Äù, ‚ÄúSometimes‚Äù, ‚ÄúOften‚Äù or ‚ÄúVery often‚Äù). During the 299,767 person-years of follow-up, we identified 691 VTE events. In a multivariable-adjusted model, the frequency of TV viewing showed a positive dose‚Äìresponse relation with VTE incidence ( P for trend = 0.036), in which ‚Äúvery often‚Äù viewing TV carried 1.71 (95% CI 1.26‚Äì2.32) times the risk of VTE compared with ‚Äúnever or seldom‚Äù viewing TV. This association to some degree was mediated by obesity (25% mediation, 95% CI 10.7‚Äì27.5). Even among individuals who met a recommended level of physical activity, viewing TV ‚Äúvery often‚Äù carried 1.80 (1.04‚Äì3.09) times the risk of VTE, compared to viewing TV ‚Äúnever or seldom‚Äù. Greater frequency of TV viewing was independently associated with increased risk of VTE, partially mediated by obesity. Achieving a recommended physical activity level did not eliminate the increased VTE risk associated with frequent TV viewing. Avoiding frequent TV viewing as well as increasing physical activity and controlling body weight might be beneficial for VTE prevention. ",Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,EPIDEM

To identify causal variants for syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID), exome sequencing was performed using DNA samples from 22 consanguineous Pakistani families with ARID, of which 21 have additional phenotypes including microcephaly. To aid in variant identification, homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis were performed. DNA samples from affected family member(s) from every pedigree underwent exome sequencing. Identified rare damaging exome variants were tested for co-segregation with ID using Sanger sequencing. For seven ARID families, variants were identified in genes not previously associated with ID, including: EI24, FXR1 and TET3 for which knockout mouse models have brain defects; and CACNG7 and TRAPPC10 where cell studies suggest roles in important neural pathways. For two families, the novel ARID genes CARNMT1 and GARNL3 lie within previously reported ID microdeletion regions. We also observed homozygous variants in two ID candidate genes, GRAMD1B and TBRG1 , for which each has been previously reported in a single family. An additional 14 families have homozygous variants in established ID genes, of which 11 variants are novel. All ARID genes have increased expression in specific structures of the developing and adult human brain and 91% of the genes are differentially expressed in utero or during early childhood. The identification of novel ARID candidate genes and variants adds to the knowledge base that is required to further understand human brain function and development. ",Human genetics,BIOCHEM

NahI is in one family of the NAD(P) + -dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily (ALDH8). In this work, we report the cloning, expression, purification and preliminary structural and kinetic characterization of the recombinant NahI. The nahI gene was subcloned into a T7 expression vector and the enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli ArcticExpress at 12 ¬∫C as an N-terminal hexa-histidine-tagged fusion protein (6xHis-NahI). After the soluble protein was purified by affinity and size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments were conducted to analyze the oligomeric state and the overall shape of the enzyme in solution. The protein is a tetramer in solution and has nearly perfect 222 point group symmetry. Protein stability and secondary structure content were also evaluated by a circular dichroism spectroscopy assay under different thermal conditions. Furthermore, kinetic assays were conducted for the recombinant enzyme and, for the first time, K M (1.3 ¬± 0.3 ŒºM) and k cat (0.9 s ‚àí1 ) values were determined for this enzyme (at presumed NAD + saturation).

0.463735494,25728770,Bursty gene expression in the intact mammalian liver," Summary  Bursts of nascent mRNA have been shown to lead to substantial cell-cell variation in unicellular organisms, facilitating diverse responses to environmental challenges. It is unknown whether similar bursts and gene-expression noise occur in mammalian tissues. To address this, we combine single molecule transcript counting with dual-color labeling and quantification of nascent mRNA to characterize promoter states, transcription rates and transcript lifetimes in the intact mouse liver. We find that liver gene expression is highly bursty, with promoters stochastically switching between transcriptionally active and inactive states. Promoters of genes with short mRNA lifetimes are active longer, facilitating rapid response while reducing burst-associated noise. Moreover, polyploid hepatocytes exhibit less noise than diploid hepatocytes, suggesting a possible benefit to liver polyploidy. Thus temporal averaging and liver polyploidy dampen the intrinsic variability associated with transcriptional bursts. Our approach can be used to study transcriptional bursting in diverse mammalian tissues. ",Molecular cell,BIOCHEM

Eighteen adult sheep of similar age and body weight (25.03¬±1.52) were included in this study and out of these, 12 sheep were infected with single dose of infective third stage larvae of H. contortus at 2,000 larvae per sheep. The experimental sheep were allocated in three different groups‚Äô i.e. negative control (NC; no infection), control (C; H. contortus infected) and treatment (T; H. contortus infected+CT at 1.5% of the DM through LMM) and the experiment was conducted for a period of 90 d. The intake of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and digestibility of DM, OM, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) were comparable among three animal groups. However, digestibility of crude protein (CP) and ether extract (EE) were significantly (p<0.05) higher in NC group as compared to both C and T groups. Nitrogen (N) retention (g/d or % of N intake) was significantly (p = 0.038) lower in C group as compared to T and NC groups. Daily intake (g/kg W 0.75 ) of digestible crude protein (DCP), digestible organic matter (DOM) and total digestible nutrient (TDN) did not differ significantly (p<0.05) in the three groups. Haemoglobin (Hb) and packed cell volume (PCV) were significantly (p<0.001) higher in treatment group as compared to control. The level of Hb and PCV reduced (p<0.001) after 30 days of experimental feeding. CT significantly (p<0.001) reduced serum urea in T group as compared to NC and C groups. Serum proteins differed significantly (p<0.01) among the three groups. The activity of serum enzymes AST, ALT, ALP and LDH were also statistically non significant (p<0.05) among treatments.

We study recently emerged methacrylate reductase function that is thought to have emerged in the last century and reported in Geobacter sulfurreducens strain AM-1. We report the sequence and study the evolution of the operon coding for the flavin-containing methacrylate reductase (Mrd) and tetraheme cytochrome —Å (Mcc) in the genome of G . sulfurreducens AM-1.

0.854439732,28625783,Probabilistic Invasion Underlies Natural Gut Microbiome Stability," SUMMARY  Species compositions of gut microbiomes impact host health [ 1 ‚Äì 3 ], but the processes determining these compositions are largely unknown. An unexplained observation is that gut species composition varies widely between individuals but is largely stable over time within individuals [ 4 , 5 ]. Stochastic factors during establishment may drive these alternative stable states (colonized versus non-colonized) [ 6 , 7 ], which can influence susceptibility to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile. Here we sought to quantify and model the dose-response, dynamics, and stability of bacterial colonization in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) gut. Our precise, high-throughput technique revealed stable between-host variation in colonization when individual germ-free flies were fed their own natural commensals (including the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum). Some flies were colonized while others remained germ-free even at extremely high bacterial doses. Thus, alternative stable states of colonization exist even in this low complexity model of host-microbe interactions. These alternative states are driven by a fundamental asymmetry between the inoculum population and the stably colonized population that is mediated by spatial localization and a population bottleneck, which makes stochastic effects important by lowering the effective population size. Prior colonization with other bacteria reduced the chances of subsequent colonization, thus increasing the stability of higher diversity guts. Therefore, stable gut diversity may be driven by inherently stochastic processes, which has important implications for combatting infectious diseases and for stably establishing probiotics in the gut.   eTOC Blurb  Obadia et al. show how natural gut commensal bacteria colonize their host. Using Drosophila as a model, they find that stochastic colonization produces stable host-to-host variation in species diversity. The results suggest strategies to engineer microbiome diversity.

This is particularly important in marine benthic organisms that rely on larval dispersal to maintain connectivity among populations. Here, we report the results of a genetic survey of the ascidian Pyura chilensis from three localities along the southeastern Pacific. This study follows up on a previous report that described a genetic break in this region among localities only 20¬†km apart. By implementing a hierarchical sampling design at four spatial levels and using ten polymorphic microsatellite markers, we test whether differences in fine‚Äêscale population structure explain the previously reported genetic break. We compared genetic spatial autocorrelations, as well as kinship and relatedness distributions within and among localities adjacent to the genetic break. We found no evidence of significant autocorrelation at the scale up to 50¬†m despite the low dispersal potential of P.¬†chilensis that has been reported in the literature. We also found that the proportion of related individuals in close proximity (<1¬†km) was higher than the proportion of related individuals further apart. These results were consistent in the three localities. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of related individuals can be nonrandom at small spatial scales and suggests that dispersal might be occasionally limited in this species or that larval cohorts can disperse in the plankton as clustered groups. Overall, this study sheds light on new aspects of the life of this ascidian as well as confirms the presence of a genetic break at 39¬∞S latitude. Also, our data indicate there is not enough evidence to confirm that this genetic break can be explained by differences in fine‚Äêscale genetic patterns among localities.",Ecology and evolution,ECO

0.6925065,28027449,Novel Chemical Scaffolds for Inhibition of Rifamycin-Resistant RNA Polymerase Discovered from High-Throughput Screening," Rifampin has been a cornerstone of tuberculosis (TB) treatment since its introduction. The rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB makes the development of novel therapeutics effective against these strains an urgent need. Site-specific mutations in the target enzyme of rifampin, RNA polymerase (RNAP), comprises the majority (~97%) of rifamycin-resistant (Rif R ) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis . To identify novel inhibitors of bacterial RNAP, an in vitro plasmid-based transcription assay that utilizes malachite green (MG) to detect transcribed RNA containing MG aptamers was developed. This assay was optimized in a 384-well plate format and used to screen 150,000 compounds against an Escherichia coli homolog of the most clinically relevant Rif R RNAP (Œ≤S531L) containing a mutation (Œ≤‚ÄôV408G) that compensates for the fitness defect of this Rif R mutant. Following confirmation and concentration-response studies, 10 compounds were identified with similar in vitro inhibition values across a panel of WT and Rif R  E. coli and M. tuberculosis RNAPs. Four compounds identified from the screen are active against M. tuberculosis in culture at concentrations below 200 ŒºM. Initial follow-up has resulted in the elimination of one scaffold due to potential pan assay interference ( PAINS ). ",SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,BIOCHEM

It introduces algorithms for quantitative assessment of vessel length, diameter, the functional microcirculatory density distribution and red blood-cell (RBC) velocity in individual vessels as well as its distribution. The technique was validated and compared to commercial software. The method was applied to the sublingual microcirculation in a healthy volunteer and in a patient during cardiac surgery. Analysis time was reduced from hours to minutes compared to previous methods requiring manual vessel identification. Vessel diameter was detected with high accuracy ( > 80%, d >¬†3¬†pixels). Capillary length was estimated within 5¬†pixels accuracy. Velocity estimation was very accurate (>95%) in the range [2.5, 1,000]¬†pixels/s.

One possible explanation is the difficulty of designing an intervention that corresponds to the local context and culture. Objectives To understand people's perceptions of health and CVD, and how people prevent CVD in an urban setting in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Methods A qualitative study was performed through focus group discussions and individual research interviews. Participants were selected purposively in terms of socio-economic status (SES), lay people, community leaders and government officers. Data were analysed by using content analysis. Results Seven categories were identified: (1) heart disease is dangerous, (2) the cause of heart disease, (3) men have no time for health, (4) women are caretakers for health, (5) different information-seeking patterns, (6) the role of community leaders and (7) patterns of lay people's action. Each category consists of sub-categories according to the SES of participants. The main theme that emerged was one of balance and harmony, indicating the necessity of assuring a balance between ‚Äògood‚Äô and ‚Äòbad‚Äô habits. Conclusions The basic concepts of balance and harmony, which differ between low and high SES groups, must be understood when tailoring community interventions to reduce CVD risk factors.",Global health action,EPIDEM
0.072479087,20588797,Generic real-time uniform K-space sampling method for high-speed swept-Source optical coherence tomography,"We developed a universal, real-time uniform K-space sampling (Rt-UKSS) method for high-speed swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). An external clock uniform in K-space was generated. The clock was synchronized with the zero-crossing time of an interferometric calibration signal and used as triggers for a high-speed data acquisition system in a point-by-point fashion, hence enabling uniform data sampling in K-space. Different from the numerical calibration algorithm commonly used in an SS-OCT system, the method reported here does not require over-sampling, thus greatly reducing the demand for digitization, data processing and storage speed. The Rt-UKSS method is adaptive and applicable to a generic SS-OCT system of a wide range of A-scan rates without special adjustment. We successfully implemented the Rt-UKSS method in an SS-OCT system based on a Fourier-domain mode-locked laser (FDML) of a 40-kHz scanning rate. Real-time imaging of biological tissues using such a system was demonstrated with a measured axial resolution of 9.3 Œºm and detection sensitivity greater than 120dB.",Optics express,ENG

0.186669581,20855505,An Atg9-containing compartment that functions in the early steps of autophagosome biogenesis,"A reservoir of Atg9-containing vesicles and tubules provides the initial membranes necessary for autophagophore formation in yeast. Eukaryotes use the process of autophagy, in which structures targeted for lysosomal/vacuolar degradation are sequestered into double-membrane autophagosomes, in numerous physiological and pathological situations. The key questions in the field relate to the origin of the membranes as well as the precise nature of the rearrangements that lead to the formation of autophagosomes. We found that yeast Atg9 concentrates in a novel compartment comprising clusters of vesicles and tubules, which are derived from the secretory pathway and are often adjacent to mitochondria. We show that these clusters translocate en bloc next to the vacuole to form the phagophore assembly site (PAS), where they become the autophagosome precursor, the phagophore. In addition, genetic analyses indicate that Atg1, Atg13, and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate are involved in the further rearrangement of these initial membranes. Thus, our data reveal that the Atg9-positive compartments are important for the de novo formation of the PAS and the sequestering vesicle that are the hallmarks of autophagy.",The Journal of cell biology,BIOCHEM
0.755715879,27804950,Powerful decomposition of complex traits in a diploid model,"Explaining trait differences between individuals is a core and challenging aim of life sciences. Here, we introduce a powerful framework for complete decomposition of trait variation into its underlying genetic causes in diploid model organisms. We sequence and systematically pair the recombinant gametes of two intercrossed natural genomes into an array of diploid hybrids with fully assembled and phased genomes, termed Phased Outbred Lines (POLs). We demonstrate the capacity of this approach by partitioning fitness traits of 6,642 Saccharomyces cerevisiae POLs across many environments, achieving near complete trait heritability and precisely estimating additive (73%), dominance (10%), second (7%) and third (1.7%) order epistasis components. We map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and find nonadditive QTLs to outnumber (3:1) additive loci, dominant contributions to heterosis to outnumber overdominant, and extensive pleiotropy. The POL framework offers the most complete decomposition of diploid traits to date and can be adapted to most model organisms.  Dissecting the architecture of complex trait is challenging.

0.369370438,28814050,Segmental Contributions to Sagittal-plane Whole-body Angular Momentum When Using Powered Compared to Passive Ankle-foot Prostheses on Ramps," Understanding the effects of an assistive device on dynamic balance is crucial, particularly for robotic leg prostheses. Analyses of dynamic balance commonly evaluate the range of whole-body angular momentum ( H ). However, the contributions of individual body segments to overall H throughout gait may yield futher insights, specifically for people with transtibial amputation using powered prostheses. We evaluated segment contributions to H using Statistical Parametric Mapping to assess the effects of prosthesis type (powered vs passive) and ramp angle on segmental coordination. The slope main effect was significant in all segments, the prosthesis main effect was significant in the prosthetic leg (device and residuum) and trunk, and the slope by prosthesis interaction effect was significant in the prosthetic leg and trunk. The magnitude of contributions to sagittal-plane H from the prosthetic leg was larger when using the powered prosthesis. The trunk contributed more positive (backward) H after prosthetic leg toe-off when using the powered prosthesis on inclines, similar to the soleus muscle. However, trunk contributions to H on declines were similar when using a powered and passive prosthesis, suggesting that the powered prosthesis may not replicate soleus function when walking downhill. Our novel assessment method evaluated robotic leg prostheses not only based on local joint mechanics, but also considering whole-body biomechanics. ",IEEE ...

Here, we describe a scalable biosynthetic gene cluster activation method wherein the gene clusters are disassembled at interoperonic regions in vitro using CRISPR/Cas9 and then reassembled with PCR-amplified, short DNAs, carrying synthetic promoters, using transformation assisted recombination (TAR) in yeast. This simple, cost-effective, and scalable method allows for the simultaneous generation of combinatorial libraries of refactored gene clusters, eliminating the need to understand the transcriptional hierarchy of the silent genes. In two test cases, this in vitro disassembly-TAR reassembly method was used to create collections of promoter-replaced gene clusters that were tested in parallel to identify versions that enabled secondary metabolite production. Activation of the atolypene ( ato ) gene cluster led to the characterization of two unprecedented, bacterial cyclic sesterterpenes, atolypene A ( 1 ) and B ( 2 ), which are moderately cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines. This streamlined in vitro disassembly- in vivo reassembly method offers a simplified approach for silent gene cluster refactoring that should facilitate the discovery of natural products from silent gene clusters cloned from either metagenomes or cultured bacteria.

0.566814871,20614020,Mechanisms of Vascular Damage by Hemorrhagic Snake Venom Metalloproteinases: Tissue Distribution and  In Situ  Hydrolysis,"Background Envenoming by viper snakes constitutes an important public health problem in Brazil and other developing countries. Local hemorrhage is an important symptom of these accidents and is correlated with the action of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs). The degradation of vascular basement membrane has been proposed as a key event for the capillary vessel disruption. However, SVMPs that present similar catalytic activity towards extracellular matrix proteins differ in their hemorrhagic activity, suggesting that other mechanisms might be contributing to the accumulation of SVMPs at the snakebite area allowing capillary disruption. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work, we compared the tissue distribution and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins induced by jararhagin (highly hemorrhagic SVMP) and BnP1 (weakly hemorrhagic SVMP) using the mouse skin as experimental model. Jararhagin induced strong hemorrhage accompanied by hydrolysis of collagen fibers in the hypodermis and a marked degradation of type IV collagen at the vascular basement membrane. In contrast, BnP1 induced only a mild hemorrhage and did not disrupt collagen fibers or type IV collagen. Injection of Alexa488-labeled jararhagin revealed fluorescent staining around capillary vessels and co-localization with basement membrane type IV collagen. The same distribution pattern was detected with jararhagin-C (disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich domains of jararhagin). In opposition, BnP1 did not accumulate in the tissues. Conclusions/Significance These results show a particular tissue distribution of hemorrhagic toxins accumulating at the basement membrane. This probably occurs through binding to collagens, which are drastically hydrolyzed at the sites of hemorrhagic lesions. Toxin accumulation near blood vessels explains enhanced catalysis of basement membrane components, resulting in the strong hemorrhagic activity of SVMPs. This is a novel mechanism that underlies the difference between hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic SVMPs, improving the understanding of snakebite pathology. Author Summary Snakebite accidents by vipers cause a massive disturbance in hemostasis and tissue damage at the snakebite area. The systemic effects are often prevented by antivenom therapy. However, the local symptoms are not neutralized by antivenoms and are related to the temporary or permanent disability observed in many patients. Although the mechanisms involved in coagulation or necrotic disturbances induced by snake venoms are well known, the disruption of capillary vessels by SVMPs leading to hemorrhage and consequent local tissue damage is not fully understood. In our study, we reveal the mechanisms involved in hemorrhage induced by SVMPs by comparing the action of high and low hemorrhagic toxins isolated from Bothrops venoms, in mouse skin. We show remarkable differences in the tissue distribution and hydrolysis of collagen within the hemorrhagic lesions induced by high and low hemorrhagic metalloproteinases. According to our data, tissue accumulation of hemorrhagic toxins near blood vessel walls allowing the hydrolysis of basement membrane components, preferably collagen IV. These observations unveil new mechanistic insights supporting the local administration of metalloproteinases inhibitors as an alternative to improve snakebite treatment besides antivenom therapy.",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,IMMUN

Procedures  A three-pot, four-step synthesis was implemented on the ELIXYS FLEX/CHEM radiosynthesizer (Sofie Biosciences) and optimized for radiochemical yield (RCY), radiochemical purity (RCP) as well as chemical purity during several production runs ( n = 24). The compound was purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE) with a Sep-Pak Plus Accell CM cartridge, thereby avoiding HPLC purification.    Results  Under optimized conditions, AY of 1.4‚Äì2.2 GBq of [ 18 F]FBnTP were obtained from 9.4 to 12.0 GBq [ 18 F]fluoride in 90‚Äì92 min (RCY = 28.6 ¬± 5.1 % with n = 3). Molar activities ranged from 80 to 99 GBq/¬µmol at the end of synthesis. RCP of final formulations was > 99 % at the end of synthesis and > 95 % after 8 h. With starting activities of 23.2‚Äì33.0 GBq, RCY decreased to 16.1 ¬± 0.4 % ( n = 3). The main cause of the decline in RCY when high amounts of [ 18 F]fluoride are used is radiolytic decomposition of [ 18 F]FBnTP during SPE purification.    Conclusions  In initial attempts, the probe was synthesized with RCY < 0.6 % when starting activities up to 44.6 GBq were used. Rapid radiolysis of the intermediate 4-[ 18 F]fluorobenzaldehyde and the final product [ 18 F]FBnTP during purification was identified as the main cause for low yields in high-activity runs. Radiolytic decomposition was hindered by the addition of radical scavengers during synthesis, purification, and formulation, thereby improving AY and RCP. The formulated probe in injectable form was synthesized without the use of HPLC and passed all applicable quality control tests.  ",Molecular imaging and biology,BIOCHEM

Early identification and intervention of precursor lesions such as leukoplakia have always been emphasized, as this can drastically improve the scenario. The oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including oral cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate salivary oxidant and antioxidant levels in patients with different clinicopathological stages of oral leukoplakia. Materials and Methods: An analytical study with case‚Äìcontrol study design was conducted. Forty newly diagnosed cases of oral leukoplakia were considered in the case group. The equal number of age- and gender-matched subjects was included in the control study group. Unstimulated whole-saliva supernatant was used to determine the levels of lipid peroxidation, glutathione S-transferase, nitrites, and uric acid using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer. The statistical comparisons were performed by independent Student‚Äôs unpaired t test and one-way analysis of variance with post hoc analysis. Correlation analysis was performed among salivary parameters and with baseline variables. Results: End products of free radical damage and nitrite levels were significantly increased in patients with oral leukoplakia compared to controls. Conversely, levels of glutathione S-transferase and uric acid were significantly decreased in the study group in comparison with healthy subjects. Similar trends were seen along the clinical stages and histopathological grades of leukoplakia. Conclusion: Elevated levels of reactive species with a concomitant reduction in antioxidants in leukoplakia indicate its potential as an early diagnostic marker.",Journal of International Society of Preventive & Community Dentistry,CLINIC
0.078904114,28724410,Identification and characterization of long non-coding RNAs in subcutaneous adipose tissue from castrated and intact full-sib pair Huainan male pigs,"Background Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate adipose tissue metabolism, however, their function on testosterone deficiency related obesity in humans is less understood. For this research, intact and castrated male pigs are the best model animal because of their similar proportional organ sizes, cardiovascular systems and metabolic features. Results We identified lncRNAs in subcutaneous adipose tissue by deep RNA-sequencing using the intact and castrated Huainan male pigs. The results showed that castration reduced serum testosterone but increased body fatness-related traits (serum triglyceride levels, backfat thickness, intramuscular fat content, and adipocyte size). Meanwhile, 343 lncRNAs from subcutaneous adipose tissue were identified, including 223 intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), 68 anti-sense lncRNAs, and 52 intronic lncRNAs. It was predicted that there were 416 recognition sites for C/EBPŒ± in the 303 lncRNA promoter region, and 13 adipogenesis-promoting miRNAs and five adipogenesis-depressing miRNAs target these lncRNAs. Eighteen lncRNAs, including nine up- and nine down-regulated had more than 2-fold differential expression between the castrated and intact male pigs ( q- value¬†<¬†0.05). Functional analysis indicated that these 18 lncRNAs and their target genes were involved in fatty acid, insulin, and the adipocytokine signaling pathway. We further analyzed the features of a conserved mouse lncRNA gene ENSMUST00000189966 and found it mainly expressed in the cell nucleus and target the Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2 Group F Member 2 ( NR2F2 ) gene. In 3¬†T3-L1 cells, differentiation down-regulated their expression, but dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly up-regulated their expression in a concentration-dependent manner ( P <¬†0.05). Conclusions These results suggested that lncRNAs and their target genes might participated in the castration-induced fat deposition and provide a new therapeutic target for combatting testosterone deficiency-related obesity.

0.055832751,21918174,"rILYd4, a Human CD59 Inhibitor Enhances Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity of Ofatumumab against Rituximab-resistant B-cell Lymphoma Cells and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia","  Purpose  Ofatumumab (OFA) is an anti-CD20 antibody recently approved for treatment of fludarabine and alemtuzumab refractory chronic lymphocytic lymphomia (CLL); it mediates much stronger complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) than Rituximab (RTX). Human CD59, a key membrane complement regulator that inhibits CDC, is highly expressed in B-cell malignancies and its up-regulation is an important determinant of the sensitivity of B-cell malignancies to RTX treatment. Previously, we have demonstrated that the potent CD59 inhibitor rILYd4 sensitizes RTX-resistant lymphoma cells to RTX-mediated CDC. Here, we further investigated whether rILYd4 can sensitize B-cell malignancies to OFA-mediated CDC and whether either OFA-mediated CDC or rILYd4-enhanced OFA-mediated CDC correlates with CD20 or CD59 expression, known biomarkers involved in RTX activity.    Experimental Design  RTX-resistant cell lines and primary CLL cells were used to investigate the antitumor efficacy of the combination of rILYd4 with OFA or RTX. Propidium iodide staining or Alamar blue assay were employed to evaluate the CDC effect. The levels of CD20 and CD59 on the cell membrane were analyzed by flow cytometry.    Results  rILYd4 enhanced CDC effects mediated by OFA or RTX on RTX-resistant lymphoma cells and primary CLL cells in vitro . The sensitivity to CDC effects mediated by OFA positively correlated with the ratio of CD20/CD59 and negatively correlated with CD59 levels on CLL cells. The degree to which rILYd4 enhanced CDC correlated positively with the CD59 levels on CLL cells.    Conclusions  These data suggest that rILYd4 may enhance the anti-cancer activity of OFA and RTX in B-cell malignancies that have relapsed after prior antibody-based therapies.

The potential risks due to disposal of these wastes are magnified as a result of dense refinement of poultry production and the decreasing amount of land available for waste disposal. The study aims at studying the microbiological biodiversity of poultry waste and paddy straw based co-composting system. The predominant microflora of the poultry manure were bacteria, fungi, enteric bacteria and spore forming bacteria whose population was high at the initiation of composting but decreased significantly as the compost approached maturity. The initial load of inherent enteric groups of bacteria in poultry waste, that also includes some pathogenic ones, is considerably reduced and some new vital groups contributed to compost quality as the microbiological biodiversity sets in the system and becomes stable. Major fraction of nitrogen of poultry waste was subjected to ammonia volatilization and a fraction of it conserved by co-composting it in conjunction with wastes having low nitrogen contents. In the treatment T 1 and T 5 , where poultry manure and paddy straws alone were composted, 60 and 30 percent of organic carbon, respectively, was lost over a period of six months.

Consistent with prior research, methadone was associated with better retention than buprenorphine/naloxone. And, heroin-assisted treatment was associated with better retention than methadone among treatment-refractory patients. Only a single study examined retention in MAT for longer than one year, and studies of behavioral therapies may have lacked statistical power; thus, studies with longer-term follow-ups and larger samples are needed.

We examined whether stimulation of Œ≤ 3 adrenergic receptors (Œ≤ 3 ARs), coupled to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation, would re‚Äêestablish NO/redox balance, relieve oxidative inhibition of the membrane proteins eNOS and Na + ‚ÄêK + (NK) pump, and improve vascular function in a new animal model of hyperglycemia. Methods and Results We established hyperglycemia in male White New Zealand rabbits by infusion of S961, a competitive high‚Äêaffinity peptide inhibitor of the insulin receptor. Hyperglycemia impaired endothelium‚Äêdependent vasorelaxation by ‚Äúuncoupling‚Äù of eNOS via glutathionylation (eNOS‚ÄêGSS) that was dependent on NADPH oxidase activity. Accordingly, NO levels were lower while O 2  ‚Ä¢‚àí levels were higher in hyperglycemic rabbits. Infusion of the Œ≤ 3 AR agonist CL316243 (CL) decreased eNOS‚ÄêGSS, reduced O 2  ‚Ä¢‚àí , restored NO levels, and improved endothelium‚Äêdependent relaxation. CL decreased hyperglycemia‚Äêinduced NADPH oxidase activation as suggested by co‚Äêimmunoprecipitation experiments, and it increased eNOS co‚Äêimmunoprecipitation with glutaredoxin‚Äê1, which may reflect promotion of eNOS de‚Äêglutathionylation by CL. Moreover, CL reversed hyperglycemia‚Äêinduced glutathionylation of the Œ≤ 1 NK pump subunit that causes NK pump inhibition, and improved K + ‚Äêinduced vasorelaxation that reflects enhancement in NK pump activity. Lastly, eNOS‚ÄêGSS was higher in vessels of diabetic patients and was reduced by CL, suggesting potential significance of the experimental findings in human diabetes. Conclusions Œ≤ 3 AR activation restored NO/redox balance and improved endothelial function in hyperglycemia. Œ≤ 3 AR agonists may confer protection against diabetes‚Äêinduced vascular dysfunction.",Journal of the American Heart Association,BIOCHEM
0.40789916,30646750,"Outcome measures in post-stroke arm rehabilitation trials: do existing measures capture outcomes that are important to stroke survivors, carers, and clinicians?","Objective: We sought to (1) identify the outcome measures currently used across stroke arm rehabilitation randomized trials, (2) identify and compare outcomes important to stroke survivors, carers and clinicians and (3) describe where existing research outcome measures capture outcomes that matter the most to stroke survivors, carers and clinicians and where there may be discrepancies. Methods: First, we systematically identified and extracted data on outcome measures used in trials within a Cochrane overview of arm rehabilitation interventions. Second, we conducted 16 focus groups with stroke survivors, carers and clinicians using nominal group technique, supplemented with eight semi-structured interviews, to identify these stakeholders‚Äô most important outcomes following post-stroke arm impairment. Finally, we described the constructs of each outcome measure and indicated where stakeholders‚Äô important outcomes were captured by each measure. Results: We extracted 144 outcome measures from 243 post-stroke arm rehabilitation trials. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity section (used in 79/243 trials; 33%), Action Research Arm Test (56/243; 23%), and modified Ashworth Scale (53/243; 22%) were most frequently used. Stroke survivors ( n =‚Äâ43), carers ( n =‚Äâ10) and clinicians ( n =‚Äâ58) identified 66 unique, important outcomes related to arm impairment following stroke. Between one and three outcomes considered important by the stakeholders were captured by the three most commonly used assessments in research. Conclusion: Post-stroke arm rehabilitation research would benefit from a reduction in the number of outcome measures currently used, and better alignment between what is measured and what is important to stroke survivors, carers and clinicians.",Clinical rehabilitation,CLINIC
0.497262569,19540596,FcŒµRI -INDUCED ACTIVATION BY LOW ANTIGEN CONCENTRATIONS RESULTS IN NUCLEAR SIGNALS IN THE ABSENCE OF DEGRANULATION," High affinity IgE receptor (FcŒµRI)-induced activation of mast cells results in degranulation and generation of leukotrienes and cytokines. FcŒµRI-induced mast cell activation was analyzed at a single cell basis using a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell line transfected with a reporter plasmid containing three tandem NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) binding sites fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Surprisingly, with this sensitive detection system, there is activation of IgE sensitized cells at concentrations of antigen as low as 10pg/ml, which was 10-fold lower than was detected by degranulation. There were differences in signaling pathways leading to degranulation compared to NFAT-mediated gene activation. Both signaling to NFAT activation and degranulation required Syk and calcineurin. However inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway blocked degranulation but did not NFAT activation. The results also indicate that NFAT was activated at lower intracellular signals compared to degranulation. Therefore, FcŒµRI activation can result in nuclear signals in the absence of the release of mediators. ",Molecular immunology,IMMUN
0.428130296,31405963,Regulation of photoprotection gene expression in  Chlamydomonas  by a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and a homolog of CONSTANS,"Significance Photoprotection is an indispensable component of abiotic stress tolerance in all photosynthetic organisms. In contrast to land plants, the transcript abundance of photoprotection genes is strongly controlled by light in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . Here we show that the repression of photoprotection genes in low light depends on 2 putative components of a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. We also show that this regulation of gene expression depends on a transcription factor that is conserved among plants and algae and that acts downstream of the putative E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Our work provides mechanistic insight into how a deeply conserved light signaling pathway is wired differently in C. reinhardtii , giving rise to light control of photoprotection gene expression. Photosynthetic organisms use nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanisms to dissipate excess absorbed light energy and protect themselves from photooxidation. In the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , the capacity for rapidly reversible NPQ (qE) is induced by high light, blue light, and UV light via increased expression of LHCSR and PSBS genes that are necessary for qE. Here, we used a forward genetics approach to identify SPA1 and CUL4, components of a putative green algal E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, as critical factors in a signaling pathway that controls light-regulated expression of the LHCSR and PSBS genes in C. reinhardtii . The spa1 and cul4 mutants accumulate increased levels of LHCSR1 and PSBS proteins in high light, and unlike the wild type, they express LHCSR1 and exhibit qE capacity even when grown in low light. The spa1-1 mutation resulted in constitutively high expression of LHCSR and PSBS RNAs in both low light and high light. The qE and gene expression phenotypes of spa1-1 are blocked by mutation of CrCO, a B-box Zn-finger transcription factor that is a homolog of CONSTANS, which controls flowering time in plants. CONSTANS-like cis -regulatory sequences were identified proximal to the qE genes, consistent with CrCO acting as a direct activator of qE gene expression. We conclude that SPA1 and CUL4 are components of a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts upstream of CrCO, whose regulatory function is wired differently in C. reinhardtii to control qE capacity via cis -regulatory CrCO-binding sites at key photoprotection genes.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,BIOCHEM

0.840622577,19446526,Crystal structures of two archaeal 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylases of the Ogg2 family provide structural insight into guanine/8-oxoguanine distinction," Summary  Among the four DNA bases, guanine is particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage and the most common oxidative product, 7,8 dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), is the most prevalent lesion observed in DNA molecules. Fortunately, 8-oxoG is recognized and excised by the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Ogg) of the base excision repair pathway. Ogg enzymes are divided into three separate families, namely Ogg1, Ogg2, and AGOG. To date, structures of members of both Ogg1 and AGOG families are known but no structural information is available for members of Ogg2. Here we describe the first crystal structures of two archaeal Ogg2: Methanocaldococcus janischii Ogg (MjaOgg) and Sulfolobus solfataricus Ogg (SsoOgg). A structural comparison with OGG1 and AGOG suggested that the C-terminal lysine of Ogg2 may play a key role in discriminating between guanine and 8-oxoG. This prediction was substantiated by measuring the glycosylase/lyase activity of a C-terminal deletion mutant of MjaOgg. ","Structure (London, England : 1993)",BIOCHEM
0.744034978,25210141,Heterologous Immunological Effects of Early BCG Vaccination in Low-Birth-Weight Infants in Guinea-Bissau: A Randomized-controlled Trial,"Background. Bacillus Calmette‚ÄìGu√©rin (BCG) seems to have beneficial nonspecific effects; early BCG vaccination of low-birth-weight (LBW) newborns reduces neonatal mortality by >40% due to prevention of primarily septicemia and pneumonia. Methods. Within a randomized trial in LBW infants in Guinea-Bissau of early BCG vs the usual postponed BCG, a subgroup was bled 4 weeks after randomization. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1Œ≤, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-Œ≥ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ± were measured from whole-blood assays stimulated with innate agonists to Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, -4 or -7/8, or purified protein derivative (PPD). Results. Among 467 infants, BCG significantly increased the in vitro cytokine responses to purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD), as expected. BCG was also associated with increased responses to heterologous innate stimulation, particularly of the cytokines IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, TNF-Œ±, and IFN-Œ≥. Conclusion. Four weeks after immunization, BCG-vaccinated infants have a significantly increased production of cytokines upon heterologous challenge, particularly T helper cell type 1 polarizing and typically monocyte-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines.

0.213816993,16013438,LDL induces intracellular signalling and cell migration via atypical LDL-binding protein T-cadherin," Cadherins are a superfamily of adhesion molecules that mediate Ca 2+ -dependent cell‚Äìcell adhesion. T-cadherin (T-cad), a unique glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored member of the cadherin superfamily, was initially identified by immunoblotting of vascular cell membranes as an atypical low affinity low density lipoprotein (LDL)-binding protein. It is not known whether this heterophilic interaction is physiologically relevant. Expression of T-cadherin is upregulated in vascular cells during atherosclerosis, restenosis and tumour angiogenesis, conditions characterized by enhanced cell migration and growth. Elevated levels of serum low density lipoproteins (LDL), which result in cholesterol accumulation in vascular wall, is a widely accepted risk factor in atherosclerosis development. Additionally to its metabolic effects, LDL can produce hormone-like effects in a number of cell types. This study has utilized HEK293 cells and L929 cells stably transfected with T-cadherin cDNA to investigate T-cad-dependent responses to LDL. Stable expression of T-cad in both HEK293 and L929 cells results in significantly ( p < 0.05) elevated specific surface binding of [I 125 ]-LDL. Compared with mock-transfectants, cells expressing T-cad exhibit significantly ( p < 0.01) enhanced LDL-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca 2+ -stores and a significantly ( p < 0.01) increased migration toward an LDL gradient (0.1% BSA + 60 Œºg/ml LDL) in Boyden chamber migration assay. Thus LDL-binding to T-cad is capable of activating physiologically relevant intracellular signaling and functional responses. ",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,BIOCHEM
0.749701602,30956114,Fluorescent Gene Tagging of Transcriptionally Silent Genes in hiPSCs,"Summary We describe a multistep method for endogenous tagging of transcriptionally silent genes in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). A monomeric EGFP (mEGFP) fusion tag and a constitutively expressed mCherry fluorescence selection cassette were delivered in tandem via homology-directed repair to five genes not expressed in hiPSCs but important for cardiomyocyte sarcomere function: TTN , MYL7 , MYL2 , TNNI1 , and ACTN2 . CRISPR/Cas9 was used to deliver the selection cassette and subsequently mediate its excision via microhomology-mediated end-joining and non-homologous end-joining. Most excised clones were effectively tagged, and all properly tagged clones expressed the mEGFP fusion protein upon differentiation into cardiomyocytes, allowing live visualization of these cardiac proteins at the sarcomere. This methodology provides a broadly applicable strategy for endogenously tagging transcriptionally silent genes in hiPSCs, potentially enabling their systematic and dynamic study during differentiation and morphogenesis. Highlights ‚Ä¢ Five cardiomyocyte genes silent in hiPSCs were endogenously tagged with mEGFP ‚Ä¢ CRISPR/Cas9 and MMEJ/NHEJ DNA repair accomplish efficient cassette excision ‚Ä¢ mEGFP-tagged hiPSC clones successfully differentiate into cardiomyocytes ‚Ä¢ Tagged cardiomyocytes allow live cell microscopy of sarcomere structure and dynamics Gunawardane and colleagues use CRISPR/Cas9 to deliver an excisable cassette to transcriptionally silent loci in hiPSCs, then accomplish excision of the cassette in a second step utilizing Cas9/CRISPR and the MMEJ and NHEJ DNA-repair pathways. Excision results in mEGFP tagging of the targeted loci. Upon differentiation, each of five tagged cell lines appropriately expresses a unique fluorescent fusion protein localized to the sarcomere in live cardiomyocytes.",Stem cell reports,BIOCHEM

Although PNs have been reported in the auditory system in several species, there is disagreement about the distribution of PNs within the inferior colliculus (IC), an important auditory hub in the midbrain. Furthermore, PNs in many brain areas are preferentially associated with GABAergic cells, but whether such an association exists in the IC has not been addressed. We used Wisteria floribunda agglutinin staining and immunohistochemistry in guinea pigs to examine PNs within the IC. PNs are present in all IC subdivisions and are densest in the central portions of the IC. Throughout the IC, PNs are preferentially associated with GABAergic cells. Not all GABAergic cells are surrounded by PNs, so the presence of PNs can be used to subdivide IC GABAergic cells into ‚Äúnetted‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-netted‚Äù categories.

0.428310284,24262312,Synergistic induction of interferon Œ± through TLR-3 and TLR-9 agonists stimulates immune responses against measles virus in neonatal cotton rats," Immunization of neonates is problematic because of the immaturity of their immune system and the presence of maternal antibodies, both of which affect B cell responses. We tested the effects of co-administration of measles vaccine with a combination of TLR-3 (pI:C) and TLR-9 (ODN2216, optimized for human TLR-9) agonists on the ability to induce an effective immune response in neonatal cotton rats. TLR-9 expression in cotton rat lymphocytes was at the same low level as in human lymphocytes, which is in contrast to mice that express higher levels. TLR-3 expression levels were comparable between cotton rats, mice and humans. A combination of TLR-3 and TLR-9 agonists synergistically induced high levels of type I interferon in neonatal spleen cells and higher levels of IL-10 as compared to adult spleen cells. Previously, it was shown that type I interferon stimulates B cell generation and antibody secretion in vitro and in vivo , and that IL-10 has immunomodulatory effects. The simultaneous induction of both type I interferon and IL-10 indicated that this immunization regimen could be both effective and safe. Neonatal cotton rats did not generate neutralizing antibodies after measles vaccination in the first week of life (although a T cell response was detectable). However, co-administration of the TLR-3 and TLR-9 agonist combination with measles vaccine in neonatal cotton rats induced neutralizing antibody responses comparable to those after adult immunization. This immunization regimen was also effective in neonatal cotton rats in the presence of natural maternal antibodies, although antibody titers were lower than after immunization in the absence of maternal antibodies.

0.507031167,19776286,A Chimera Analysis of  Prestin  Knockout Mice," A chimera is a genetic composite containing a unique mix of cells derived from more than one zygote. This mouse model allows one to learn how cells of contrasting genotype functionally interact in vivo . Here we investigate the effect that different proportions of prestin-containing outer hair cells (OHC) have on cochlear amplification. In order to address this issue, we developed a prestin chimeric mouse in which both ROSA26 wildtype (WT) and prestin knockout (KO) genotypes are present in a single cochlea. The WT ROSA26 mice express a cell marker, allowing one to identify cells originating from the WT genome. Examination of cochlear tissue indicated that prestin chimeric mice demonstrate a mosaic in which mutant and normal OHCs interleave along the cochlear partition, similar to all other chimeric mouse models. The anatomical distribution of prestin-containing OHCs was compared with physiological data including thresholds and tuning curves for the compound action potential (CAP) recorded in anesthetized mice. Analysis of these measures did not reveal mixed phenotypes in which the distribution of prestin-containing OHCs impacted sensitivity and frequency selectivity to different degrees. However, by reducing the number of prestin-containing OHCs, phenotypes intermediate between WT and KO response patterns were obtained. Accordingly, we demonstrate a proportional reduction in sensitivity and in the tip length of CAP tuning curves as the number of OHCs derived from the KO genome increases, i.e., genotype ratio and phenotype are closely related.

0.308099797,22628619,Silencing of enzymes involved in ceramide biosynthesis causes distinct global alterations of lipid homeostasis and gene expression [S],"Dysregulation of ceramide synthesis has been associated with metabolic disorders such as atherosclerosis and diabetes. We examined the changes in lipid homeostasis and gene expression in Huh7 hepatocytes when the synthesis of ceramide is perturbed by knocking down serine pal mitoyltransferase subunits 1, 2, and 3 (SPTLC123) or dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DEGS1). Although knocking down all SPTLC subunits is necessary to reduce total ceramides significantly, depleting DEGS1 is sufficient to produce a similar outcome. Lipidomic analysis of distribution and speciation of multiple lipid classes indicates an increase in phospholipids in SPTLC123-silenced cells, whereas DEGS1 depletion leads to the accumulation of sphingolipid intermediates, free fatty acids, and diacylglycerol. When cer amide synthesis is disrupted, the transcriptional profiles indicate inhibition in biosynthetic processes, downregulation of genes involved in general endomembrane traffi cking, and upregulation of endocytosis and endosomal recycling. SPTLC123 silencing strongly affects the expression of genes involved with lipid metabolism. Changes in amino acid, sugar, and nucleotide metabolism, as well as vesicle trafficking between organelles, are more prominent in DEGS1-silenced cells. These studies are the first to provide a direct and comprehensive understanding at the lipidomic and transcriptomic levels of how Huh7 hepatocytes respond to changes in the inhibition of ceramide synthesis.",Journal of lipid research,BIOCHEM
0.978141644,23070592,The Limitations of Simple Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Assuming Gene Independence," Since its first publication in 2003, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method, based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, has been heavily used, modified, and also questioned. Recently a simplified approach, using a one-sample t- test score to assess enrichment and ignoring gene-gene correlations was proposed by Irizarry et al. 2009 as a serious contender. The argument criticizes GSEA‚Äôs nonparametric nature and its use of an empirical null distribution as unnecessary and hard to compute. We refute these claims by careful consideration of the assumptions of the simplified method and its results, including a comparison with GSEA‚Äôs on a large benchmark set of 50 datasets. Our results provide strong empirical evidence that gene-gene correlations cannot be ignored due to the significant variance inflation they produced on the enrichment scores and should be taken into account when estimating gene set enrichment significance. In addition, we discuss the challenges that the complex correlation structure and multi-modality of gene sets pose more generally for gene set enrichment methods.

A variance components analysis was undertaken to estimate the heritable and environmental components that contribute to S. japonicum infection in the Poyang Lake region of Jiangxi Province, PR China. The total target population was 3148 from four separate administrative villages. Two thousand seven hundred and five of these comprised 400 families ranging in size from 3 to 188. After adjustments were made for gender, water contact and past history of having had schistosomiasis, the heritable component was estimated to account for as much as 58% of the phenotype variation under the polygenic model.

We excluded studies using implantable loop recorders and pacemakers. Using a random-effects model we calculated the overall AF detection rate. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore potential sources for heterogeneity. Quality of reporting was assessed using the tool developed by Downs and Black. Results Portable ECG monitoring was used in 18 studies (n=117‚Äâ436) and Holter monitoring was used in 36 studies (n=8498). The AF detection rate using portable ECG monitoring was 1.7% (95% CI 1.4 to 2.1), with significant heterogeneity between studies (p<0.001). There was a moderate linear relationship between total monitoring time and AF detection rate (r=0.65, p=0.003), and meta-regression identified total monitoring time (p=0.005) and body mass index (p=0.01) as potential contributors to heterogeneity.

0.81109369,15864304,Endocannabinoid signalling depends on the spatial pattern of synapse activation," The brain's endocannabinoid retrograde messenger system decreases presynaptic transmitter release 1 , 2 , but its physiological function is uncertain. We show that endocannabinoid signalling is absent when spatially dispersed synapses are activated on rodent cerebellar Purkinje cells, but that it reduces presynaptic glutamate release when nearby synapses are active. This switching of signalling according to the spatial pattern of activity is controlled by postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate (mGluR1) receptors, which are activated disproportionately when glutamate spillover between synapses produces synaptic crosstalk. When spatially distributed synapses are activated, endocannabinoid inhibition of transmitter release can be rescued by inhibiting glutamate uptake to increase glutamate spillover. Endocannabinoid signalling initiated by mGluR1 is a homeostatic mechanism, which detects synaptic crosstalk and down-regulates glutamate release in order to promote synaptic independence.

0.122598931,29636548,Hypoxia-induced exosomes contribute to a more aggressive and chemoresistant ovarian cancer phenotype: A novel mechanism linking STAT3/Rab proteins," Hypoxia-mediated tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance are major clinical challenges in ovarian cancer. Exosomes released in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment may contribute to these challenges by transferring signaling proteins between cancer cells and normal cells. We observed that ovarian cancer cells exposed to hypoxia significantly increased their exosome release by up-regulating Rab27a, down-regulating Rab7, LAMP1/2, NEU-1, and also by promoting a more secretory lysosomal phenotype. STAT3 knockdown in ovarian cancer cells reduced exosome release by altering the Rab family proteins Rab7 and Rab27a under hypoxic conditions. We also found that exosomes from patient-derived ascites ovarian cancer cell lines cultured under hypoxic conditions carried more potent oncogenic proteins - STAT3 and FAS that are capable of significantly increasing cell migration/invasion and chemo-resistance in vitro and tumor progression/metastasis in vivo . Hypoxic ovarian cancer cells derived exosomes (HEx) are proficient in re-programming the immortalized fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FT) to become pro-tumorigenic in mouse fallopian tubes. In addition, cisplatin efflux via exosomes was significantly increased in ovarian cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Co-culture of HEx with tumor cells led to significantly decreased dsDNA damage and increased cell survival in response to cisplatin treatment. Blocking exosome release by known inhibitor Amiloride or STAT3 inhibitor and treating with cisplatin resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis, decreased colony formation and proliferation. Our results demonstrate that HEx are more potent in augmenting metastasis/chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer, and may serve as a novel mechanism for tumor metastasis, chemo-resistance and a point of intervention for improving clinical outcomes.

0.215246288,22493588,15-Month-Old Infants Fast Map Words but Not Representational Gestures of Multimodal Labels,"This study investigated whether 15-month-old infants fast map multimodal labels, and, when given the choice of two modalities, whether they preferentially fast map one better than the other. Sixty 15-month-old infants watched films where an actress repeatedly and ostensively labeled two novel objects using a spoken word along with a representational gesture. In the test phase, infants were assigned to one of three conditions: Word, Word‚Äâ+‚ÄâGesture, or Gesture. The objects appeared in a shelf next to the experimenter and, depending on the condition, infants were prompted with either a word, a gesture, or a multimodal word‚Äìgesture combination. Using an infant eye tracker, we determined whether infants made the correct mappings. Results revealed that only infants in the Word condition had learned the novel object labels. When the representational gesture was presented alone or when the verbal label was accompanied by a representational gesture, infants did not succeed in making the correct mappings. Results reveal that 15-month-old infants do not benefit from multimodal labeling and that they prefer words over representational gestures as object labels in multimodal utterances. Findings put into question the role of multimodal labeling in early language development.",Frontiers in psychology,PSYCH
0.220320928,24297083,Vocal caricatures reveal signatures of speaker identity,"What are the features that impersonators select to elicit a speaker's identity? We built a voice database of public figures ( targets ) and imitations produced by professional impersonators. They produced one imitation based on their memory of the target ( caricature ) and another one after listening to the target audio ( replica ). A set of naive participants then judged identity and similarity of pairs of voices. Identity was better evoked by the caricatures and replicas were perceived to be closer to the targets in terms of voice similarity. We used this data to map relevant acoustic dimensions for each task. Our results indicate that speaker identity is mainly associated with vocal tract features, while perception of voice similarity is related to vocal folds parameters. We therefore show the way in which acoustic caricatures emphasize identity features at the cost of loosing similarity, which allows drawing an analogy with caricatures in the visual space.",Scientific reports,PSYCH

Methods: Eligible patients received 400‚Äâmg vorinostat once daily on days 1‚Äì14, 1000‚Äâmg‚Äâm ‚àí2 capecitabine twice daily on days 1‚Äì14, and 60‚Äâmg‚Äâm ‚àí2 cisplatin on day 1 every 3 weeks. Plasma levels of acetyl-H3, HDAC2, and p21 were measured for correlative analysis. The primary end point was the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Secondary end points included the response rate, PFS, overall survival (OS), and safety profile. Results: A total of 45 patients with HER2-negative GC were included in this study. The objective response rate was 42%. The median PFS was 5.9 months, and the 6-month PFS rate was 44.4%. The median OS was 12.7 months. Most common grade 3‚Äì4 toxicities were neutropenia (41%), fatigue (34%), anorexia (32%), thromboembolism (27%), stomatitis (14%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). High plasma acetyl-H3 and p21 levels were significantly associated with a poor OS ( P =0.02 and P =0.03, respectively).

0.795890686,29610289,E-cadherin/ROS1 inhibitor synthetic lethality in breast cancer," The cell adhesion glycoprotein E-cadherin ( CDH1 ) is commonly inactivated in breast tumours. Precision medicine approaches that exploit this characteristic are not available. Using perturbation screens in breast tumour cells with CRISPR-Cas9 engineered CDH1 mutations, we identified synthetic lethality between E-cadherin deficiency and inhibition of the tyrosine kinase ROS1. Data from large-scale genetic screens in molecularly diverse breast tumour cell lines established that the E-cadherin/ROS1 synthetic lethality was not only robust in the face of considerable molecular heterogeneity but was also elicited with clinical ROS1 inhibitors including foretinib and crizotinib. ROS1 inhibitors induced mitotic abnormalities and multinucleation in E-cadherin defective cells, phenotypes associated with a defect in cytokinesis and aberrant p120-catenin phosphorylation and localisation. In vivo , ROS1 inhibitors produced profound anti-tumour effects in multiple models of E-cadherin defective breast cancer. This data therefore provides the pre-clinical rationale for assessing ROS1 inhibitors such as the licensed drug crizotinib in appropriately stratified patients. ",Cancer discovery,ONCO

Participants viewed photographs of faces whose gaze was directed ahead, to the left or to the right. Target letters then appeared unpredictably to the left or right. As expected, targets in the location indicated by gaze were detected more rapidly. In nonanxious volunteers the effects of fearful gaze did not differ from neutral gaze, but fearful expression had a more powerful influence in a selected high anxious group. Attention is thus more likely to be guided by the direction of fearful than neutral gaze, but only in anxiety-prone individuals. ",Visual cognition,PSYCH
0.700856092,18312695,Functional discrimination of membrane proteins using machine learning techniques,"Background Discriminating membrane proteins based on their functions is an important task in genome annotation. In this work, we have analyzed the characteristic features of amino acid residues in membrane proteins that perform major functions, such as channels/pores, electrochemical potential-driven transporters and primary active transporters. Results We observed that the residues Asp, Asn and Tyr are dominant in channels/pores whereas the composition of hydrophobic residues, Phe, Gly, Ile, Leu and Val is high in electrochemical potential-driven transporters. The composition of all the amino acids in primary active transporters lies in between other two classes of proteins. We have utilized different machine learning algorithms, such as, Bayes rule, Logistic function, Neural network, Support vector machine, Decision tree etc. for discriminating these classes of proteins. We observed that most of the algorithms have discriminated them with similar accuracy. The neural network method discriminated the channels/pores, electrochemical potential-driven transporters and active transporters with the 5-fold cross validation accuracy of 64% in a data set of 1718 membrane proteins. The application of amino acid occurrence improved the overall accuracy to 68%. In addition, we have discriminated transporters from other Œ±-helical and Œ≤-barrel membrane proteins with the accuracy of 85% using k-nearest neighbor method. The classification of transporters and all other proteins (globular and membrane) showed the accuracy of 82%. Conclusion The performance of discrimination with amino acid occurrence is better than that with amino acid composition. We suggest that this method could be effectively used to discriminate transporters from all other globular and membrane proteins, and classify them into channels/pores, electrochemical and active transporters.",BMC bioinformatics,CS
0.385016096,27286871,Variation in use of targeted therapies for metastatic renal cell carcinoma: Results from a Dutch population-based registry,"Background For patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), targeted therapies have entered the market since 2006. The aims of this study were to evaluate the uptake and use of targeted therapies for mRCC in The Netherlands, examine factors associated with the prescription of targeted therapies in daily clinical practice and study their effectiveness in terms of overall survival (OS). Methods Two cohorts from PERCEPTION, a population-based registry of mRCC patients, were used: a 2008‚Äì2010 Cohort ( n =‚Äâ645) and a 2011‚Äì2013 Cohort ( n =‚Äâ233). Chi-squared tests for trend were used to study time trends in the use of targeted therapy. Patients were grouped based on the eligibility criteria of the SUTENT trial, the trial that led to sunitinib becoming standard of care, to investigate the use of targeted therapies amongst patients fulfilling those criteria. Multi-level logistic regression was used to identify patient subgroups that are less likely to receive targeted therapies. Results Approximately one-third of patients fulfilling SUTENT trial eligibility criteria did not receive any targeted therapy (29¬†% in the 2008‚Äì2010 Cohort; 35¬†% in the 2011‚Äì2013 Cohort). Patients aged 65+ years were less likely to receive targeted therapy in both cohorts and different risk groups (odds ratios range between 0.84‚Äì0.92); other factors like number of metastatic sites were of influence in some subgroups. Amongst treated patients, there was a decreasing trend in sunitinib use over time ( p =‚Äâ0.0061), and an increasing trend in pazopanib use ( p =‚Äâ0.0005). Conclusions Targeted therapies have largely replaced interferon-alfa as first-line standard of care. Nevertheless, many eligible patients in Dutch daily practice did not receive targeted therapies despite their ability to improve survival. Reasons for their apparent underutilisation should be examined more carefully.

0.639396983,19142192,Transient focal ischemia induces extensive temporal changes in rat cerebral MicroRNAome," MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22 nucleotides long, noncoding RNAs that control cellular function by either degrading mRNAs or arresting their translation. To understand their functional significance in ischemic pathophysiology, we profiled miRNAs in adult rat brain as a function of reperfusion time after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Of the 238 miRNAs evaluated, 8 showed increased and 12 showed decreased expression at least at 4 out of 5 reperfusion time points studied between 3 h and 3 days compared with sham. Of those, 17 showed >5 fold change. Bioinformatics analysis indicated a correlation between miRNAs altered to several mRNAs known to mediate inflammation, transcription, neuroprotection, receptors function, and ionic homeostasis. Antagomir-mediated prevention of mir-145 expression led to an increased protein expression of its downstream target superoxide dismutase-2 in the postischemic brain. In silico analysis showed sequence complementarity of eight miRNAs induced after focal ischemia to 877 promoters indicating the possibility of noncoding RNA-induced activation of gene expression. The mRNA expression of the RNases Drosha and Dicer, cofactor Pasha, and the pre-miRNA transporter exportin-5, which modulate miRNA biogenesis, were not altered after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Thus, the present studies indicate a critical role of miRNAs in controlling mRNA transcription and translation in the postischemic brain.

We evaluated the relationship between 25-OH vitamin D levels and susceptibility to natural H1N1 infection and H1N1 vaccine responses in HIV infected individuals.    Methods  This was a sub study of an H1N1 vaccine trial conducted at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009/10. We compared the 25-OH vitamin D levels among individuals with and without baseline evidence of prior H1N1 infection and between vaccine responders and non-responders.    Results  120 participants enrolled in the trial, 71% male, 68% African American, median age 46 years. The majority had controlled HIV disease. At baseline, 86% had 25-OH vitamin D levels < 30 ng/ml and 54% had levels < 20 ng/ml. Thirty participants (25%) had evidence of prior H1N1 exposure. There was no difference in mean 25-OH vitamin D levels among patients with or without prior natural H1N1 infection (21 ng/ml vs 20 ng/ml, p=0.72). Among participants without previous H1N1 exposure, only 61% developed protective antibody titers following vaccination. 25-OH vitamin D levels were similar between vaccine responders (20 ng/ml) and non-responders (20 ng/ml) (p=0.83).

Main outcome measures The annual incidence of VO was estimated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyse factors affecting in-hospital mortality in the VO patients. Dependent variables included patient characteristics (age, sex and comorbidities), procedures (haemodialysis and surgery) and hospital factors (type of hospital and hospital volume). Results Overall, 58.9% of eligible patients were men and the average age was 69.2‚ÄÖyears. The estimated incidence of VO increased from 5.3/100‚ÄÖ000 population per year in 2007 to 7.4/100‚ÄÖ000 population per year in 2010. In-hospital mortality was 6%. There was a linear trend between higher rates of in-hospital mortality and greater age.

Densities, viscosities, refractive indices and surface tensions in a wide range of temperatures, as well as, isobaric heat capacities at 298.15 K, for this IL series are presented and discussed. It was found that the volumetric properties are barely affected by the geometric and structural isomerization, following a quite regular trend. A linear correlation between the glass transition temperature, T g , and the alkyl chain size was found; however, ILs with the acidic N-H group present a significant higher T g than the [ 1 C N -1 3 C 1 im][NTf 2 ] and [ 1 C N 3 C N im][NTf 2 ] series. It was found that the most viscous ILs, ([ 1 C 1 Him][NTf 2 ], [ 1 C 2 Him][NTf 2 ] and [ 1 C 1 2 C 1 Him][NTf 2 ]) have an acidic N-H group in the imidazolium ring in agreement with the observed increase of energy barrier of flow. The methylation in position 2, C(2), as well as, the N-H acidic group in the imidazolium ring, contribute to a significant variation in the cation-anion interactions and their dynamics, which is reflected in their charge distribution and polarizability leading to a significant differentiation of the refractive indices, surface tension and heat capacities.

Currently, there are no validated objective measurement tools or devices to assess tummy time. The purpose of this study was to: 1) test the practicality of using devices on infants as an objective measure of tummy time, and 2) test the accuracy of developed algorithms and cut-points for predicting prone posture. Thirty-two healthy infants aged 4 to 25 weeks completed a protocol of 12 positions. Infants were placed in each position for 3 minutes while wearing a MonBaby (chest), GENEActiv (right hip) and two ActiGraphs (right hip and ankle). Direct observation was the criterion measure. The accuracy of the algorithms or cut-points to predict prone on floor, non-prone and prone supported positions were analyzed. Parents also completed a practicality questionnaire. Algorithms and cut-points to classify posture using devices from MonBaby, GENEActiv and ActiGraph (hip and ankle) were 79%, 95%, 90% and 88% accurate at defining tummy time and 100%, 98%, 100% and 96% accurate at defining non-prone positions, respectively. GENEActiv had the smallest mean difference and limits of agreement (-8.4s, limits of agreement [LoA]: -78.2 to 61.3s) for the prone on floor positions and ActiGraph Hip had the smallest mean difference and LoA for the non-prone positions (-0.2s, LoA: -1.2 to 0.9s). The majority of parents agreed all devices were practical and feasible to use with MonBaby being the preferred device. The evaluated algorithms and cut-points for GENEActiv and ActiGraph (hip) are of acceptable accuracy to objectively measure tummy time (time spent prone on floor).

0.496975275,21597992,Docking glycosaminoglycans to proteins: analysis of solvent inclusion,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are anionic polysaccharides, which participate in key processes in the extracellular matrix by interactions with protein targets. Due to their charged nature, accurate consideration of electrostatic and water-mediated interactions is indispensable for understanding GAGs binding properties. However, solvent is often overlooked in molecular recognition studies. Here we analyze the abundance of solvent in GAG-protein interfaces and investigate the challenges of adding explicit solvent in GAG-protein docking experiments. We observe PDB GAG-protein interfaces being significantly more hydrated than protein‚Äìprotein interfaces. Furthermore, by applying molecular dynamics approaches we estimate that about half of GAG-protein interactions are water-mediated. With a dataset of eleven GAG-protein complexes we analyze how solvent inclusion affects Autodock 3, eHiTs, MOE and FlexX docking. We develop an approach to de novo place explicit solvent into the binding site prior to docking, which uses the GRID program to predict positions of waters and to locate possible areas of solvent displacement upon ligand binding. To investigate how solvent placement affects docking performance, we compare these results with those obtained by taking into account information about the solvent position in the crystal structure. In general, we observe that inclusion of solvent improves the results obtained with these methods. Our data show that Autodock 3 performs best, though it experiences difficulties to quantitatively reproduce experimental data on specificity of heparin/heparan sulfate disaccharides binding to IL-8. Our work highlights the current challenges of introducing solvent in protein-GAGs recognition studies, which is crucial for exploiting the full potential of these molecules for rational engineering.

0.114448146,30886592,Key Informants Specify Core Elements of Peer Supports for Parents With Serious Mental Illness,"Background: Researchers have documented the lack of evidence-based interventions for parents with serious mental illness (SMI). Given the prevalence of parenthood among individuals with SMI, the value placed on parenthood, and their diverse vulnerabilities, a robust, theoretically sound and empirically tested model of peer supports would likely provide a valuable complement to psychiatric services. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for a model of peer supports using a program theory development process and guided by stages of evidence-informed innovation outlined by the National Implementation Research Network. Methods: This study employed a developmental design in the initial stage of a larger study of the development, implementation, and testing of peer supports to address three questions: (1) What needs of parents with SMI are particularly well-suited to peer supports? (2) What do peers have to offer parents? and (3) What is unique about peer supports for parents? A purposeful sampling strategy was used to recruit key informants ( n = 22) familiar with peer supports, family-focused care and the experiences of families living with parental mental illness. Individual interviews were conducted face-to-face or on the telephone and a full-day group interview was conducted using a workshop format. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively to identify themes reflecting potential core program elements. Results: Consistent themes drawn from data comprise four core program elements: engage, explore, plan, and access and advocate. These core activities are likely founded on practice principles that include a focus on families and their strengths, cultural sensitivity, and acknowledgment of the trauma experienced by many parents. The findings raised a number of challenges in contemplating peer supports for parents with SMI, including the need for ongoing support for peers. Discussion: In developing this model, aspects of organizational context must be considered along with specification of the characteristics of parents with SMI suited to this approach and the attributes of peers providing support. A fully-articulated model must include parallel theories of change for the workforce, as well as for participating parents, to support well-being in the context of peer relationships and the success of parents with SMI in family life.",Frontiers in psychiatry,PSYCH
0.006970472,29035207,Novel Quantitative Analytical Approaches for Rotor Identification and Associated Implications for Mapping,"  Goal  Clinical studies identifying rotors confirming these sites for ablation in treating cardiac arrhythmias have had inconsistent results with the currently available analysis techniques. The aim of this study is to evaluate four new signal analysis approaches ‚Äì multiscale frequency (MSF), Shannon entropy (SE), Kurtosis (Kt), and multiscale entropy (MSE) ‚Äì in their ability to identify the pivot point of rotors.    Methods  Optical mapping movies of ventricular tachycardia were used to evaluate the performance and robustness of SE, Kt, MSF and MSE techniques with respect to several clinical limitations: decreased time duration, reduced spatial resolution, and the presence of meandering rotors. To quantitatively assess the robustness of the four techniques, results were compared to the ‚Äútrue‚Äù rotor(s) identified using optical mapping-based phase maps.    Results  The results demonstrate that MSF, Kt, and MSE accurately identified both stationary and meandering rotors. In addition, these techniques remained accurate under simulated clinical limitations: shortened electrogram duration and decreased spatial resolution. Artifact mildly affected the performance of MSF, Kt, and MSE, but strongly impacted the performance of SE.    Conclusion  These results motivate further validation using intracardiac electrograms to see if these approaches can map rotors in a clinical setting and whether they apply to more complex arrhythmias including atrial or ventricular fibrillation.    Significance  New techniques providing more accurate rotor localization could improve characterization of arrhythmias and, in turn, offer a means to accurately evaluate whether rotor ablation is a viable and effective treatment for chaotic cardiac arrhythmias.

0.981321268,25943439,Tandem Duplication and Random Loss for mitogenome rearrangement in  Symphurus  (Teleost: Pleuronectiformes),"Background The mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes) exhibit highly diversified types of large-scale gene rearrangements. We have reported that the mitogenomes of Crossorhombus azureus (Bothidae), Samariscus latus (Samaridae) and Cynoglossus fishes (Cynoglossidae) show different types of gene rearrangements. Results In the present study, the complete mitogenomes of two Symphurus species (Cynoglossidae), Symphurus plagiusa and Symphurus orientalis , were determined. The gene order in the S. plagiusa mitogenome is the same as that of a typical vertebrate (without any gene rearrangements). Surprisingly, large-scale gene rearrangements have occurred in S. orientalis . In the rearranged fragment from the control region (CR) to the WANCY tRNA cluster (tRNA cluster of tRNA-W , tRNA-A , tRNA-N , tRNA-C and tRNA-Y ) in the S. orientalis mitogenome, tRNA-V and tRNA-M have been translocated to the 3‚Äô end of the 16S rRNA gene, with six large intergenic spacers over 20¬†bp in length. In addition, an origin for light-strand replication (O L ) structure that is typically located in the WANCY region was absent in both the S. plagiusa and S. orientalis mitogenomes. It is generally recognized that a sequence in the WANCY region that encodes tRNAs forms a hairpin structure (O L -like structure) and can act as the O L when the typical locus is lost. Moreover, an additional O L -like structure was identified near the control region in the S. plagiusa mitogenome. Conclusions The positions of the intergenic spacers and the rearranged genes of the S. orientalis mitogenome strongly indicate that the mechanism underlying the rearrangement of this mitogenome was Tandem Duplication and Random Loss. Additionally, two O L -like regions substituting for the typical locus were found in the S. plagiusa mitogenome. We speculate that the ancestral mitogenomes of S. plagiusa and S. orientalis also had this characteristic, such that if both O L -like structures functioned during mitochondrial replication, they could initiate duplicate replications of the light strand (L-strand), leading to duplication of the region between the two structures. We consider that this mechanism may account for the gene duplication that occurred during the gene rearrangement process in the evolution of the ancestral mitogenome to the S. orientalis mitogenome.

Background More than 50 million people around the world are investigated for tuberculosis using sputum smear microscopy annually. This process requires repeated visits and patients often drop out. Methods and Findings This clinical trial of adults with cough ‚â•2 wk duration (in Ethiopia, Nepal, Nigeria, and Yemen) compared the sensitivity/specificity of two sputum samples collected ‚Äúon the spot‚Äù during the first visit plus one sputum sample collected the following morning (spot-spot-morning [SSM]) versus the standard spot-morning-spot (SMS) scheme. Analyses were per protocol analysis (PPA) and intention to treat (ITT). A sub-analysis compared just the first two smears of each scheme, spot-spot and spot-morning. In total, 6,627 patients (3,052 SSM/3,575 SMS) were enrolled; 6,466 had culture and 1,526 were culture-positive. The sensitivity of SSM (ITT, 70.2%, 95% CI 66.5%‚Äì73.9%) was non-inferior to the sensitivity of SMS (PPA, 65.9%, 95% CI 62.3%‚Äì69.5%). Similarly, the specificity of SSM (ITT, 96.9%, 95% CI 93.2%‚Äì99.9%) was non-inferior to the specificity of SMS (ITT, 97.6%, 95% CI 94.0%‚Äì99.9%). The sensitivity of spot-spot (ITT, 63.6%, 95% CI 59.7%‚Äì67.5%) was also non-inferior to spot-morning (ITT, 64.8%, 95% CI 61.3%‚Äì68.3%), as the difference was within the selected ‚àí5% non-inferiority limit (difference ITT‚Ää=‚Ää1.4%, 95% CI ‚àí3.7% to 6.6%). Patients screened using the SSM scheme were more likely to provide the first two specimens than patients screened with the SMS scheme (98% versus 94.2%, p <0.01). The PPA and ITT analysis resulted in similar results. Conclusions The sensitivity and specificity of SSM are non-inferior to those of SMS, with a higher proportion of patients submitting specimens. The scheme identifies most smear-positive patients on the first day of consultation. Trial Registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN53339491   Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary  Editors' Summary Background Every year, nearly 10 million people develop tuberculosis‚Äîa contagious bacterial infection that usually affects the lungs (pulmonary tuberculosis)‚Äîand about 1.7 million people die from the disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which causes tuberculosis, is spread in airborne droplets when people with the disease cough or sneeze. Thus, to control tuberculosis, it is essential that infected individuals are rapidly identified and treated. The ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù diagnostic test for tuberculosis is mycobacterial culture, in which laboratory staff try to grow M. tuberculosis from sputum (mucus brought up from the lungs by coughing). However, although this test is sensitive (it detects most patients with tuberculosis) and has a high specificity (a low rate of false-positive results), it is too slow to produce results and too complex for routine use in the low- and middle-income countries where tuberculosis mainly occurs. In these countries, patients are usually investigated using direct sputum smear microscopy, a cheaper but less sensitive test in which multiple sputum samples treated with the acid-fast Ziehl-Neelsen stain are examined for the presence of M. tuberculosis bacilli. Why Was This Study Done? In most national tuberculosis control programs, patients provide an ‚Äúon the spot‚Äù specimen during their initial consultation, a specimen collected at home the next morning, and another on-the-spot specimen when they bring their morning specimen to the clinic (a ‚Äúspot-morning-spot,‚Äù or SMS, collection scheme). Unfortunately, patients often fail to return with their morning sample. Furthermore, the examination of three samples strains the limited laboratory resources of developing countries. Based on several recent reviews, the World Health Organization recently recommended that only two samples need be examined, a policy change that reduces the laboratory workload but does not avoid the problems of collecting a morning sample and patient drop-out during the diagnostic process. In this non-inferiority, cluster randomized trial, the researchers compare the sensitivity and specificity of a spot-spot-morning (SSM; two on-the-spot specimens collected during the first clinic visit an hour apart, and a third specimen collected at home the next morning) scheme for tuberculosis diagnosis with those of the standard SMS scheme. A non-inferiority trial investigates whether an intervention is not worse than a control intervention; a cluster randomized trial randomly assigns groups of patients rather than individual patients to the test and control interventions. What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers enrolled 6,627 patients in Ethiopia, Nepal, Nigeria, and Yemen who had had a cough for more than two weeks (a characteristic symptom of tuberculosis). A quarter of the patients had culture-positive tuberculosis. The centers participating in the study were randomly assigned each week for a year to use either the SMS or the SSM sample collection scheme. Compared to mycobacterial culture, the sensitivities of the SSM and SMS schemes were 70.2% and 65.9%, respectively, which indicates that the new scheme was non-inferior to the SMS scheme. Similarly, the specificity of SSM (96.9%) was non-inferior to that of SMS (97.6%). Importantly, the sensitivity of diagnosis using just the first two samples collected in the SSM scheme was also non-inferior to the sensitivity of diagnosis using the first two samples collected in the SMS scheme (63.6% versus 64.8%; the researchers defined non-inferiority of SSM as a difference in its sensitivity compared to that of SMS of less than ‚àí5%). Finally, patients tested using the SSM scheme were more likely to provide the first two samples than patients tested using the SMS scheme (98% versus 94.2%). What Do These Findings Mean? These findings suggest that a sputum collection scheme in which two samples are collected one hour apart followed by a morning specimen could identify as many smear-positive patients as the standard SMS scheme. Importantly, they also indicate that examination of the first two specimens alone identifies most smear-positive patients independently of which scheme is used. These findings suggest that the SSM scheme might be more suitable for tuberculosis diagnosis than the SMS scheme in locations where patients are likely to drop out of the diagnosis process (for example, in low- and middle-income countries, where patients often live a long way from clinics). However, for an SSM scheme to work effectively, an on-site laboratory with a same-day turn-around service will be essential, and tuberculosis clinics will need to minimize contact between patients waiting to provide their second on-the-spot specimen.

0.968453944,30058060,INHIBITION OF APOPTOSIS EXACERBATES FATIGUE-DAMAGE TENDON INJURIES IN AN  IN VIVO  RAT MODEL," Tendinopathy is a common and progressive musculoskeletal disease. Increased apoptosis is an end-stage tendinopathy manifestation, but its contribution to the pathology of the disease is unknown. A previously established in vivo model of fatigue-damage accumulation shows that increased apoptosis is correlated with the severity of induced tendon damage, even in early onset of the disease, supporting its implication in the pathogenesis of the disease. Consequently, this study aimed to determine: (1) whether apoptosis could be inhibited after fatigue damage and (2) whether its inhibition could lead to remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and pericellular matrix (PCM), to ultimately improve the mechanical properties of fatigue-damaged tendons. The working hypothesis was that, despite the low vascular nature of the tendon, apoptosis would be inhibited, prompting increased production of matrix proteins and restoring tendon mechanical properties. Rats received 2 or 5 d of systemic pan-caspase inhibitor (Q-VD-OPh) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) carrier control injections starting immediately prior to fatigue loading and were sacrificed at days 7 and 14 post-fatigue-loading. Systemic pan-caspase inhibition for 2 d led to a surprising increase in apoptosis, but inhibition for 5 d increased the population of live cells that could repair the fatigue damage. Further analysis of the 5 d group showed that effective inhibition led to an increased population of cells producing ECM and PCM proteins, although typically in conjunction with oxidative stress markers. Ultimately, inhibition of apoptosis led to further deterioration in mechanical properties of fatigue-damaged tendons. ",European cells & materials,BIOCHEM
0.898371736,19458618,Down syndrome suppression of tumor growth and the role of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1," The incidence of many cancer types is significantly reduced in individuals with Down syndrome 1 ‚Äì 4 and it is proposed that this broad cancer protection is conferred by the elevated expression of one or more of the 231 supernumerary genes on the extra copy of chromosome 21. One such gene is the Down syndrome candidate region-1 ( Dscr1, RCAN1 ), which encodes a protein that suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenic signalling via the calcineurin pathway 5 ‚Äì 10 . Here we show that DSCR1 is elevated in Down syndrome individuals and a mouse model of Down syndrome. Further, we show that the modest elevation in expression afforded by a single extra transgenic copy of Dscr1 is sufficient to confer significant suppression of tumor growth in mice and that such resistance is a consequence of a deficit in tumor angiogenesis arising from suppression of the calcineurin pathway. We also provide evidence that attenuation of calcineurin activity by DSCR1 together with another chromosome 21 gene DYRK1A, may be sufficient to dramatically diminish angiogenesis. These data provide a mechanism for the reduced cancer incidence in Down syndrome and identifies the calcineurin signalling pathway and its regulators DSCR1 and DYRK1A as potential therapeutic targets in cancers arising in all individuals.

In this study, we have carried out in vitro and in vivo investigations on the bifunctional NrnA-homolog from Mycobacterium smegmatis , MSMEG_2630. The crystal structure of MSMEG_2630 was determined to 2.2-√Ö resolution and reveals a dimer consisting of two identical subunits with each subunit folding into an N-terminal DHH domain and a C-terminal DHHA1 domain. The overall structure and fold of the individual domains is similar to other members of DHH superfamily. However, MSMEG_2630 exhibits a distinct quaternary structure in contrast to other DHH phosphodiesterases. This novel mode of subunit packing and variations in the linker region that enlarge the domain interface are responsible for alternate recognitions of substrates in the bifunctional nanoRNases. MSMEG_2630 exhibits bifunctional 3‚Ä≤-5‚Ä≤ exonuclease [on both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) substrates] as well as CysQ-like phosphatase activity (on pAp) in vitro with a preference for nanoRNA substrates over single-stranded DNA of equivalent lengths.

0.145123889,21368059,THE RE1 BINDING PROTEIN REST REGULATES OLIGODENDROCYTE DIFFERENTIATION," The RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) represses the expression of neuronal-specific genes in non-neuronal cells by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other histone modifying and chromatin remodeling proteins to the DNA. REST regulation of the expression of neuronal genes is required for the orderly developmental transition from a neuroepithelial stem cell to a functional neuron. Here, we examined the expression and function of REST in neonatal rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). OPCs develop from the same neuroepithelial stem cells as neurons, can be reprogrammed to act as neural stem-like cells in vitro and require HDAC-mediated gene repression to develop into mature oligodendrocytes. We show that OPCs express functional REST protein and that REST interacts with several neuronal-specific genes whose expression is repressed in OPCs. REST transcript and protein expression increased 4-fold during the first 48hrs of oligodendrocyte differentiation. During this differentiation, the expression of RE1 containing neuronal genes further decreased as the transcription of oligodendrocyte specific genes was activated. Expression of a dominant negative form of REST in OPCs prevented the cells from developing into mature MBP-positive oligodendrocytes. Rather, the cells began to develop a neuronal phenotype characterized by increased expression of neuronal proteins, transcription factors, and cell type-specific marker antigens. REST over-expression promoted the development of 04-positive pre-oligodendrocytes from OPCs. Together, these results show that REST function is required for the differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes. By regulating the expression of neuronal genes, REST may also regulate the phenotypic plasticity of OPCs. ",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,NEURO
0.381529751,16543728,Effect of Intracellular Magnesium and Oxygen Tension on K + -Cl ‚àí  Cotransport in Normal and Sickle Human Red Cells," In red cells from normal individuals (HbA cells), the K + -Cl ‚àí cotransporter (KCC) is inactivated by low O 2 tension whilst in those from sickle cell patients (HbS cells), it remains fully active. Changes in free intracellular [Mg 2+ ] have been proposed as a mechanism. In HbA cells, KCC activity was stimulated by Mg 2+ depletion and inhibited by Mg 2+ loading but the effect of O 2 was independent of Mg 2+ . At all [Mg 2+ ] i s, the transporter was stimulated in oxygenated cells, minimally active in deoxygenated ones. By contrast, the stimulatory effects of O 2 was abolished by inhibitors of protein (de)phosphorylation. HbS cells had elevated KCC activity, which was of similar magnitude in oxygenated and deoxygenated cells, regardless of Mg 2+ clamping. In deoxygenated cells, the antisickling agent dimethyl adipimidate inhibited sickling, P sickle and KCC. Results indicate a role for protein phosphorylation in O 2 dependence of KCC, with different activities of the relevant enzymes in HbA and HbS cells, probably dependent on Hb polymerisation, but not on [Mg 2+ ] i .

Our study analyzed anti-fibrosis long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in activated human HSCs (hHSCs). We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis to determine whether lncRNA expression profile changes between hHSCs activation and quiescence. Eight differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and three pairs of co-expression lncRNAs-mRNAs were verified by quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 34146 DE lncRNAs were identified in this study. Via gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, we found several DE lncRNAs regulated hHSC activation by participating in DNA bending/packaging complex, growth factor binding and the Hippo signaling pathway ( p < 0.05). With lncRNA‚ÄìmRNA co-expression analysis, three lncRNAs were identified to be associated with connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ), fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2 ) and netrin-4 ( NTN4 ). The quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) results of the eight DE lncRNAs and three pairs of co-expression lncRNAs‚ÄìmRNAs were consistent with the RNA-seq data and previous reports.

A literature search was conducted using two databases, PubMed.gov and Science.gov, to identify all articles published after 2005 related to the Visian ICL (STAAR Surgical, Inc.). Articles were examined for their relevance to sizing methodology, clinical safety, and effectiveness, and the references cited in each article were also searched for additional relevant publications. The literature review revealed that all currently reported methods of determining the best-fit size of the ICL achieve similarly satisfactory results in terms of vault, the safe distance between the crystalline lens and the ICL. Specifically, meta-analysis demonstrated that sulcus-to-sulcus and white-to-white measurement-based sizing methods do not result in clinically meaningful nor statistically significant differences in vault (two-sample two-sided t -test using pooled mean and standard deviations; t (2,594)=1.33; P =0.18). The reported rates of complications related to vault are very low, except in two case series where additional risk factors such as higher levels of myopia and older age impacted the incidence of cataract. On the basis of preclinical studies and initial clinical reports, with up to 5 years of follow-up, the new VICMO central port design holds promise for further reduction of complications. Given its safety record and the significant improvement in vision and quality of life that the ICL makes possible, the benefits of ICL implantation outweigh the risks.","Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)",CLINIC
0.936647732,28144239,BRILIA: Integrated Tool for High-Throughput Annotation and Lineage Tree Assembly of B-Cell Repertoires,"The somatic diversity of antigen-recognizing B-cell receptors (BCRs) arises from Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) (VDJ) recombination and somatic hypermutation (SHM) during B-cell development and affinity maturation. The VDJ junction of the BCR heavy chain forms the highly variable complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), which plays a critical role in antigen specificity and binding affinity. Tracking the selection and mutation of the CDR3 can be useful in characterizing humoral responses to infection and vaccination. Although tens to hundreds of thousands of unique BCR genes within an expressed B-cell repertoire can now be resolved with high-throughput sequencing, tracking SHMs is still challenging because existing annotation methods are often limited by poor annotation coverage, inconsistent SHM identification across the VDJ junction, or lack of B-cell lineage data. Here, we present B-cell repertoire inductive lineage and immunosequence annotator (BRILIA), an algorithm that leverages repertoire-wide sequencing data to globally improve the VDJ annotation coverage, lineage tree assembly, and SHM identification. On benchmark tests against simulated human and mouse BCR repertoires, BRILIA correctly annotated germline and clonally expanded sequences with 94 and 70% accuracy, respectively, and it has a 90% SHM-positive prediction rate in the CDR3 of heavily mutated sequences; these are substantial improvements over existing methods. We used BRILIA to process BCR sequences obtained from splenic germinal center B cells extracted from C57BL/6 mice. BRILIA returned robust B-cell lineage trees and yielded SHM patterns that are consistent across the VDJ junction and agree with known biological mechanisms of SHM. By contrast, existing BCR annotation tools, which do not account for repertoire-wide clonal relationships, systematically underestimated both the size of clonally related B-cell clusters and yielded inconsistent SHM frequencies. We demonstrate BRILIA‚Äôs utility in B-cell repertoire studies related to VDJ gene usage, mechanisms for adenosine mutations, and SHM hot spot motifs. Furthermore, we show that the complete gene usage annotation and SHM identification across the entire CDR3 are essential for studying the B-cell affinity maturation process through immunosequencing methods.",Frontiers in immunology,IMMUN
0.83960204,23532212,Enzymatic saccharification of shrub willow genotypes with differing biomass composition for biofuel production,"In the conversion of woody biomass feedstocks into liquid fuel ethanol, the pretreatment process is the most critical and costly step. Variations in biomass composition based on genetic differences or environmental effects have a significant impact on the degree of accessibility accomplished by pretreatment and subsequent sugar release by enzymatic hydrolysis. To evaluate this, biomass from 10 genetically diverse, genotypes of shrub willow ( Salix spp.) was pretreated with a hot-water process at two levels of severity, hydrolyzed using a combination of two commercial enzyme cocktails, and the release of hexose and pentose monomers was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Among the genotypes selected for analysis, cellulose content ranged from 39 to 45% (w/w) and lignin content ranged from 20 to 23% (w/w) at harvest. Differences in the effectiveness of the pretreatment process were observed among the various willow genotypes. Correlations were identified between total sugar release and % cellulose and % lignin content. There was a significant effect of pretreatment severity on polysaccharide accessibility, but the response to pretreatments was different among the genotypes. At the high severity pretreatment ‚ÄòSV1‚Äô was the least recalcitrant with sugar release representing as much as 60% of total biomass.

0.434621289,23894224,Training Strategies for Mitigating the Effect of Proportional Control on Classification in Pattern Recognition Based Myoelectric Control," The performance of pattern recognition based myoelectric control has seen significant interest in the research community for many years. Due to a recent surge in the development of dexterous prosthetic devices, determining the clinical viability of multifunction myoelectric control has become paramount. Several factors contribute to differences between offline classification accuracy and clinical usability, but the overriding theme is that the variability of the elicited patterns increases greatly during functional use.  Proportional control has been shown to greatly improve the usability of conventional myoelectric control systems. Typically, a measure of the amplitude of the electromyogram (a rectified and smoothed version) is used to dictate the velocity of control of a device. The discriminatory power of myoelectric pattern classifiers, however, is also largely based on amplitude features of the electromyogram. This work presents an introductory look at the effect of contraction strength and proportional control on pattern recognition based control. These effects are investigated using typical pattern recognition data collection methods as well as a real-time position tracking test. Training with dynamically force varying contractions and appropriate gain selection is shown to significantly improve (p<0.001) the classifier‚Äôs performance and tolerance to proportional control.

0.398161759,27712062,A dual detection system for simultaneous measurement of intracellular fluorescent markers and cellular secretion," Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic Œ≤-cells within islets of Langerhans plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Although this process is essential for maintaining euglycemia, the underlying intracellular mechanisms that control it are still unclear. To allow simultaneous correlation between intracellular signal transduction events and extracellular secretion, an analytical system was developed that integrates fluorescence imaging of intracellular probes with high-speed automated insulin immunoassays. As a demonstration of the system, intracellular [Ca 2+ ] ([Ca 2+ ] i ) was measured by imaging Fura-2 fluorescence simultaneously with insulin secretion from islets exposed to elevated glucose levels. Both [Ca 2+ ] i and insulin were oscillatory during application of 10 mM glucose with temporal and quantitative profiles similar to what has been observed elsewhere. In previous work sinusoidal glucose levels have been used to test the entrainment of islets while monitoring either [Ca 2+ ] i or insulin levels, using this newly developed system, we show unambiguously that oscillations of both [Ca 2+ ] i and insulin release are entrained to oscillatory glucose levels and that the temporal correlation of these are maintained throughout the experiment. It is expected that the developed analytical system can be expanded to investigate a number of other intracellular messengers in islets, or other stimulus-secretion pathways in different cells.

We show that adult-born neurons form functional synapses on CA3 pyramidal neurons as early as 2 weeks after birth, and that this projection to the CA3 area becomes stable by 4 weeks in age. Newborn neurons at this age exhibit enhanced plasticity compared to other stages. Notably, we found that reversibly silencing this cohort of ~4 week-old cells after training, but not cells of other ages, substantially disrupted retrieval of hippocampal memory.

Materials and Methods Ten early glottic cancer patients were treated with carotid sparing IMRT. For each patient, the conventional LAFT plan was developed for comparison. IMRT and LAFT plans were compared in terms of planning target volume (PTV) coverage, conformity index, homogeneity index, and the doses to planning organ at risk volume (PRV) for carotid arteries, spinal cord and pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Results Recurrence was not observed in any patients during the follow-up period. V 95% for PTV showed no significant difference between IMRT and LAFT plans, while V 100% was significantly higher in the IMRT plan (95.5% vs. 94.6%, p = 0.005).

0.701898518,29114909,An Ancestry Based Approach for Detecting Interactions,"  Background:  Epistasis and gene-environment interactions are known to contribute significantly to variation of complex phenotypes in model organisms. However, their identification in human association studies remains challenging for myriad reasons. In the case of epistatic interactions, the large number of potential interacting sets of genes presents computational, multiple hypothesis correction, and other statistical power issues. In the case of gene-environment interactions, the lack of consistently measured environmental covariates in most disease studies precludes searching for interactions and creates difficulties for replicating studies.    Results:  In this work, we develop a new statistical approach to address these issues that leverages genetic ancestry, defined as the proportion of ancestry derived from each ancestral population (e.g. the fraction of European/African ancestry in African Americans), in admixed populations. We applied our method to gene expression and methylation data from African American and Latino admixed individuals respectively, identifying nine interactions that were significant at p < 5 √ó 10 ‚àí8 . We show that two of the interactions in methylation data replicate, and the remaining six are significantly enriched for low p-values ( p < 1.8 √ó 10 ‚àí6 ).    Conclusion:  We show that genetic ancestry can be a useful proxy for unknown and unmeasured covariates in the search for interaction effects. These results have important implications for our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits.  ",Genetic epidemiology,POPGENE

The prophylactic administration of 0.1% AA-CUR/PVP-BA significantly decreased S . Enteritidis colonization in cecal tonsils (CT) when compared to the positive control group (PC, p < 0.05). The therapeutic administration of 0.1% AA-CUR/PVP-BA significantly reduced the concentration of S .

0.24466569,27313781,TERT  Core Promotor Mutations in Early-Onset Bladder Cancer,"Activating mutations in the core promoter of the TERT gene have been described in many different tumor entities. In vitro models showed a two- to fourfold increase in transcriptional activity of the TERT promoter through creation of a consensus binding motif for Ets/TCF transcription factors caused by these mutations. TERT core promoter mutations are the most common mutations in bladder cancer with a frequency between 55.6% and 82.8% described so far, and are independent of stage and grade. Since limited data on molecular alterations of early-onset bladder tumors exists, we assessed the frequency of TERT core promoter mutations in early-onset bladder cancer. Two cohorts of bladder tumors (early-onset patient group; n=144 (age of onset of disease ‚â§45 years); unselected, consecutive group; n=125) were examined for TERT core promoter mutations. After microdissection and extraction of DNA the corresponding hotspot regions in the TERT core promoter were examined by Sanger-sequencing or a SNaPshot approach. A significantly lower frequency of TERT core promoter mutations was found in tumors from the early-onset cohort compared to the consecutive cohort (57.6% vs. 84.8%, p<0.001). Among the early-onset cohort cases younger than the cohort's median age of 39 years at disease onset showed a significantly reduced number of TERT promoter mutations (31/67, 46,3%) than cases aged between 39 and 45 years (52/77, 67.5%; p=0.012). This association was not found in the consecutive cases. Mutation status was independent of tumor stage and grade. We conclude that in tumors from early-onset bladder cancer patients TERT core promoter mutations are not as frequent as in bladder tumors from consecutive cases, but seem to play an important role there as well. In patients below 39 years of age TERT core promoter mutations are a more infrequent event, suggesting different mechanisms of tumorigenesis in these young patients.",Journal of Cancer,ONCO

The present study was conducted to determine the content and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of starch in different grain legume cultivars for pigs by means of both a polarimetric and enzymatic method for starch determination. Methods Three experiments were conducted with six barrows each which were fitted with ileal T-cannulas. In total, 18 diets including six different cultivars of faba beans ( Vicia faba L .) and peas ( Pisum sativum L. ), five different cultivars of lupins ( Lupinus luteus L. , Lupinus angustifolius L. ), and one diet with a soybean meal (SBM) were fed. Results The starch content of faba beans and peas was greater ( P <‚Äâ0.05) when determined polarimetrically than enzymatically (438 vs. 345¬†g/kg dry matter (DM) in faba beans and 509 vs. 390¬†g/kg DM in peas, respectively). Considerable lower starch contents were obtained in lupins and SBM, with 82 and 48¬†g/kg DM (analyzed polarimetrically) and <1.1 and 3¬†g/kg DM (analyzed enzymatically), respectively. Mean values for contents of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in grain legumes ranged from 111 and 79¬†g/kg DM in peas to 248 and 207¬†g/kg DM in lupins, respectively. Contents of condensed tannins in the colored flowered faba bean cultivars ranged from 2.1 to 7.4¬†g/kg DM. The AID of starch was greater ( P <‚Äâ0.05) in pea than in faba bean cultivars, and using the polarimetric starch determination method resulted in greater ( P <‚Äâ0.05) digestibility values than using enzymatic starch analysis (84 vs. 80% in faba beans and 86 vs. 83% in peas). Moreover, AID of starch differed ( P <‚Äâ0.05) within pea cultivars and starch digestibility in faba beans decreased linearly ( P <‚Äâ0.05) as the content of condensed tannins increased. However, there was no relationship between contents of NDF and ADF and AID of starch in pea and faba bean cultivars. Conclusion Both contents and AID of starch in grain legumes can vary as influenced by the analytical method used for starch determination. Generally, starch digestibility is greater when measured by polarimetric rather than enzymatic methods.",Journal of animal science and biotechnology,ANIMAL
0.612137984,27016222,Use of comprehensive genomic profiling to direct point-of-care management of patients with gynecologic cancers,"  OBJECTIVE  To determine the feasibility and clinical utility of using comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in the course of clinical care to identify clinically relevant tumor genomic alterations for patients with either rare or refractory gynecologic cancers to facilitate point-of-care management. Use of an expert, multidisciplinary, institutional molecular tumor board (MTB) assessment is discussed regarding input on putative targeted options for individualized therapy.    METHODS  A prospective clinical trial is ongoing. We report on the initial 69 patients with gynecologic cancers that were either rare or refractory to standard therapy. CGP was performed by Foundation Medicine, Inc. Genomic alterations were reviewed by members of an MTB. Consensus recommendations on genomically targeted, FDA-approved, on- and off-label therapies and clinical trials were sent to the treating physician, and decisions and outcomes were assessed.    RESULTS  Study outcomes were available for 64 patients. The mean number of genes altered per tumor was 4.97 (median=4; range, 1‚Äì26), and the average turnaround time from testing laboratory report to generation of formal recommendations was approximately three weeks. Evaluation of genomic and clinical data by the MTB led to generation of targeted treatment options in all 64 patients, and the percentage of patients for whom one or more of these recommendations were implemented by the treating physician was 39%. Seventy percent of the patients receiving targeted therapy based on a CGP result experienced radiologic response or showed evidence of clinical benefit or stable disease.    CONCLUSION  These data suggest that an institutional MTB is a feasible venue for reviewing tumor genomic profiling results and generating clinical recommendations. These data also support the need for further studies and guidelines on clinical decision making with greater availability of broad genomically based diagnostics.  ",Gynecologic oncology,ONCO
0.363279421,30069149,Experimental Control of Turbulent Boundary Layers with In-plane Travelling Waves,"The experimental control of turbulent boundary layers using streamwise travelling waves of spanwise wall velocity, produced using a novel active surface, is outlined in this paper. The innovative surface comprises a pneumatically actuated compliant structure based on the kagome lattice geometry, supporting a pre-tensioned membrane skin. Careful design of the structure enables waves of variable length and speed to be produced in the flat surface in a robust and repeatable way, at frequencies and amplitudes known to have a favourable influence on the boundary layer. Two surfaces were developed, a preliminary module extending 152 mm in the streamwise direction, and a longer one with a fetch of 2.9 m so that the boundary layer can adjust to the new surface condition imposed by the forcing. With a shorter, 1.5 m portion of the surface actuated, generating an upstream-travelling wave, a drag reduction of 21.5 % was recorded in the boundary layer with R e œÑ =‚Äâ1125. At the same flow conditions, a downstream-travelling produced a much smaller drag reduction of 2.6 % , agreeing with the observed trends in current simulations. The drag reduction was determined with constant temperature hot-wire measurements of the mean velocity gradient in the viscous sublayer, while simultaneous laser Doppler vibrometer measurements of the surface recorded the wall motion. Despite the mechanics of the dynamic surface resulting in some out-of-plane motion (which is small in comparison to the in-plane streamwise movement), the positive drag reduction results are encouraging for future investigations at higher Reynolds numbers.","Flow, turbulence and combustion",ENG
0.172506107,16766443,Mood-congruent free recall bias in anxious individuals is not a consequence of response bias," The status of mood-congruent free recall bias in anxious individuals was evaluated following incidental encoding of target words. Individuals with high and low levels of trait anxiety completed a modified Stroop task, which revealed an attentional bias for threat-related stimuli in anxious individuals. This group was significantly slower in naming the colour in which threat-related words were displayed compared to neutral words. In a subsequent free recall test for the words used in the modified Stroop task, anxious individuals recalled more threat-related words compared to low-anxious people. This difference was significant even when controlling for the false recall of items that had not been presented during study. These results support the view put forward by Russo, Fox, Bellinger, and Nguyen-Van-Tam (2001) that mood-congruent free recall bias in anxious individuals can be observed if the target material is encoded at a relatively shallow level. Moreover, contrary to Dowens and Calvo (2003) , the current results show that the memory advantage for threat-related information in anxious individuals is not a consequence of response bias.

Resting state studies in ASC have identified reduced connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), which includes mPFC, suggesting that other resting state networks incorporating ‚Äòsocial‚Äô brain regions may also be abnormal. Using Seed-based Connectivity and Group Independent Component Analysis (ICA) approaches, we looked at resting functional connectivity in ASC between specific ‚Äòsocial‚Äô brain regions, as well as within and between whole networks incorporating these regions. We found reduced functional connectivity within the DMN in individuals with ASC, using both ICA and seed-based approaches. Two further networks identified by ICA, the salience network, incorporating the insula and a medial temporal lobe network, incorporating the amygdala, showed reduced inter-network connectivity. This was underlined by reduced seed-based connectivity between the insula and amygdala. The results demonstrate significantly reduced functional connectivity within and between resting state networks incorporating ‚Äòsocial‚Äô brain regions. This reduced connectivity may result in difficulties in communication and integration of information across these networks, which could contribute to the impaired processing of social signals in ASC.",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,NEURO
0.323787849,26873781,Is the Crowd Better as an Assistant or a Replacement in Ontology Engineering? An Exploration Through the Lens of the Gene Ontology," Biomedical ontologies contain errors. Crowdsourcing, defined as taking a job traditionally performed by a designated agent and outsourcing it to an undefined large group of people, provides scalable access to humans. Therefore, the crowd has the potential overcome the limited accuracy and scalability found in current ontology quality assurance approaches. Crowd-based methods have identified errors in SNOMED CT, a large, clinical ontology, with an accuracy similar to that of experts, suggesting that crowdsourcing is indeed a feasible approach for identifying ontology errors. This work uses that same crowd-based methodology, as well as a panel of experts, to verify a subset of the Gene Ontology (200 relationships). Experts identified 16 errors, generally in relationships referencing acids and metals. The crowd performed poorly in identifying those errors, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.44 to 0.73, depending on the methods configuration. However, when the crowd verified what experts considered to be easy relationships with useful definitions, they performed reasonably well. Notably, there are significantly fewer Google search results for Gene Ontology concepts than SNOMED CT concepts. This disparity may account for the difference in performance ‚Äì fewer search results indicate a more difficult task for the worker. The number of Internet search results could serve as a method to assess which tasks are appropriate for the crowd. These results suggest that the crowd fits better as an expert assistant, helping experts with their verification by completing the easy tasks and allowing experts to focus on the difficult tasks, rather than an expert replacement.

0.859446743,20836896,Genetic transformation of lignin degrading fungi facilitated by  Agrobacterium tumefaciens,"Background White-rot fungi are primarily the major degraders of lignin, a major obstacle for commercial exploitation of plant byproducts to produce bioethanol and other industrially important products. However, to improve their efficacy for lignin degradation, it has become necessary to genetically modify these organisms using appropriate vectors. Agrobacterium tumefaciens , a soil phytopathogenic bacterium, generally transforms plants by delivering a portion of the resident Ti- plasmid, the T-DNA (transfer DNA). The trans-Kingdom gene transfer is initiated by the activity of Ti-plasmid encoded vir (virulence) genes in response to low-molecular-mass phenolic compounds such as acetosyringone. A. tumefaciens played a major role in plant genetic engineering and basic research in molecular biology, accounting for nearly 80% of the transgenic plants produced so far. Initially, it was believed that only dicotyledons, gymnosperms and a few monocotyledonous species could be transformed by this bacterium; but recent reports have totally changed this scenario by demonstrating that many 'recalcitrant' species not included in its natural host range can also be transformed, especially filamentous fungi. Results This paper describes an efficient and convenient Agrobacterium -mediated gene transformation system for successful delivery of T-DNA, carrying the genes coding for Œ≤-glucuronidase ( uidA ), green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) and hygromycin phosphotransferase ( hpt ) to the nuclear genome of lignin degrading white-rot fungi such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium , Ganoderma sp. RCKK-02, Pycnoporous cinnabarinus , Crinipellis sp. RCK-1, Pleurotus sajor-caju and fungal isolate BHR-UDSC without supplementation of acetosyringone. The fungal transformants were confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization. The expression vector pCAMBIA 1304-RCKK was constructed by the addition of GPD promoter from plasmid p416 to the binary vector backbone pCAMBIA1304, which controls uidA and gfp gene. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) analysis revealed the attachment of bacterial cells to the fungal hyphae. Transformation frequency varied from 50 to 75% depending on the fungal species used in this study. The transformation efficiency was maximum at 20¬∞C whereas no transfer was observed at temperature above 29¬∞C. Conclusion These findings provide a rapid and reproducible transformation method without external addition of acetosyringone, which could be useful for improving white-rot fungi for their various biotechnological applications.",BMC biotechnology,ENG
0.87004262,23661152,High life in the sky? Mortality by floor of residence in Switzerland,"Living in high-rise buildings could influence the health of residents. Previous studies focused on structural features of high-rise buildings or characteristics of their neighbourhoods, ignoring differences within buildings in socio-economic position or health outcomes. We examined mortality by floor of residence in the Swiss National Cohort, a longitudinal study based on the linkage of December 2000 census with mortality and emigration records 2001‚Äì2008. Analyses were based on 1.5 million people living in buildings with four or more floors and 142,390 deaths recorded during 11.4 million person-years of follow-up. Cox models were adjusted for age, sex, civil status, nationality, language, religion, education, professional status, type of household and crowding. The rent per m 2 increased with higher floors and the number of persons per room decreased. Mortality rates decreased with increasing floors: hazard ratios comparing the ground floor with the eighth floor and above were 1.22 [95¬†% confidence interval (CI) 1.15‚Äì1.28] for all causes, 1.40 (95¬†% CI 1.11‚Äì1.77) for respiratory diseases, 1.35 (95¬†% CI 1.22‚Äì1.49) for cardiovascular diseases and 1.22 (95¬†% CI 0.99‚Äì1.50) for lung cancer, but 0.41 (95¬†% CI 0.17‚Äì0.98) for suicide by jumping from a high place. There was no association with suicide by any means (hazard ratio 0.81; 95¬†% CI 0.57‚Äì1.15). We conclude that in Switzerland all-cause and cause-specific mortality varies across floors of residence among people living in high-rise buildings. Gradients in mortality suggest that floor of residence captures residual socioeconomic stratification and is likely to be mediated by behavioural (e.g. physical activity), and environmental exposures, and access to a method of suicide.

0.095067375,26683900,Estimation of coronary wave intensity analysis using non-invasive techniques and its application to exercise physiology,"  Introduction  Wave intensity analysis (WIA) has found particular applicability in the coronary circulation where it can quantify travelling waves that accelerate and decelerate blood flow. The most important wave for the regulation of flow is the backward-travelling decompression wave (BDW). Coronary WIA has hitherto always been calculated from invasive measures of pressure and flow. However, recently it has become feasible to obtain estimates of these waveforms non-invasively. In this study we set out to assess the agreement between invasive and non-invasive coronary WIA at rest and measure the effect of exercise.    Method and Results  22 patients (mean age 60) with unobstructed coronaries underwent invasive WIA in the Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD). Immediately afterwards, non-invasive LAD flow and pressure were recorded and WIA calculated from pulsed-wave Doppler coronary flow velocity and central blood pressure waveforms measured using a cuff-based technique. Nine of these patients underwent non-invasive coronary WIA assessment during exercise.  A pattern of 6 waves were observed in both modalities. The BDW was similar between invasive and non-invasive measures (peak: 14.9¬±7.8 vs ‚àí13.8¬±7.1√ó10 4 Wm ‚àí2 s ‚àí2 , concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) 0.73, p<0.01; cumulative ‚àí64.4¬±32.8 vs ‚àí59.4¬±34.2√ó10 2 Wm ‚àí2 s ‚àí1 , CCC 0.66, p<0.01), but smaller waves were underestimated non-invasively. Increased left ventricular mass correlated with a decreased non-invasive BDW fraction (r=‚àí0.48, p=0.02). Exercise increased the BDW: at maximum exercise peak BDW was ‚àí47.0¬±29.5√ó10 4 Wm ‚àí2 s ‚àí2 (p<0.01 vs rest) and cumulative BDW ‚àí19.2¬±12.6√ó10 3 Wm ‚àí2 s ‚àí1 (p<0.01 vs rest).    Conclusion  The BDW can be measured non-invasively with acceptable reliably potentially simplifying assessments and increasing the applicability of coronary WIA.  ",American journal of physiology.

0.187869952,30417098,The optimal mating distance resulting from heterosis and genetic incompatibility,"Offspring are fittest when parents are genetically neither too close nor too distant from each other. Theory predicts that the fitness of an individual is maximized when the genetic distance between its parents (i.e., mating distance) is neither too small nor too large. However, decades of research have generally failed to validate this prediction or identify the optimal mating distance (OMD). Respectively analyzing large numbers of crosses of fungal, plant, and animal model organisms, we indeed find the hybrid phenotypic value a humped quadratic polynomial function of the mating distance for the vast majority of fitness-related traits examined, with different traits of the same species exhibiting similar OMDs. OMDs are generally slightly greater than the nucleotide diversities of the species concerned but smaller than the observed maximal intraspecific genetic distances. Hence, the benefit of heterosis is at least partially offset by the harm of genetic incompatibility even within species. These results have multiple theoretical and practical implications for speciation, conservation, and agriculture.",Science advances,ECO
0.497033783,20964322,On-Plate Desalting and SALDI-MS Analysis of Peptides with Hydrophobic Silicate Nanofilms on a Gold Substrate," We report the use of silicate nanofilms for on-plate desalting and subsequently direct laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometric (LDI-MS) analysis of peptides. A hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) monolayer is formed on a calcinated nanofilm on a gold substrate to facilitate sample deposition and interaction with the surface that allows effective removal of MS-incompatible contaminants such as salts and surfactants by simple on-plate washing while the peptides are retained on the spot. By eliminating interferences from matrix-related ions and contaminants, sensitivity of MS analysis has been enhanced over ca. 20 times, leading to improved detection of peptides at the low-fmol level. A high recovery rate of the peptides is obtained by using relatively rough nanofilms, which are prepared through a modified layer-by-layer (LbL)-deposition/calcination process. The performance of the films has been investigated with peptide samples in the presence of high salts (NaCl and sodium acetate) and urea. Compared to MALDI analysis with CHCA-matrix, LDI with on-plate desalting offers marked improvement for analysis of peptides due to low background ions and reduction of sample complexity. Additionally, selective capture of the hydrophobic components of a protein can be achieved, providing a highly useful strategy for specific peptide enrichment. LDI with on-plate desalting approach has also been successfully applied to peptide analysis from protein digests. ",Analytical chemistry,CHEM

Here we present a method to distinguish the individual contributions to the changes of the excitation, radiative and non-radiative rate and use this information to determine the quantum yields for single molecules. The method is validated by precisely placing single fluorescent dyes with respect to gold nanoparticles as well as with respect to the excitation polarization using DNA origami nanostructures. Following validation, measurements in zeromode waveguides reveal that suppression of the radiative rate and enhancement of the non-radiative rate lead to a reduced quantum yield. Because the method exploits the intrinsic blinking of dyes, it can generally be applied to fluorescence measurements in arbitrary nanophotonic environments.",Nature communications,CHEM

To unveil the role of the cocatalyst interconnected to the photoanode, we performed impedance measurements. According to the one order of magnitude higher value for the capacitance associated with surface states ( C SS ) compared to the bare photoanode, the function of the catalyst‚àíphotoanode interface resembles that of a p‚àín-like junction. In addition, the charge transfer resistance associated with charge transfer processes from surface states ( R ct,ss ) was unchanged at potentials between 0.8 and 1.1 V RHE after adding the cocatalyst, indicating that the catalyst has a negligible effect on the hole transport to the electrolyte.

Cross-sectional data employed in this study came from the fifth wave of the German Ageing Survey ( n = 5048), a nationally representative sample comprising non-institutionalized individuals aged 40 and above. A single-item measure was used to quantify self-rated health (ranging from 1 = very good to 5 = very bad). An established scale developed by Bude and Lantermann was used to assess social exclusion. Moreover, individuals reported the frequency of work in the garden (daily; several times a week; once a week; 1-3 times a month; less often; never). Poorer self-rated health was associated with feelings of social exclusion. The frequency of gardening significantly moderated the association between these factors in women. This cross-sectional study emphasizes the moderating role of gardening in the relation between self-rated health and social exclusion in women.

0.765323922,23945354,Transport Response is a filial-specific behavioral response to maternal carrying in C57BL/6 mice,"Background A mother carries her young in many altricial mammals, such as cats, lions, rats and mice. During maternal carrying, the transported young assume a compact posture. We have recently shown that, in both humans and mice, the carried infants immediately calmed down and showed reductions in heart rate, distress vocalizations, and voluntary movement. The loss of the calming response in mouse pups hindered maternal retrieval efficacy. These findings suggested that the infant calming response functioned to reduce the maternal burden of carrying and was therefore conserved in a variety of mammalian species. However, it remains unclear how and when each component of this calming response develops and whether it is a filial-specific behavior. Results We dissected various components of the carrying-induced responses in mouse pups, collectively called the ‚ÄúTransport Response‚Äù herein. We showed that during the second postnatal week, pups exhibited characteristic compact posture with limb ventroflexion. The body trunk remained paradoxically pliable, suggesting complex neural regulation throughout the body. Pups also showed an increased pain tolerance to a tail pinch during the Transport Response. Analyses of the developmental courses of distinct components of the Transport Response revealed the independent regulation of each component: in the first postnatal week, the cessation of ultrasonic vocalizations was exhibited prominently; in the second postnatal week, immobilization reached its peak; and toward the third postnatal week, the postural component became fully matured. At the end of the third postnatal week, when the pups are able to transport by themselves, the pups no longer exhibited the Transport Response. Conclusions This study has revealed the mouse Transport Response as a complex set of behavioral and physiological components, each of which has a specific postnatal time window but is orchestrated in a well-matched manner with the maturation of ambulatory ability in the pups. These findings collectively indicate that the Transport Response is a filial-specific, innate behavioral reaction and is distinct from a simple reflex or defensive freezing response. The Transport Response could be a novel index of primitive filial attachment behaviors, acting to smooth mother-infant interaction.",Frontiers in zoology,ANIMAL

NO production and mononuclear cell expression of the NO producing enzyme-inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) have been associated with protection from severe falciparum malaria. The purpose of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the NOS2 promoter, to identify associations of these haplotypes with malaria severity and to test the effects of these polymorphisms on promoter activity. We identified 34 SNPs in the proximal 7.3 kb region of the NOS2 promoter and inferred NOS2 promoter haplotypes based on genotyping 24 of these SNPs in a population of Tanzanian children with and without cerebral malaria. We identified 71 haplotypes; 24 of these haplotypes comprised 82% of the alleles. We determined whether NOS2 promoter haplotypes were associated with malaria severity in two groups of subjects from Dar es Salaam ( N = 185 and N = 250) and in an inception cohort of children from Muheza-Tanga, Tanzania ( N = 883). We did not find consistent associations of NOS2 promoter haplotypes with malaria severity or malarial anemia, although interpretation of these results was potentially limited by the sample size of each group. Furthermore, cytokine-induced NOS2 promoter activity determined using luciferase reporter constructs containing the proximal 7.3 kb region of the NOS2 promoter and the G-954C or C-1173T SNPs did not differ from NOS2 promoter constructs that lacked these polymorphisms. Taken together, these studies suggest that the relationship between NOS2 promoter polymorphisms and malaria severity is more complex than previously described. ",Human genetics,POPGENE

Networks are particularly vulnerable in hostile environments because of many factors, such as uncertain mobility, limitations on computation, and the need for storage in mobile nodes. Though some location-based security mechanisms can resist some malicious attacks, they are only suitable for static networks and may sometimes require large amounts of storage. To solve these problems, using location information, which is one of the most important properties in outdoor wireless networks, a security mechanism called a moving security area (MSA) is proposed to resist malicious attacks by using mobile nodes‚Äô dynamic location-based keys. The security mechanism is layered by performing different detection schemes inside or outside the MSA.

While reports of regional connectivity patterns based on individual methods are becoming common, studies comparing the results of two or more connectivity-mapping methods remain rare. In this study, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation during PET imaging (TMS/PET), a stimulation-based method, and meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), a task-based method to map the connectivity patterns of the supplementary motor area (SMA). Further, we drew upon the behavioral domain meta-data of the BrainMap¬Æ database to characterize the behavioral domain specificity of two maps. Both MACM and TMS/PET detected multi-synaptic connectivity patterns, with the MACM-detected connections being more extensive. Both MACM and TMS/PET detected connections belonging to multiple behavioral domains, including action, cognition and perception. Finally, we show that the two connectivity-mapping methods are complementary in that, the MACM informed on the functional nature of SMA connections, while TMS/PET identified brain areas electrophysiologically connected with the SMA. Thus, we demonstrate that integrating multimodal database and imaging techniques can derive comprehensive connectivity maps of brain areas. ",NeuroImage,NEURO
0.971626315,25546417,Gene Conversion between Cationic Trypsinogen ( PRSS1 ) and the Pseudogene Trypsinogen 6 ( PRSS3P2 ) in Patients with Chronic Pancreatitis," Mutations of the human cationic trypsinogen gene ( PRSS1 ) are frequently found in association with hereditary pancreatitis. The most frequent variants p.N29I and p.R122H are recognized as disease-causing mutations. Three pseudogene paralogs in the human trypsinogen family, including trypsinogen 6 ( PRSS3P2 ), carry sequence variations in exon 3 which mimic the p.R122H mutation. In routine genetic testing of patients with chronic pancreatitis we identified in two unrelated individuals similar gene conversion events of 24‚Äì71 nucleotides length between exon 3 of the PRSS1 (acceptor) and PRSS3P2 (donor) genes. The converted allele resulted in three non-synonymous alterations c.343T>A (p.S115T), c.347G>C (p.R116P) and c.365_366delinsAT (p.R122H). Functional analysis of the conversion triple mutant revealed markedly increased autoactivation resulting in high and sustained trypsin activity in the presence of chymotrypsin C. This activation phenotype was identical to that of the p.R122H mutant. In addition, cellular secretion of the triple mutant from transfected HEK 293T cells was increased about two-fold and this effect was attributable to mutation p.R116P. Our observations confirm and extend the notion that recombination events between members of the trypsinogen family can generate high risk PRSS1 alleles. The pathogenic phenotype of the novel conversion is explained by a unique combination of increased trypsinogen activation and secretion. ",Human mutation,POPGENE
0.529855485,28740357,Diffusion of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) through a high density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane," The new applications for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in various fields and consequently their greater production volume have increased their potential release to the environment. Landfills are one of the major locations where carbon nanotubes are expected to be disposed and it is important to ensure that they can limit the release of CNTs. Diffusion of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) dispersed in an aqueous media through a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane (as a part of the landfill barrier system) was examined. Based on the laboratory tests, the permeation coefficient was estimated to be less than 5.1√ó10 ‚àí15 m 2 /s. The potential performance of a HDPE geomembrane and geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) as parts of a composite liner in containing MWCNTs was modelled for six different scenarios. The results suggest that the low value of permeation coefficient of an HDPE geomembrane makes it an effective diffusive barrier for MWCNTs and by keeping the geomembrane defects to minimum during the construction (e.g., number of holes and length of wrinkles) a composite liner commonly used in municipal solid waste landfills will effectively contain MWCNTs.

Here we report the 3.2 √Ö crystal structure of Kluyveromyces Argonaute ( Kp AGO) fortuitously complexed with guide RNA originating from small-RNA duplexes autonomously loaded and processed by recombinant Kp AGO. Despite their diverse sequences, guide-RNA nucleotides 1‚Äì8 are positioned similarly, with sequence-independent contacts to bases, phosphates and 2‚Ä≤-hydroxyl groups pre-organizing the backbone of nucleotides 2‚Äì8 in a near‚ÄìA-form conformation. Compared with prokaryotic Argonautes, Kp AGO has numerous surface-exposed insertion segments, with a cluster of conserved insertions repositioning the N domain to enable full propagation of guide‚Äìtarget pairing. Compared with Argonautes in inactive conformations, Kp AGO has a hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes an expanded and repositioned loop, which inserts an invariant glutamate into the catalytic pocket. Mutation analyses and analogies to Ribonuclease H indicate that insertion of this glutamate finger completes a universally conserved catalytic tetrad, thereby activating Argonaute for RNA cleavage.

The present study was designed to determine temporal changes in the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes and associated factors in Kuwaiti adults. Methods Data analysis from the nationally representative cross-sectional Kuwait National Nutrition Surveillance System. 2745 males and 3611 females, aged 20‚Äì69 years, attending registration for employment or pensions and Hajj Pilgrimage health check-ups or accompanying children for immunizations from 2002 through 2009 were participated. Socio-demographic and lifestyle information, height and weight, and blood samples were collected. Results During the 8 years (2002‚Äì09), prevalences of IFG in males and females decreased by 7.4% and 6.8% and of diabetes by 9.8% and 8.9% in males and females, respectively. Linear regression for blood glucose level with time, adjusted for age, BMI, blood cholesterol and education level, showed a greater decrease in males than females (1.12 vs 0.93 mmol/L); males also showed an increase in 2002‚Äì2003 followed by a marked decrease in 2006‚Äì2007 while females showed a significant decrease in 2008‚Äì2009. Both males and females showed the largest decrease in the 2 nd half of the study accounting for the majority of the overall decrease (1.13 mmol/L for males and 0.87 mmol/l for females for the 4 years). Compared with 2002‚Äì03, the OR for IFG in males decreased with time, and becoming significantly lower (OR=0.32; 95% CI: 0.21-0.49) for 2008‚Äì09. In females, the OR for IFG decreased significantly with time, except in 2006‚Äì07. Similarly, the OR for diabetes in males decreased to 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24-0.49) and in females to 0.33 (95% CI: 0.22-0.50) in 2008‚Äì09. For both genders, age and BMI were independently positively associated with IFG and diabetes, while education levels and smoking were negatively associated with IFG and diabetes. No significant association was found for either hypercholesterolemia or exercise in either gender. Conclusion Continued monitoring of blood glucose is needed to see if negative trends observed in 2008‚Äì2009 endure and further research of contributing factors is required for development of targeted intervention strategies.",BMC public health,EPIDEM

0.028194952,24803134,Radial Modulation Contrast Imaging Using a 20-MHz Single-Element Intravascular Ultrasound Catheter," Contrast-enhanced intravascular ultrasound imaging is a promising tool for the characterization of coronary vasa vasorum proliferation, which has been identified as a marker of, and possible etiologic factor in, the development of high-risk atherosclerotic plaques. Resonance-based nonlinear detection methods have required the development of prototype catheters which are not commercially available, thus limiting clinical translation. In this study, we investigated the performances of a radial modulation imaging approach (25/3 MHz combination) using simulations, implemented it on a clinical 20-MHz rotating catheter, and tested it in a wall-less tissue-mimicking flow phantom perfused with lipid-encapsulated microbubbles (MBs). The effects of the phase lag, low-frequency pressure, and MB concentration on the envelope subtracted radial modulation signals were investigated as a function of depth. Our dual-pulse dual-frequency approach produced contrast-specific images with contrast-to-tissue improvements over B-mode of 15.1 ¬± 2.1 dB at 2 mm and 6.8 ¬± 0.1 dB at 4 mm depths. Using this imaging strategy, 200-Œºm-diameter cellulose tubing perfused with MBs could be resolved while surrounding tissue scattering was suppressed. These results raise promise for the detection of coronary vasa vasorum and may ultimately facilitate the detection of plaque at risk for rupture.

Although experienced anatomic tracers can be reliable, manual segmentation is a time consuming process and may not be feasible for large-scale neuroimaging studies. In this paper, we compare an automated method, FreeSurfer (V4), with a published manual protocol on the determination of hippocampal boundaries from MRI scans, using data from an existing MCI/AD cohort. To perform the comparison, we develop an enhanced spherical harmonic processing framework to model and register these hippocampal traces. The framework treats the two hippocampi as a single geometric configuration and extracts the positional, orientation and shape variables in a multi-object setting. We apply this framework to register manual tracing and FreeSurfer results together and the two methods show stronger agreement on position and orientation than shape measures. Work is in progress to examine a refined FreeSurfer segmentation strategy and an improved agreement on shape features is expected. ",Hippocampus,NEURO
0.965828758,16473021,Reliable identification of the auditory thalamus using multi-modal structural analyses," The medial geniculate body (MGB) of the thalamus is a key component of the auditory system. It is involved in relaying and transforming auditory information to the cortex and in top-down modulation of processing in the midbrain, brainstem, and ear. Functional imaging investigations of this region in humans, however, have been limited by the difficulty of distinguishing MGB from other thalamic nuclei. Here we introduce two methods for reliably delineating MGB anatomically in individuals based on conventional and diffusion MRI data. The first uses high resolution proton-density weighted scanning optimised for subcortical grey-white contrast. The second uses diffusion-weighted imaging and probabilistic tractography to automatically segment the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei from surrounding structures based on their distinctive patterns of connectivity to the rest of the brain. Both methods produce highly replicable results that are consistent with published atlases. Importantly, both methods rely on commonly available imaging sequences and standard hardware, a significant advantage over previously described approaches. In addition to providing useful approaches for identifying the MGB and LGN in vivo , our study offers further validation of diffusion tractography for the parcellation of grey matter regions on the basis of their connectivity patterns.

Therefore, the present study recommends future exploration on TF-based biomarkers for their potential as prognostic predictors. Overall, the highlights of this study are: i) This novel study pinpoints a TF panel for the robust prediction of renal cell carcinoma prognosis, and ii) the MYC-ESRRA-RFX5 panel is proposed as a signature for characterizing the immune microenvironment, and to potentially predict the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors.",Oncology letters,ONCO
0.656232611,22100814,Co-Learning Analysis of Two Perceptual Learning Tasks with Identical Input Stimuli Supports the Reweighting Hypothesis," Perceptual learning, even when it exhibits significant specificity to basic stimulus features such as retinal location or spatial frequency, may cause discrimination performance to improve either through enhancement of early sensory representations or through selective re-weighting of connections from the sensory representations to specific responses, or both. For most experiments in the literature ( Ahissar & Hochstein, 1996 , Fahle & Morgan, 1996 , Wilson, 1986 ), the two forms of plasticity make similar predictions ( Dosher & Lu, 2009 , Petrov, Dosher & Lu, 2005 ). The strongest test of the two hypotheses must use training and transfer tasks that rely on the same sensory representation with different task-dependent decision structures. If training changes sensory representations, transfer (or interference) must occur since the (changed) sensory representations are common. If instead training re-weights a separate set of task connections to decision, then performance in the two tasks may still be independent. Here, we performed a co-learning analysis of two perceptual learning tasks based on identical input stimuli, following a very interesting study of Fahle and Morgan (1996) who used nearly identical input stimuli (a three dot pattern) in training bisection and vernier tasks. Two important modifications were made: (1) identical input stimuli were used in the two tasks, and (2) subject practiced both tasks in multiple alternating blocks (800 trials/block). Two groups of subjects with counter-balanced order of training participated in the experiments. We found significant and independent learning of the two tasks.

In this work using atomic layer deposition we deposited a pinhole free nanometer-scale thin film oxide as a protective layer to prevent electrodes from corrosion, when applying high voltages (>20 V pp ) at the electrodes. Then, by exciting the electrodes at high frequency, we capacitively coupled the electrodes to the buffer in order to avoid electric field degradation and, hence, reduction in dielectrophoresis force due to the presence of the insulating oxide layer. To illustrate the functionality of our system, we demonstrated 100% detachment of anti-IgG and IgG bound beads (which is on the same order of magnitude in strength as typical antibody‚Äìantigen interactions) from the surface, upon applying the improved negative dielectrophoresis force. The significantly enhanced switching performance presented in this work shows orders of magnitude of improvement in on-to-off ratio and switching response time, without any need for chemical eluting agents, as compared to the previous work. The promising results from this work vindicates that the functionality of this singleplexed platform can be extended to perform a multiplexed bead-based assay where in a single channel an array of proteins are patterned each targeting a different antigen or protein.

Recently, proponents of the acceptance-based behavior therapy movement have further emphasized the importance of acceptance-based emotion regulation techniques. In order to directly compare these different emotion regulation strategies, 202 volunteers were asked to give an impromptu speech in front of a video camera. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The Reappraisal group was instructed to regulate their anxious arousal by reappraising the situation; the Suppression group was asked to suppress their anxious behaviors; and the Acceptance group was instructed to accept their anxiety. As expected, the Suppression group showed a greater increase in heart rate from baseline than the Reappraisal and Acceptance groups. Moreover, the Suppression group reported more anxiety than the Reappraisal group. However, the Acceptance and Suppression groups did not differ in their subjective anxiety response. These results suggest that both reappraising and accepting anxiety is more effective for moderating the physiological arousal than suppressing anxiety. However, reappraising is more effective for moderating the subjective feeling of anxiety than attempts to suppress or accept it. ",Behaviour research and therapy,PSYCH
0.572857518,27721527,Effect of Different Fluids on Rectified Motion of Leidenfrost Droplets on Micro/Sub-Micron Ratchets," Leidenfrost droplets, liquid droplets placed on a hot flat surface above the Leidenfrost temperature of the liquid, are an interesting model system to understand and achieve frictionless motion of droplets on a surface. Controlled unidirectional motion of otherwise random Leidenfrost droplets can be achieved by replacing the flat surface by a surface with topological ratchets. In this study, we show how an increase in the vapor layer thickness below the Leidenfrost droplet influences the droplet motion for underlying ratchets with various periods ranging from 1.5mm down to 800nm. This was exploited by systematically studying the Leidenfrost droplet motion of various liquids with low boiling points including acetone, isopropanol, and R134a on the aforementioned various ratchets. For all liquids with boiling points lower than water, no unidirectional motion was observed for 800 nm. This indicates that the asymmetric vapor flow beneath the Leidenfrost droplet becomes negligible due to the large vapor layer thickness relative to the ratchet depth. However, unidirectional droplet motion was still observed for the micron and millimeter scale ratchets even when the ratchet surface temperature was increased up to 360¬∞C and 230¬∞C for acetone and isopropanol, respectively. This can be attributed to the insulating property of the thick vapor layer which prevent the droplet from producing more vapor with increasing temperature. We also report the effect of the ratchet period on the droplet motion at room temperature using R134a droplets.   Graphical abstract    Leidenfrost droplets on ratchet surfaces show rectified droplet motion without friction at the droplet/ratchet interface. Here we investigated the Leidenfrost droplet motion on miniaturized ratchets with the ratchet periods ranging from 800 nm to 1.5 mm using different fluids.

0.882217555,16835395,Gene deletion reveals roles for annexin A1 in the regulation of lipolysis and IL-6 release in epididymal adipose tissue," In this study, epididymal adipose tissue from male annexin 1 (ANXA1)-null and wild-type control mice were used to explore the potential role of ANXA1 in adipocyte biology. ANXA1 was detected by Western blot analysis in wild-type tissue and localized predominantly to the stromal-vascular compartment. Epididymal fat pad mass was reduced by ANXA1 gene deletion, but adipocyte size was unchanged, suggesting that ANXA1 is required for the maintenance of adipocyte and/or preadipocyte cell number. Epididymal tissue from wild-type mice responded in vitro to noradrenaline and isoprenaline with increased glycerol release, reduced IL-6 release, and increased cAMP accumulation. Qualitatively similar but significantly attenuated responses to the catecholamines were observed in tissue from ANXA1-null mice, an effect that was not associated with changes in Œ≤-adrenoceptor mRNA expression. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also stimulated lipolysis in vitro, but its effects were muted by ANXA1 gene deletion. By contrast, LPS failed to influence IL-6 release from wild-type tissue but stimulated the release of the cytokine from tissue from ANXA1-null mice. ANXA1 gene deletion did not affect glucocorticoid receptor expression or the ability of dexamethasone to suppress catecholamine-induced lipolysis. It did, however, augment IL-6 expression and modify the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on IL-6 release. Collectively, these studies suggest that ANXA1 supports aspects of adipose tissue mass and alters the sensitivity of epididymal adipose tissue to catecholamines, glucocorticoids, and LPS, thereby modulating lipolysis and IL-6 release.

0.618061537,26345290,Inverse four-wave-mixing and self-parametric amplification effect in optical fibre," An important group of nonlinear processes in optical fibre involves the mixing of four waves due to the intensity dependence of the refractive index. It is customary to distinguish between nonlinear effects that require external/pumping waves (cross-phase modulation and parametric processes such as four-wave mixing) and self-action of the propagating optical field (self-phase modulation and modulation instability). Here, we present a new nonlinear self-action effect, self-parametric amplification (SPA), which manifests itself as optical spectrum narrowing in normal dispersion fibre, leading to very stable propagation with a distinctive spectral distribution. The narrowing results from an inverse four-wave mixing, resembling an effective parametric amplification of the central part of the spectrum by energy transfer from the spectral tails. SPA and the observed stable nonlinear spectral propagation with random temporal waveform can find applications in optical communications and high power fibre lasers with nonlinear intra-cavity dynamics.

Such data have also been used to estimate epidemiological parameters and to evaluate the effect of factors on infection dynamics. However, little is known about the extent of under‚Äêreporting in surveillance data, and thus of the true influenza incidence in the population.  Design: Through mathematical and statistical modelling, we analysed Italian epidemiological and virological surveillance data collected together with serological data derived from influenza vaccine clinical trials performed in Italy.  Results: Depending on the season, the reporting rate estimates ranged between 20% and 33% of the total incidence with higher reporting rates in seasons dominated by A/H3N2 virus. Despite a generally higher number of individuals immune against A/H3N2 viruses, effective reproduction ratios were quite similar in all seasons varying between 1¬∑2 and 1¬∑4. We observed an age‚Äêdependent transmissibility for different subtypes: susceptible children were more likely than susceptible adults and elderly to get infected when A/H1N1 or B strains were circulating, while no clear age‚Äêdependence was found for A/H3N2. We also perform sensitivity analysis under different assumptions for vaccine effectiveness, generation time (GT) and model variants; we found that the overall results in predicted patterns were extremely similar, with a slightly better fit obtained with shorter GTs.

To date, an assessment of immunologic factors relevant to disease has not been comprehensively performed for treatment na√Øve patients. We hypothesized that systemic immunologic biomarkers could predict overall survival (OS) in treatment na√Øve PDAC patients.    Methods  Peripheral blood was collected from 73 patients presenting with previously untreated metastatic PDAC. Extensive immunologic profiling was conducted to assess relationships between OS and the level of soluble plasma biomarkers or detailed immune cell phenotypes as measured by flow cytometry.    Results  Higher baseline levels of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 were strongly associated with poorer OS (p=0.008 and 0.026, respectively; HR=1.16 and 1.28, respectively), while higher levels of the monocyte chemoattractant MCP-1 were associated with significantly longer OS (p=0.045; HR=0.69). Patients with a greater proportion of antigen-experienced T cells (CD45RO + ) had longer OS (CD4 p=0.032; CD8 p=0.036; HR=0.36 and 0.61, respectively). While greater expression of the T cell checkpoint molecule CTLA-4 on CD8 + T cells was associated with significantly shorter OS (p=0.020; HR=1.53), the TIM3 molecule had a positive association with survival when expressed on CD4 + T cells (p=0.046; HR=0.62).    Conclusions  These data support the hypothesis that baseline immune status predicts PDAC disease course and overall patient survival.

Methods  HIV-seronegative, sexually active 18-24 year-old Kenyan men within a randomized trial of male circumcision provided penile exfoliated cells from two anatomical sites (glans/coronal sulcus, and shaft) at baseline. The GP5+/6+ PCR assay ascertained a wide range of HPV DNA types at the baseline visit. Risk of HIV infection [95% confidence interval (CI)] was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods, and hazard ratios (HR)[95% CI] from proportional hazards models.    Results  Among 2,168 uncircumcised men with baseline HPV data, 1,089 (50%) were HPV DNA positive. Cumulative incidence of HIV infection by 42-months was 5.8% [95% CI 3.6, 7.9] in men with HPV-positive glans specimens versus 3.7% [1.8, 5.6] in men with HPV-negative glans specimens (p=0.01). Controlling for subsequent circumcision status, baseline HSV-2 serostatus, and sexual and sociodemographic risk factors, the HR of HIV infection in men with HPV-positive glans specimens was 1.8 [1.1, 2.9] compared to men with HPV-negative glans specimens.    Conclusion  Results suggest an independent, increased risk of HIV seroconversion among HPV positive men. If confirmed in other studies, HPV prevention could be another tool for HIV prevention.

0.933760993,29350613,FGF mediated MAPK and PI3K/Akt Signals make distinct contributions to pluripotency and the establishment of Neural Crest,"Early vertebrate embryos possess cells with the potential to generate all embryonic cell types. While this pluripotency is progressively lost as cells become lineage restricted, Neural Crest cells retain broad developmental potential. Here, we provide novel insights into signals essential for both pluripotency and neural crest formation in Xenopus . We show that FGF signaling controls a subset of genes expressed by pluripotent blastula cells, and find a striking switch in the signaling cascades activated by FGF signaling as cells lose pluripotency and commence lineage restriction. Pluripotent cells display and require Map Kinase signaling, whereas PI3 Kinase/Akt signals increase as developmental potential is restricted, and are required for transit to certain lineage restricted states. Importantly, retaining a high Map Kinase/low Akt signaling profile is essential for establishing Neural Crest stem cells. These findings shed important light on the signal-mediated control of pluripotency and the molecular mechanisms governing genesis of Neural Crest.",eLife,BIOCHEM

There is no standard therapy for lateral epicondylitis. In Hong Kong, acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) have been popular in treating lateral epicondylitis in recent years. Objective This study is to compare the treatment effects of acupuncture and ESWT on lateral epicondylitis. Methods In this study, we evaluated 34 patients (34 elbows) with lateral epicondylitis. Seventeen patients were treated by 3-week ESWT, one session per week. Another 17 were treated by 3-week acupuncture therapy, two sessions per week. The outcome measures included pain score by visual analogue scale, maximum grip strength by Jamar dynamometer, and level of functional impairment by disability of arms, shoulders, and hands questionnaire. Participants were assessed at three time points: baseline; after treatment; and 2-week follow-up. Results The two treatments showed no significant difference at any assessment time-point. Both treatment groups had significant improvement in pain score in longitudinal comparisons. No significant difference was found in maximum grip strength and functional impairment in either treatment group, but a trend of improvement could be observed. In addition, improvement in pain relief stopped when treatment ended for either groups. Conclusions The treatment effects of acupuncture and ESWT on lateral epicondylitis were similar. The pain relief persisted for at least two weeks after treatment.","Asia-Pacific journal of sports medicine, arthroscopy, rehabilitation and technology",PHYSIO
0.409357312,22508766,Visual and Audiovisual Effects of Isochronous Timing on Visual Perception and Brain Activity,"Understanding how the brain extracts and combines temporal structure (rhythm) information from events presented to different senses remains unresolved. Many neuroimaging beat perception studies have focused on the auditory domain and show the presence of a highly regular beat (isochrony) in ‚Äúauditory‚Äù stimulus streams enhances neural responses in a distributed brain network and affects perceptual performance. Here, we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements of brain activity while healthy human participants performed a visual task on isochronous versus randomly timed ‚Äúvisual‚Äù streams, with or without concurrent task-irrelevant sounds. We found that visual detection of higher intensity oddball targets was better for isochronous than randomly timed streams, extending previous auditory findings to vision. The impact of isochrony on visual target sensitivity correlated positively with fMRI signal changes not only in visual cortex but also in auditory sensory cortex during audiovisual presentations. Visual isochrony activated a similar timing-related brain network to that previously found primarily in auditory beat perception work. Finally, activity in multisensory left posterior superior temporal sulcus increased specifically during concurrent isochronous audiovisual presentations. These results indicate that regular isochronous timing can modulate visual processing and this can also involve multisensory audiovisual brain mechanisms.","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",NEURO

Physicians are responsible for identifying the medical grounds for benefit claims. The aim of this study was to explore physicians' views on verifiability of medical conditions and related work ability in this context. Methods Information on verifiability of diagnostic categories and work ability was obtained from a survey among a representative sample of general practitioners (GPs) in Norway (n = 500, 25.2% response rate). Verifiability was defined as to what extent the assessment is based on objective criteria versus on information from the patient. We enquired about the diagnostic categories used in official statistics on main disability benefit causes in Norway and elsewhere. Results On a scale from 0 (low verifiability) to 5 (high verifiability), the mean level of verifiability across all diagnostic categories was 3.7 (SD = 0.42). Degree of verifiability varied much between diagnostic categories, and was low in e.g. unspecified rheumatism/myalgia and dorsopathies, and high in neoplasms and congenital malformations, deformation and chromosomal abnormalities. Verifiability of work ability was reported to be more problematic than that of diagnostic categories. The diagnostic categories rated as the least verifiable, are also the most common in disability pension awards. Conclusion Verifiability of both diagnostic categories and work ability in disability assessments are reported to be moderate by GPs. We suggest that the low verifiability of diagnostic categories and related work ability assessments in the majority of disability pension awards is important in explaining why GPs find the gatekeeping-function problematic.",BMC public health,EPIDEM
0.251438624,19940188,Brain Mechanisms Supporting Discrimination of Sensory Features of Pain: A New Model," Pain can be very intense or only mild, and can be well localized or diffuse. To date, little is known as to how such distinct sensory aspects of noxious stimuli are processed by the human brain. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a delayed match-to-sample task, we show that discrimination of pain intensity, a non-spatial aspect of pain, activates a ventrally directed pathway extending bilaterally from the insular cortex to the prefrontal cortex. This activation is distinct from the dorsally-directed activation of the posterior parietal cortex and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that occurs during spatial discrimination of pain. Both intensity and spatial discrimination tasks activate highly similar aspects of the anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting that this structure contributes to common elements of the discrimination task such as the monitoring of sensory comparisons and response selection. Taken together, these results provide the foundation for a new model of pain in which bidirectional dorsal and ventral streams preferentially amplify and process distinct sensory features of noxious stimuli according to top-down task demands.

This is because a precise localization of these nuclei is hampered by the limited contrast and sensitivity of conventional neuroimaging methods for deep brain nuclei. In this work, we used 7 Tesla multi-modal (T 2 -weighted and diffusion fractional anisotropy) 1.1 mm isotropic resolution MRI to achieve high sensitivity and contrast for single-subject brainstem and thalamic nuclei delineation. After precise coregistration to stereotactic space, we generated an in vivo human probabilistic atlas of auditory (medial geniculate nucleus, inferior colliculus, and superior olivary complex) and visual (lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus) subcortical nuclei.

Quantification of glycomic-profile changes is becoming increasingly important in the search for disease biomarkers. Here, we report a highly reproducible combination of a glycomic sample preparation/solid-phase derivatization of glycoprotein-derived N-linked glycans with their subsequent microchip-based separation and mass-spectrometric (MS) measurements. Following our previously-described reductive Œ≤-elimination for O-linked glycans with ammonia-borane complex to reduce N-linked structures, the N-linked alditol structures are effectively methylated in dimethylformamide medium to avoid artefacts in MS measurements. Reversed-phase microfluidic liquid chromatography (LC) of methylated N-linked oligosaccharide alditols resolved some closely related structures into regular retention increments, aiding in their structural assignments. Optimized LC gradients, together with nanospray MS, have been applied here in the quantitative measurements of N-linked glycans in blood serum, distinguishing breast cancer patients from control individuals.

0.328512033,28458764,"Working Memory Capacity, Mind Wandering, and Creative Cognition: An Individual-Differences Investigation into the Benefits of Controlled Versus Spontaneous Thought"," Should executive control, as indicated by working memory capacity (WMC) and mind-wandering propensity, help or hinder creativity? Sustained and focused attention should help guide a selective search of solution-relevant information in memory and help inhibit uncreative, yet accessible, ideas. However, unfocused attention and daydreaming should allow mental access to more loosely relevant concepts, remotely linked to commonplace solutions. Three individual-differences studies inserted incubation periods into one or two divergent thinking tasks and tested whether WMC (assessed by complex span tasks) and incubation-period mind wandering (assessed as probed reports of task-unrelated thought [TUT]) predicted post-incubation performance. Retrospective self-reports of Openness (Experiment 2) and mind-wandering and daydreaming propensity (Experiment 3) complemented our thought-probe assessments of TUT. WMC did not correlate with creativity in divergent thinking, whereas only the questionnaire measure of daydreaming, but not probed thought reports, weakly predicted creativity; the fact that in-the-moment TUTs did not correlate divergent creativity is especially problematic for claims that mind-wandering processes contribute to creative cognition. Moreover, the fact that WMC tends to strongly predict analytical problem solving and reasoning, but may not correlate with divergent thinking, provides a useful boundary condition for defining WMC‚Äôs nomological net. On balance, our data provide no support for either benefits or costs of executive control for at least one component of creativity. ","Psychology of aesthetics, creativity, and the arts",PSYCH
0.261898093,26089744,Compact representation of continuous energy surfaces for more efficient protein design," In macromolecular design, conformational energies are sensitive to small changes in atom coordinates, so modeling the small, continuous motions of atoms around low-energy wells confers a substantial advantage in structural accuracy; however, modeling these motions comes at the cost of a very large number of energy function calls, which form the bottleneck in the design calculation. In this work, we remove this bottleneck by consolidating all conformational energy evaluations into the precomputation of a local polynomial expansion of the energy about the ‚Äúideal‚Äù conformation for each low-energy, ‚Äúrotameric‚Äù state of each residue pair. This expansion is called E nergy as P olynomials in I nternal C oordinates (EPIC), where the internal coordinates can be sidechain dihedrals, backrub angles, and/or any other continuous degrees of freedom of a macromolecule, and any energy function can be used without adding any asymptotic complexity to the design. We demonstrate that EPIC efficiently represents the energy surface for both molecular-mechanics and quantum-mechanical energy functions, and apply it specifically to protein design to model both sidechain and backbone degrees of freedom.

The aim of the present work was to develop a functional RNA interference (RNAi) technique for Rhodnius prolixus , which could be widely used for functional genomics studies in triatomine bugs. To this end, we investigated whether double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can inhibit gene expression of R. prolixus salivary nitrophorin 2 (NP2) and what impact this might have on anticoagulant and apyrase activity in the saliva. dsRNA was introduced by two injections or by ingestion. RT-PCR of the salivary glands showed that injections of 15 Œºg of NP2 dsRNA in fourth-instar nymphs reduced gene expression by 75¬±14% and that feeding 1 Œºg/ŒºL of NP2 dsRNA into second-instar nymphs (approx. 13 Œºg in total) reduced gene expression by 42¬±10%. Phenotype analysis showed that saliva of normal bugs prolonged plasma coagulation by about four-fold when compared to saliva of knockdown bugs. These results and the light color of the salivary gland content from some insects are consistent with the knockdown findings. The findings suggest that RNAi will prove a highly valuable functional genomics technique in triatomine bugs. The finding that feeding dsRNA can induce knockdown is novel for insects.

Primates worldwide consequently have been affected by the loss of their natural ecosystems. Long-tailed macaques ( Macaca fascilularis ) in Southern Thailand have, however, learned to exploit oil palm nuts using stone tools. Using camera traps, we captured the stone tool behavior of one macaque group in Ao Phang-Nga National Park. Line transects placed throughout an abandoned oil palm plantation confirmed a high abundance of nut cracking sites. Long-tailed macaques previously have been observed using stone tools to harvest shellfish along the coasts of Thailand and Myanmar. The novel nut processing behavior indicates the successful transfer of existing lithic technology to a new food source. Such behavioral plasticity has been suggested to underlie cultural behavior in animals, suggesting that long-tailed macaques have potential to exhibit cultural tendencies.

Their uncertain history raises management questions regarding origins, genetic diversity, and long-term genetic viability. Hair samples with follicles were collected from 196 horses in the Park and used to sequence the control region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and to profile 12 autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) markers. Three mtDNA haplotypes found in the TRNP horses belonged to haplogroups L and B. The control region variation was low with haplotype diversity of 0.5271, nucleotide diversity of 0.0077 and mean pairwise difference of 2.93. We sequenced one mitochondrial genome from each haplotype determined by the control region. Two complete mtDNA sequences of haplogroup L were closely related to the mtDNA of American Paint horse. The TRNP haplotype B did not have close matches in GenBank. The phylogenetic test placed this sequence in a group consisting of two horses from China, one from Yakutia, and one from Italy raising a possibility of historical transportation of horses from Siberia and East Asia to North America. Autosomal STR loci were polymorphic and indicated that the TRNP horses were distinctly different from 48 major horse breeds. Heterozygosity, mean number of alleles, and other measures of diversity indicated that TRNP herd diversity was below that observed for most other feral herds and domestic breeds. Both mtDNA and STRs demonstrated that the existing genetic data sets of horses are insufficient to determine the exact origins of the TRNP horses. However, measures of nuclear and mitochondrial diversity have elucidated management needs. It is recommended that new genetic stock be introduced and that adaptive management principles are employed to ensure that unique mitochondrial lineages are preserved and genetic diversity is increased and maintained over time.",PloS one,ANIMAL

This may explain in part why the recent movement away from the use of gastric lavage in the West has not been followed in the developing world. After noting probable harm from gastric lavage in Sri Lanka, we performed an observational study to determine how lavage is routinely performed and the frequency of complications.    Case series:  Fourteen consecutive gastric lavages were observed in four hospitals. Lavage was given to patients unable or unwilling to undergo forced emesis, regardless of whether they gave consent or the time elapsed since ingestion. It was also given to patients who had taken non-lethal ingestions. The airway was rarely protected in patients with reduced consciousness, large volumes of fluid were given for each cycle (200 to more than 1000 ml), and monitoring was not used. Serious complications likely to be due to the lavage were observed including cardiac arrest and probable aspiration of fluid. Health care workers perceived lavage as being highly effective and often life-saving; there was peer and relative pressure to perform lavage in self-poisoned patients.    Conclusions:  Gastric lavage as performed for highly toxic poisons in a resource-poor location is hazardous. In the absence of evidence for patient benefit from lavage, (and in agreement with some local guidelines), we believe that lavage should be considered for few patients ‚Äì in those who have recently taken a potentially fatal dose of a poison, and who either give their verbal consent for the procedure or are sedated and intubated.

0.731287968,24971020,Progression-free survival as a potential surrogate for overall survival in metastatic breast cancer,"Background Progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP) are frequently used to establish the clinical efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. However, the surrogacy of PFS/TTP for overall survival (OS) remains a matter of uncertainty in metastatic breast cancer (mBC). This study assessed the relationship between PFS/TTP and OS in mBC using a trial-based approach. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review according to the PICO method: ‚ÄòPopulation‚Äô consisted of women with mBC; ‚ÄòInterventions‚Äô and ‚ÄòComparators‚Äô were standard treatments for mBC or best supportive care; ‚ÄòOutcomes‚Äô of interest were median PFS/TTP and OS. We first performed a correlation analysis between median PFS/TTP and OS, and then conducted subgroup analyses to explore possible reasons for heterogeneity. Then, we assessed the relationship between the treatment effect on PFS/TTP and OS. The treatment effect on PFS/TTP and OS was quantified by the absolute difference of median values. We also conducted linear regression analysis to predict the effects of a new anti-cancer drug on OS on the basis of its effects on PFS/TTP. Results A total of 5,041 studies were identified, and 144 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. There was a statistically significant relationship between median PFS/TTP and OS across included trials (r=0.428; P <0.01). Correlation coefficient for the treatment effect on PFS/TTP and OS was estimated at 0.427 ( P <0.01). The obtained linear regression equation was ŒîOS =‚àí0.088 (95% confidence interval [CI] ‚àí1.347‚Äì1.172) + 1.753 (95% CI 1.307‚Äì2.198) √ó ŒîPFS (R 2 =0.86). Conclusion Results of this study indicate a significant association between PFS/TTP and OS in mBC, which may justify the use of PFS/TTP in the approval for commercialization and reimbursement of new anti-cancer drugs in this cancer setting.",OncoTargets and therapy,ONCO

Viruses were obtained during 2010‚Äì2012 from influenza surveillance cohorts in Cusco, Tumbes, Puerto Maldonado, and Lima. Specimens positive for influenza A(H3N2) virus were randomly selected and underwent hemagglutinin sequencing and phylogeographic analyses. Analysis of 389 hemagglutinin sequences from Peru and 2,192 global sequences demonstrated interseasonal extinction of Peruvian lineages. Extensive mixing occurred with global clades, but some spatial structure was observed at all sites; this structure was weakest in Lima and Puerto Maldonado, indicating that these locations may experience greater viral traffic. The broad diversity and co-circulation of many simultaneous lineages of H3N2 virus in Peru suggests that this country should not be overlooked as a potential source for novel pandemic strains.",Emerging infectious diseases,IMMUN
0.636633458,28536277,3D mathematical modeling of glioblastoma suggests that transdifferentiated vascular endothelial cells mediate resistance to current standard-of-care therapy," Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive brain tumor in human patients, is decidedly heterogeneous and highly vascularized. Glioma stem/initiating cells (GSC) are found to play a crucial role by increasing cancer aggressiveness and promoting resistance to therapy. Recently, crosstalk between GSC and vascular endothelial cells has been shown to significantly promote GSC self-renewal and tumor progression. Further, GSC also transdifferentiate into bona-fide vascular endothelial cells (GEC), which inherit mutations present in GSC and are resistant to traditional anti-angiogenic therapies. Here we use 3D mathematical modeling to investigate GBM progression and response to therapy. The model predicted that GSC drive invasive fingering and that GEC spontaneously form a network within the hypoxic core, consistent with published experimental findings. Standard-of-care treatments using DNA-targeted therapy (radiation/chemo) together with anti-angiogenic therapies, reduced GBM tumor size but increased invasiveness. Anti-GEC treatments blocked the GEC support of GSC and reduced tumor size but led to increased invasiveness. Anti-GSC therapies that promote differentiation or disturb the stem cell niche effectively reduced tumor invasiveness and size, but were ultimately limited in reducing tumor size because GEC maintain GSC. Our study suggests that a combinatorial regimen targeting the vasculature, GSC, and GEC, using drugs already approved by the FDA, can reduce both tumor size and invasiveness and could lead to tumor eradication.

0.567392675,22368268,HD2C interacts with HDA6 and is involved in ABA and salt stress response in  Arabidopsis,"HD2 proteins are plant specific histone deacetylases. Four HD2 proteins, HD2A, HD2B, HD2C, and HD2D, have been identified in Arabidopsis . It was found that the expression of HD2A , HD2B , HD2C , and HD2D was repressed by ABA and NaCl. To investigate the function of HD2 proteins further, two HD2C T-DNA insertion lines of Arabidopsis , hd2c-1 and hd2c-3 were identified. Compared with wild-type plants, hd2c-1 and hd2c-3 plants displayed increased sensitivity to ABA and NaCl during germination and decreased tolerance to salt stress. These observations support a role of HD2C in the ABA and salt-stress response in Arabidopsis . Moreover, it was demonstrated that HD2C interacted physically with a RPD3-type histone deacetylase, HDA6, and bound to histone H3. The expression of ABA-responsive genes, ABI1 and ABI2 , was increased in hda6 , hd2c , and hda6 / hd2c-1 double mutant plants, which was associated with increased histone H3K9K14 acetylation and decreased histone H3K9 dimethylation.

0.523882106,21445058,Retromer terminates the generation of cAMP by internalized PTH-receptors," Generation of cAMP by G protein‚Äìcoupled receptors (GPCRs) and its termination is currently thought to occur exclusively at the plasma membrane of cells. Under existing models of receptor regulation, this signal is primarily restricted by desensitizationof the receptors through their binding to Œ≤-arrestins. However, this paradigm is not consistent with recent observations that the parathyroid hormone receptor type 1 (PTHR) continues to stimulate cAMP production even after receptor internalization, as Œ≤-arrestins are known to rapidly bind and internalize activated PTHR. Here we show that Œ≤-arrestin1 binding prolongs rather than terminates cAMP generation by PTHR, and that cAMP generation correlates with the persistence of arrestin-receptor complexes on endosomes. We found that PTHR signaling is instead turned-off by the retromer complex, which regulates traffic of internalized receptor from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus. Thus, binding by the retromer complex regulates sustained cAMP generation triggered by an internalized GPCR. ",Nature chemical biology,BIOCHEM

Validation of the force field and simulation methodology is done by comparing calculated transglycosidic J -coupling constants and proton-proton distances with the corresponding NMR data. Initial calculations showed poor agreement, for example, with > 3 Hz deviation of the calculated 3 J (H5,H6 R ) values from the experimental data, prompting optimization of the œâ torsion angle parameters associated with (1‚Üí6)-linkages. The resulting force field is in overall good agreement (i.e. within ~ 0.5 Hz deviation) from experimental 3 J (H5,H6 R ) values, although some small limitations are evident. Detailed hydrogen bonding analysis indicates that most of the compounds lack direct intramolecular H-bonds between the two monosaccharides; however, minor sampling of the O6¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑HO2‚Ä≤ hydrogen bond is present in three compounds. The results verify the role of the gauche effect between O5 and O6 atoms in gluco - and manno -configured pyranosides causing the œâ torsion angle to sample an equilibrium between the gt and gg rotamers. Conversely, galacto -configured pyranosides sample a population distribution in equilibrium between gt and tg rotamers, while the gg rotamer populations are minor. Water radial distribution functions suggest decreased accessibility to the O6 atom in the (1‚Üí6)-linkage as compared to the O6' atom in the non-reducing sugar. The role of bridging water molecules between two sugar moieties on the distributions of œâ torsion angles in oligosaccharides is also explored. ",The journal of physical chemistry. B,CHEM
0.928290111,29321894,Development of a genotype‚Äêby‚Äêsequencing immunogenetic assay as exemplified by screening for variation in red fox with and without endemic rabies exposure,"Abstract Pathogens are recognized as major drivers of local adaptation in wildlife systems. By determining which gene variants are favored in local interactions among populations with and without disease, spatially explicit adaptive responses to pathogens can be elucidated. Much of our current understanding of host responses to disease comes from a small number of genes associated with an immune response. High‚Äêthroughput sequencing ( HTS ) technologies, such as genotype‚Äêby‚Äêsequencing ( GBS ), facilitate expanded explorations of genomic variation among populations. Hybridization‚Äêbased GBS techniques can be leveraged in systems not well characterized for specific variants associated with disease outcome to ‚Äúcapture‚Äù specific genes and regulatory regions known to influence expression and disease outcome. We developed a multiplexed, sequence capture assay for red foxes to simultaneously assess ~300‚Äêkbp of genomic sequence from 116 adaptive, intrinsic, and innate immunity genes of predicted adaptive significance and their putative upstream regulatory regions along with 23 neutral microsatellite regions to control for demographic effects. The assay was applied to 45 fox DNA samples from Alaska, where three arctic rabies strains are geographically restricted and endemic to coastal tundra regions, yet absent from the boreal interior. The assay provided 61.5% on‚Äêtarget enrichment with relatively even sequence coverage across all targeted loci and samples (mean¬†=¬†50√ó), which allowed us to elucidate genetic variation across introns, exons, and potential regulatory regions (4,819 SNP s). Challenges remained in accurately describing microsatellite variation using this technique; however, longer‚Äêread HTS technologies should overcome these issues. We used these data to conduct preliminary analyses and detected genetic structure in a subset of red fox immune‚Äêrelated genes between regions with and without endemic arctic rabies.

[ 1 ] The primary requirements for this type of molecules are the ability to form non-covalent complexes with individual DNA bases and to generate recognizable electronic signatures under an electrical bias. 1- H -imidazole-2-carboxamide was designed as such a recognition moiety to interact with the DNA bases through hydrogen bonding. In the present study, we first furnished a synthetic route to 1- H -imidazole-2-carboxamide containing a short œâ-functionalized alkyl chain at its 4(5) position for its attachment to metal and carbon electrodes. The acid dissociation constants of the imidazole-2-carboxamide were then determined by UV spectroscopy. The data show that the 1- H -imidazole-2-carboxamide exists in a neutral form between pH 6‚Äì10. Density functional theory (DFT) and NMR studies indicate that the imidazole ring exists in prototropic tautomers. We propose an intramolecular mechanism for tautomerization of 1- H -imidazole-2-carboxamide. In addition, the imidazole-2-carboxamide can self-associate to form hydrogen bonded dimers. NMR titration found that naturally occurring nucleosides interacted with 1- H -imidazole-2-carboxamide through hydrogen bonding in a tendency of dG>dC‚â´dT> dA.

0.684790495,19045539,A New Method for Measuring Deformation of Folding Surfaces during Morphogenesis," During morphogenesis, epithelia (cell sheets) undergo complex deformations as they stretch, bend, and twist to form the embryo. Often these changes in shape create multi-valued surfaces that can be problematic for strain measurements. This paper presents a method for quantifying deformation of such surfaces. The method requires four-dimensional spatiotemporal coordinates of a finite number of surface markers, acquired using standard imaging techniques. From the coordinates of the markers, various deformation measures are computed as functions of time and space using straightforward matrix algebra. This method accommodates sparse, randomly scattered marker arrays, with reasonable errors in marker locations. The accuracy of the method is examined for some sample problems with exact solutions. Then, the utility of the method is illustrated by using it to measure surface stretch ratios and shear in the looping heart and developing brain of the early chick embryo. In these examples, microspheres are tracked using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This technique provides a new tool that can be used in studies of the mechanics of morphogenesis.

We aim to evaluate the outcomes, prognostic factors and failure patterns of CEC treated by contemporary radiotherapy (RT). Methods We retrospectively analyzed 86 CEC patients consecutively treated between 2007 and 2015 by definitive RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy. RT was mainly delivered with Intensity Modulated Irradiation Therapy (IMRT) or Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT). Statistical analyses were performed on survival, prognostic factors and failure patterns. Results The median follow-up time was 19.4 months. The 3-year overall survival (OS), local regional failure free survival (LRFFS), distant metastatic free survival (DMFS), and progression free survival (PFS) were 53.6%, 57.9%, 81.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Independent predictors for poorer OS were N stage, hoarseness and recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph node (RLN) involvement, and predictors for LRFFS were N stage and EQD2 (equivalent dose in 2 Gy fraction) to gross tumor volume (GTV), with ‚â• 66Gy achieving local control of 94.7%. Patients receiving elective nodal irradiation (ENI) had better nodal regional control than those receiving involved field irradiation (IFI). 31 (36%) patients had treatment failure and 15 (17.4%), 8 (9.3%) and 14 (16.2%) patients had local, regional, and distant failure, respectively. 86.7% (13/15) local failures were within GTV, and supraclavicular region (62.5%, 5/8) was the most common regional failure site.

We validate that the primary colorectal tumors exhibit heterogeneous telomere lengths but mostly (90%) short telomeres relative to normal tissues. Intriguingly, relatively short telomeres are associated with tumor malignancy as indicated by poorly differentiated state, and these tumors contain more cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) identified by several commonly used markers CD44, EPHB2 or LGR5. Moreover, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and ALT-associated PML nuclear bodies (APBs) are frequently found in tumors with short telomeres and high proliferation. In contrast, distant normal tissues rarely or only minimally express PML.

Speculations on maritime adaptations and typological links (stemmed points) across thousands of kilometers have also been advanced. A review of the current genetic, archeological, and paleoecological evidence indicates that ancestral Native American population expansion occurred after 16,000 years ago, consistent with the archeological record, particularly with the earliest securely dated sites after ~15,000 years ago. These data are largely consistent with either an inland (ice-free corridor) or Pacific coastal routes (or both), but neither can be rejected at present.

0.504178555,26719249,Defining the Microglia Response during the Time Course of Chronic Neurodegeneration,"ABSTRACT Inflammation has been proposed as a major component of neurodegenerative diseases, although the precise role it plays has yet to be defined. We examined the role of key contributors to this inflammatory process, microglia, the major resident immune cell population of the brain, in a prion disease model of chronic neurodegeneration. Initially, we performed an extensive reanalysis of a large study of prion disease, where the transcriptome of mouse brains had been monitored throughout the time course of disease. Our analysis has provided a detailed classification of the disease-associated genes based on cell type of origin and gene function. This revealed that the genes upregulated during disease, regardless of the strain of mouse or prion protein, are expressed predominantly by activated microglia. In order to study the microglia contribution more specifically, we established a mouse model of prion disease in which the 79A murine prion strain was introduced by an intraperitoneal route into BALB/cJ Fms-EGFP/ ‚àí mice, which express enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of the c-fms operon. Samples were taken at time points during disease progression, and histological analysis of the brain and transcriptional analysis of isolated microglia was carried out. The analysis of isolated microglia revealed a disease-specific, highly proinflammatory signature in addition to an upregulation of genes associated with metabolism and respiratory stress. This study strongly supports the growing recognition of the importance of microglia within the prion disease process and identifies the nature of the response through gene expression analysis of isolated microglia. IMPORTANCE Inflammation has been proposed as a major component of neurodegenerative diseases.

Using experimental data created by Hunter and Vogelaar, the formula precisely reproduces experimental results for the standardized Kla at 20 ¬∞C, comparatively better than the current model used by ASCE 2‚Äì06 based on the equation Kla 20 = Kla. ( Œ∏ ) (20‚àíT) where T is in ¬∞C. Currently, reported values for Œ∏ range from 1.008 to 1.047. Because it is a geometric function, large error can result if an incorrect value of Œ∏ is used. Establishment of such value for an aeration system can only be made by means of series of full scale testing over a range of temperatures required. The new model predicts oxygen transfer coefficients to within 1% error compared to observed measurements. This is a breakthrough since the correct prediction of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (Kla) is a crucial step in the design, operation and scale up of bioreactors including wastewater treatment plant aeration tanks, and the equation developed allows doing so without resorting to multiple full scale testing for each individual tank under the same testing condition for different temperatures. The effect of temperature on the transfer rate coefficient Kla is explored in this paper, and it is recommended to replace the current model by this new model given by: K l a 20 = K l a ( E œÅ œÉ ) 20 ( E œÅ œÉ ) T ( T 20 T ) 5 where T is in degree Kelvin, and the subscripts refer to degree Celsius; E, œÅ, œÉ are properties of water.

0.425806363,21031033,"Reversible Inactivation of Rat Premotor Cortex Impairs Temporal Preparation, but not Inhibitory Control, During Simple Reaction-Time Performance","Previous studies by our lab and others have established a role for medial areas of the prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the top‚Äìdown control of action during simple reaction-time (RT) tasks. However, the neural circuits that allow mPFC to influence activity in the motor system have remained unclear. In the present study, we used a combination of tract-tracing and reversible inactivation methods to examine the role of a motor-related area in the rat frontal cortex, called the rostral forelimb area (RFA), in the top‚Äìdown control of action. Neural tracing studies involved used electrical microstimulation to identify RFA and injections of biotinylated dextran amines (BDA) to map out connections of RFA with other parts of the frontal cortex. Connections were found between RFA and mPFC, the agranular insular cortex, and the primary motor cortex. Reversible inactivations using muscimol infusions into RFA increased response times and eliminated delay-dependent speeding, but did not increase premature responding. These results are markedly different from what is obtained when muscimol is infused into mPFC, which leads to excessive premature responding and a reduction of RTs to stimuli at short delays (Narayanan et al., 2006 ). We also tested animals during the RT task after inactivating the agranular insular cortex, which contains neurons that projects to and receives from RFA and mPFC, and found no effects on RT performance. Together, these studies suggest that RFA is a premotor region in the rat frontal cortex that competes with mPFC to control action selection. We suggest that RFA controls the threshold that is used to initiate responding and generates prepotent excitation over responding that is crucial for temporal preparation.",Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,NEURO
0.267864936,31507438,Effects of Prolonged Head-Down Bed Rest on Cardiac and Vascular Baroreceptor Modulation and Orthostatic Tolerance in Healthy Individuals,"Orthostatic intolerance commonly occurs after prolonged bed rest, thus increasing the risk of syncope and falls. Baroreflex-mediated adjustments of heart rate and sympathetic vasomotor activity (muscle sympathetic nerve activity ‚Äì MSNA) are crucial for orthostatic tolerance. We hypothesized that prolonged bed rest deconditioning alters overall baroreceptor functioning, thereby reducing orthostatic tolerance in healthy volunteers. As part of the European Space Agency Medium-term Bed Rest protocol, 10 volunteers were studied before and after 21 days of ‚àí6¬∞ head down bed rest (HDBR). In both conditions, subjects underwent ECG, beat-by-beat blood pressure, respiratory activity, and MSNA recordings while supine (REST) and during a 15-min 80¬∞ head-up tilt (TILT) followed by a 3-min ‚àí10 mmHg stepwise increase of lower body negative pressure to pre-syncope. Cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (cBRS) was obtained in the time (sequence method) and frequency domain (spectrum and cross-spectrum analyses of RR interval and systolic arterial pressure ‚Äì SAP, variability). Baroreceptor modulation of sympathetic discharge activity to the vessels (sBRS) was estimated by the slope of the regression line between the percentage of MSNA burst occurrence and diastolic arterial pressure. Orthostatic tolerance significantly decreased after HDBR (12 ¬± 0.6 min) compared to before (21 ¬± 0.6 min). While supine, heart rate, SAP, and cBRS were unchanged before and after HDBR, sBRS gain was slightly depressed after than before HDBR (sBRS: ‚àí6.0 ¬± 1.1 versus ‚àí2.9 ¬± 1.5 burst% √ó mmHg ‚àí1 , respectively). During TILT, HR was higher after than before HDBR (116 ¬± 4 b/min versus 100 ¬± 4 b/min, respectively), SAP was unmodified in both conditions, and cBRS indexes were lower after HDBR ( Œ± index: 3.4 ¬± 0.7 ms/mmHg; BRS SEQ 4.0 ¬± 1.0) than before ( Œ± index: 6.4 ¬± 1.0 ms/mmHg; BRS SEQ 6.8 ¬± 1.2). sBRS gain was significantly more depressed after HDBR than before (sBRS: ‚àí2.3 ¬± 0.7 versus ‚àí4.4 ¬± 0.4 burst% √ó mmHg ‚àí1 , respectively).

This study focuses on frontotemporal spikes, which are typically characterized by a preceding anterior temporal peak followed by an ipsilateral inferior frontal peak. Ten patients with frontotemporal spikes on MEG/EEG were studied. We analyzed the propagation of temporal to frontal epileptic spikes on both MEG and EEG independently by using a cortically-constrained minimum norm estimate (MNE). Spatiotemporal source distribution of each spike was obtained on the cortical surface derived from the patient‚Äôs MRI. All patients underwent an extraoperative intracranial EEG (IEEG) recording covering temporal and frontal lobes after presurgical evaluation. We extracted source waveforms of MEG and EEG from the source distribution of interictal spikes at the sites corresponding to the location of intracranial electrodes. The time differences of the ipsilateral temporal and frontal peaks as obtained by MEG, EEG and IEEG were statistically compared in each patient. In all patients, MEG and IEEG showed similar time differences between temporal and frontal peaks. The time differences of EEG spikes were significantly smaller than those of IEEG in nine of ten patients. Spatiotemporal analysis of MEG spikes models the time course of frontotemporal spikes as observed on IEEG more adequately than EEG in our patients. Spatiotemporal source analysis may be useful for planning epilepsy surgery, by predicting the pattern of IEEG spikes. ",NeuroImage,NEURO

0.723728414,26159706,Proteomic analysis of purified turkey adenovirus 3 virions,"Turkey adenovirus 3 (TAdV-3) causes high mortality and significant economic losses to the turkey industry. However, little is known about the molecular determinants required for viral replication and pathogenesis . Moreover, TAdV-3 does not grow well in cell culture, thus detailed structural studies of the infectious particle is particularly challenging. To develop a better understanding of virus-host interactions, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of proteinase K treated purified TAdV-3 virions isolated from spleens of infected turkeys, by utilizing one-dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 13 viral proteins associated with TAdV-3 virions including a novel uncharacterized TaV3gp04 protein. Further, we detected 18 host proteins in purified virions, many of which are involved in cell-to cell spread, cytoskeleton dynamics and virus replication. Notably, seven of these host proteins have not yet been reported to be present in any other purified virus. In addition, five of these proteins are known antiviral host restriction factors. The availability of reagents allowed us to identify two cellular proteins (collagen alpha-1 (VI) chain and haemoglobin) in the purified TAdV-3 preparations. These results represent the first comprehensive proteomic profile of TAdV-3 and may provide information for illustrating TAdV-3 replication and pathogenesis.

Methods We evaluated the association between levels of control of atherosclerotic risk factors and time to mortality following either lower extremity bypass surgery or lower extremity amputation using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results Among 796 patients with PAD (defined by an ankle-brachial index [ABI] < 0.9), 230 (28.9%) underwent an operation for PAD (136, lower-extremity bypasses; 111, lower-extremity amputations). Participants were followed for up to six years after their diagnosis of PAD. A total of 107 (46.5% of the 230) died during the period of follow-up. Factors associated with mortality following lower extremity bypass surgery included age 70 years and older hazard ratio [HR] 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01‚Äì3.51) and of African American race (HR 1.94; 95% CI: 1.04‚Äì3.62). Renal insufficiency was significantly associated with mortality following lower extremity amputation (HR 2.19; 95% CI: 1.16‚Äì4.13).

0.894809738,18433478,Identification of coherent patterns in gene expression data using an efficient biclustering algorithm and parallel coordinate visualization,"Background The DNA microarray technology allows the measurement of expression levels of thousands of genes under tens/hundreds of different conditions. In microarray data, genes with similar functions usually co-express under certain conditions only [ 1 ]. Thus, biclustering which clusters genes and conditions simultaneously is preferred over the traditional clustering technique in discovering these coherent genes. Various biclustering algorithms have been developed using different bicluster formulations. Unfortunately, many useful formulations result in NP-complete problems. In this article, we investigate an efficient method for identifying a popular type of biclusters called additive model. Furthermore, parallel coordinate (PC) plots are used for bicluster visualization and analysis. Results We develop a novel and efficient biclustering algorithm which can be regarded as a greedy version of an existing algorithm known as pCluster algorithm. By relaxing the constraint in homogeneity, the proposed algorithm has polynomial-time complexity in the worst case instead of exponential-time complexity as in the pCluster algorithm. Experiments on artificial datasets verify that our algorithm can identify both additive-related and multiplicative-related biclusters in the presence of overlap and noise. Biologically significant biclusters have been validated on the yeast cell-cycle expression dataset using Gene Ontology annotations. Comparative study shows that the proposed approach outperforms several existing biclustering algorithms. We also provide an interactive exploratory tool based on PC plot visualization for determining the parameters of our biclustering algorithm. Conclusion We have proposed a novel biclustering algorithm which works with PC plots for an interactive exploratory analysis of gene expression data. Experiments show that the biclustering algorithm is efficient and is capable of detecting co-regulated genes. The interactive analysis enables an optimum parameter determination in the biclustering algorithm so as to achieve the best result. In future, we will modify the proposed algorithm for other bicluster models such as the coherent evolution model.",BMC bioinformatics,CS
0.736634614,21331174,"Hippocampal Subfield Volumes: Age, Vascular Risk, and Correlation with Associative Memory","Aging and age-related diseases have negative impact on the hippocampus (HC), which is crucial for such age-sensitive functions as memory formation, maintenance, and retrieval. We examined age differences in hippocampal subfield volumes in 10 younger and 19 older adults, and association of those volumes with memory performance in the older participants. We manually measured volumes of HC regions CA1 and CA2 (CA1‚Äì2), sectors CA3 and CA4 plus dentate gyrus (CA3‚Äì4/DG), subiculum, and the entorhinal cortex using a contrast-optimized high-resolution PD-weighted MRI sequence. Although, as in previous reports, the volume of one region (CA1‚Äì2) was larger in the young, the difference was due to the presence of hypertensive subjects among the older adults. Among older participants, increased false alarm rate in an associative recognition memory task was linked to reduced CA3‚Äì4/DG volume.

0.77207582,19903736,Anterior temporal lobe connectivity correlates with functional outcome after aphasic stroke,"Focal brain lesions are assumed to produce language deficits by two basic mechanisms: local cortical dysfunction at the lesion site, and remote cortical dysfunction due to disruption of the transfer and integration of information between connected brain regions. However, functional imaging studies investigating language outcome after aphasic stroke have tended to focus only on the role of local cortical function. In this positron emission tomography functional imaging study, we explored relationships between language comprehension performance after aphasic stroke and the functional connectivity of a key speech-processing region in left anterolateral superior temporal cortex. We compared the organization of left anterolateral superior temporal cortex functional connections during narrative speech comprehension in normal subjects with left anterolateral superior temporal cortex connectivity in a group of chronic aphasic stroke patients. We then evaluated the language deficits associated with altered left anterolateral superior temporal cortex connectivity in aphasic stroke. During normal narrative speech comprehension, left anterolateral superior temporal cortex displayed positive functional connections with left anterior basal temporal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and homotopic cortex in right anterolateral superior temporal cortex. As a group, aphasic patients demonstrated a selective disruption of the normal functional connection between left and right anterolateral superior temporal cortices. We observed that deficits in auditory single word and sentence comprehension correlated both with the degree of disruption of left-right anterolateral superior temporal cortical connectivity and with local activation in the anterolateral superior temporal cortex. Subgroup analysis revealed that aphasic patients with preserved positive intertemporal connectivity displayed better receptive language function; these patients also showed greater than normal left inferior frontal gyrus activity, suggesting a possible ‚Äòtop-down‚Äô compensatory mechanism. These results demonstrate that functional connectivity between anterolateral superior temporal cortex and right anterior superior temporal cortex is a marker of receptive language outcome after aphasic stroke, and illustrate that language system organization after focal brain lesions may be marked by complex signatures of altered local and pathway-level function.",Brain : a journal of neurology,NEURO
0.645805199,30793089,Dynamic properties of simulated brain network models and empirical resting-state data,"Brain network models (BNMs) have become a promising theoretical framework for simulating signals that are representative of whole-brain activity such as resting-state fMRI. However, it has been difficult to compare the complex brain activity obtained from simulations to empirical data. Previous studies have used simple metrics to characterize coordination between regions such as functional connectivity. We extend this by applying various different dynamic analysis tools that are currently used to understand empirical resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to the simulated data. We show that certain properties correspond to the structural connectivity input that is shared between the models, and certain dynamic properties relate more to the mathematical description of the brain network model. We conclude that the dynamic properties that explicitly examine patterns of signal as a function of time rather than spatial coordination between different brain regions in the rs-fMRI signal seem to provide the largest contrasts between different BNMs and the unknown empirical dynamical system. Our results will be useful in constraining and developing more realistic simulations of whole-brain activity. Author Summary The development of more sophisticated models of the brain will allow us to address some of the most challenging questions in neuroscience, such as how the physical structure of the brain can give rise to behavior, consciousness, and memory. Our focus in this manuscript is on simulating the relatively slow brain signals that coordinate information transfer across large scales in the brain and that can be measured using fMRI. Previous measures used averaged measures of functional connectivity in the simulated brain signals to compare with the empirical signal. In order to extend previous findings, we use dynamic analysis techniques developed for these fMRI signals to understand more transient events that occur naturally during normal brain activity. We show that these dynamic properties are better in differentiating models from each other and from the measured brain activity. These results will be useful in constraining and developing more realistic simulations of whole-brain activity.","Network neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.)",NEURO
0.290233206,19552933,HPV16 E7 oncogene expression in normal human epithelial cells causes molecular changes indicative of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition," Cancer-associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for invasion and metastasis. Molecular hallmarks of EMT include down-regulation of the epithelial adhesion protein E-cadherin, de-novo expression of N-cadherin and the mesenchymal intermediate filament proteins vimentin and fibronectin. Expression of HPV16 E7 in normal human epithelial cells caused increased levels of vimentin and fibronectin, whereas the epithelial adhesion protein E-cadherin was expressed at decreased levels. Similar patterns of vimentin, fibronectin and E-cadherin expression were also detected in cells expressing HPV16 E6 and E7 or the entire HPV16 early transcriptional unit. HPV16 E6 and E7 were each able to induce N-cadherin expression. Interestingly, these changes in expression levels of EMT associated proteins are not similarly reflected at the level of mRNA expression, suggesting that HPV16 oncoproteins may also modulate EMT through non-transcriptional mechanisms. Hence, HPV16 oncoproteins may contribute to malignant progression through EMT induction. ",Virology,IMMUN
0.004923829,28534797,Transition Icons for Time Series Visualization and Exploratory Analysis," The modern healthcare landscape has seen the rapid emergence of techniques and devices which temporally monitor and record physiological signals. The prevalence of time series data within the healthcare field necessitates the development of methods which can analyze the data in order to draw meaningful conclusions. Time series behavior is notoriously difficult to intuitively understand due to its intrinsic high-dimensionality, which is compounded in the case of analyzing groups of time series collected from different patients. Our framework, which we call Transition Icons, renders common patterns in a visual format useful for understanding the shared behavior within groups of time series. Transition Icons are adept at detecting and displaying subtle differences and similarities e.g. between measurements taken from patients receiving different treatment strategies or stratified by demographics. We introduce various methods which collectively allow for exploratory analysis of groups of time series, while being free of distribution assumptions and including simple heuristics for parameter determination.  Our technique extracts discrete transition patterns from Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) representations, and compiles transition frequencies into a Bag of Patterns (BoP) constructed for each group. These transition frequencies are normalized and aligned in icon form to intuitively display the underlying patterns.  We demonstrate the Transition Icon technique for two time series data sets ‚Äì postoperative pain scores, and hip-worn accelerometer activity counts. We believe Transition Icons can be an important tool for researchers approaching time series data, as they give rich and intuitive information about collective time series behaviors.

0.123225207,19684606,Toll-like receptor 2 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 promote central nervous system neuroinflammation in progressive EAE," Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that begins as a relapsing-remitting disease (RRMS) and is followed by a progressive phase (SPMS). The progressive phase causes the greatest disability and has no effective therapy, but the processes that drive SPMS are mostly unknown. Here we found higher serum concentrations of 15Œ±-hydroxicholestene (15-HC) in patients with SPMS and in mice with secondary progressive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) but not in patients with RRMS. In mice, 15-HC activated microglia, macrophages and astrocytes through a pathway involving Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1). PARP-1 activity was higher in monocytes of patients with SPMS, and PARP-1 inhibition suppressed the progression of EAE. Thus, the TLR2‚ÄìPARP-1 pathway is a potential new therapeutic target in SPMS.

0.464529702,23788935,Management of breakthrough pain due to cancer,"Breakthrough pain is defined as the transient exacerbation of pain occurring in a patient with otherwise stable, persistent pain. It is estimated to affect over 50% of patients, particularly those with moderate to severe background pain. Breakthrough pain is one of the most difficult pain syndromes to treat. There are several types of breakthrough cancer pain: incidental type involves flares of pain associated with movement or activity; idiopathic type is transitory pain unrelated to a specific activity; and in end-of-dose failure pain occurs when blood levels of medications fall below an analgesic threshold at the end of a dosing interval. Persistent and breakthrough pain are distinct components of cancer pain and require separate management. Successful management of breakthrough pain may require a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies. Supplemental analgesia, known as rescue medication, is a common pharmacological treatment option. Breakthrough pain is treated with supplemental short-acting opioid use, as needed, e.g. short-acting morphine, intranasal fentanyl and buccal tablets of fentanyl.","Contemporary oncology (Poznan, Poland)",ONCO
0.279051271,29870821,Free viewing of sad and happy faces in depression: A potential target for attention bias modification,"  Background:  Identification of reliable targets for therapeutic interventions is essential for developing evidence-based therapies. Attention biases toward negative-valenced information and lack of protective positive bias toward positive-valenced stimuli have been implicated in depression. However, extant research has typically used tasks with narrow stimuli arrays and unknown or poor psychometric properties. Here, we recorded eye-tracking data of depressed and non-depressed participants during a free viewing task to address these limitations.    Methods:  Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 20) and undergraduate students with high ( n = 23) and low ( n = 20) levels of depression freely viewed 60 different face-based matrices for six seconds each. Each matrix included eight sad and eight happy facial expressions. Gaze patterns on sad and happy areas of interest (AOIs) were explored. Internal consistency for the entire sample and one-week test-retest reliability in the student sub-sample were assessed.    Results:  Compared to undergraduates with low levels of depression, patients with MDD and students with high levels of depression dwelled significantly longer on sad faces. Results also showed a significantly longer dwell time on the happy AOI relative to the sad AOI only in the low depression group. The two depressed groups dwelled equally on the two AOIs. The task demonstrated high internal consistency and acceptable one-week test-retest reliability.    Limitations:  Only sad and happy facial expressions were used. Relative small sample size.    Conclusion:  Relative to non-depressed participants, depressed participants showed prolonged dwelling on sad faces and lack of bias toward happy faces. These biases present viable targets for gaze-contingent attention bias modification therapy.  ",Journal of affective disorders,PSYCH
0.367960355,27770702,Modulation of HCV replication and translation by ErbB3 binding protein1 isoforms," We recently identified a cell-factor, ErbB3 binding protein 1 (Ebp-1), which specifically interacts with the viral RNA genome and modulates HCV replication and translation. Ebp1 has two isoforms, p48, and p42, that result from differential splicing. We found that both isoforms interact with HCV proteins NS5A and NS5B, as well as cell-factor PKR. The p48 isoform, which localizes in the cytoplasm and nuclei, promoted HCV replication, whereas the shorter p42 isoform, which resides exclusively in the cytoplasm, strongly inhibited HCV replication. Transient expression of individual isoforms in Ebp1-knockdown MH14 cells confirmed that the p48 isoform promotes HCV replication, while the p42 isoform inhibits it. We found that Ebp1-p42 significantly enhanced autophosphorylation of PKR, while Ebp1-p48 isoform strongly inhibited it. We propose that modulation of autophosphorylation of PKR by p48 isoform is an important mechanism whereby the HCV virus escapes innate antiviral immune responses by circumventing p42-mediated inhibition of its replication.

0.197004584,16189711,Geography is a better determinant of human genetic differentiation than ethnicity," Individuals differ genetically in their susceptibility to particular diseases and their response to drugs. However, personalized treatments are difficult to develop, because disease susceptibility and drug response generally have poorly characterized genetic architecture. It is thus tempting to use the ethnicity of patients to capture some of the variation in allele frequencies at the genes underlying a clinical trait. The success of such a strategy depends on whether human populations can be accurately classified into discrete genetic ethnic groups. Despite the heated discussions and controversies surrounding this issue, there has been essentially no attempt so far to quantify the relative power of ethnic groups and geography at predicting the proportion of shared alleles between human populations. Here, we present the first such quantification using a dataset of 51 populations typed at 377 microsatellite markers, and show that pair-wise geographic distances across landmasses constitute a far better predictor than ethnicity. Allele sharing between human populations decays smoothly with increasing physical distance at a worldwide scale. We discuss the relevance of those patterns for the expected distribution of variants of medical interest. The distribution patterns for genes coding for simple traits are expected to be highly heterogeneous, as most such genes experienced strong natural selection. However variants involved in complex traits are expected to behave essentially neutrally and we expect them to fit closely our predictions based on microsatellites. We conclude that the use of ethnicity alone will often be inadequate as a basis for medical treatment. ",Human genetics,POPGENE

Pervasive healthcare systems apply information and communication technology to enable the usage of ubiquitous clinical data by authorized medical persons. However, quality of clinical data in these applications is, to a large extent, determined by the technological context of the patient. A technological context is characterized by potential technological disruptions that affect optimal functioning of technological resources. The clinical data based on input from these technological resources can therefore have quality degradations. If these degradations are not noticed, the use of this clinical data can lead to wrong treatment decisions, which potentially puts the patient‚Äôs safety at risk. This paper presents an ontology that specifies the relation among technological context, quality of clinical data, and patient treatment. The presented ontology provides a formal way to represent the knowledge to specify the effect of technological context variations in the clinical data quality and the impact of the clinical data quality on a patient‚Äôs treatment. Accordingly, this ontology is the foundation for a quality of data framework that enables the development of telemedicine systems that are capable of adapting the treatment when the quality of the clinical data degrades, and thus guaranteeing patients‚Äô safety even when technological context varies.

This study investigated the feasibility and reliability of using a commercial handheld dynamometer to measure the muscle strengths of the hip flexor, knee extensor, and dorsiflexor in the supine position with a modified method for patients at a stroke intensive care center within 7 days of stroke onset. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen persons with acute stroke participated in this cross-sectional study.

Tissue-engineered bone constructs have the potential to alleviate the demand arising from the shortage of suitable autograft and allograft materials for augmenting bone healing. Scaffolds play a central role in tissue engineering research, they not only provide as structural support for specific cells but also provide as the templates to guide new tissue growth and construction. In this survey we describe application of graphene based nano-biomaterials for bone tissue engineering. In this article, application of different graphene based materials on construction of manufacture scaffolds for bone tissue engineering was discussed. It begins by giving the reader a brief background on tissue engineering, followed by a comprehensive description of all the relevant components of graphene based materials, going from materials to scaffolds and from cells to tissue engineering strategies that will lead to ‚Äúengineered‚Äù bone. In this survey, more recent studies on the effects of graphene on surface modifications of scaffold materials was discused. The ability of graphene to improve the biological properties of scaffold materials, and its ability to promote the adhesion, proliferation, and osteoblasts have been demonstrated in several studies which we discuss in this survey article. We further highlight how the properties of graphene are being exploited for scaffolds in bone tissue engineering, comprehensively surveying recent experimental works featuring graphene and graphene derivatives. Bone tissue engineering, for the purpose of this survey, is the use of a scaffolding material to either induce formation of bone from the surrounding tissue or to act as a carrier or template for implanted bone cells or other agents.

The purpose of this study was to prove the hypothesis that verbal instructions combined with images showing the severe consequences of poor compliance can increase retainer use. Methods This study was a randomized controlled trial. The sample was recruited from Wenzhou, People‚Äôs Republic of China, between February 2013 and May 2014, and 326 participants were randomized into three groups. Patients and parents in Group A (n=106) were given routine retainer wear instructions only; in Group B (n=111), images illustrating the severe consequences of poor compliance with Hawley retainer use were shown to patients, combined with routine instructions; and in Group C (n=109), images illustrating the severe consequences of poor compliance with Hawley retainer use were shown to patients and parents, combined with routine instructions. Three months after debonding, questionnaires were used to investigate daily wear time and the reasons for poor compliance. Differences in means between the groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance. Results The mean daily wear time in Group C (15.09¬±4.13 hours) was significantly greater than in Group A (12.37¬±4.58 hours, P <0.01) or Group B (13.50¬±4.22 hours, P <0.05); the mean daily wear time in Group B was greater than in Group A, but was not significant ( P =0.67). Reasons for nonusage were forgetting to wear the retainer (51%) and finding the retainer bothersome to frequently insert and remove (42%).

Their disposal as radioactive waste would be costly. If the nature of steel contamination could be understood, effective decontamination strategies could be designed and implemented during nuclear site decommissioning in an effort to release the steels from regulatory control. Here, batch uptake experiments have been used to understand Sr and Cs (fission product radionuclides) uptake onto AISI Type 304 stainless steel under conditions representative of spent nuclear fuel storage (alkaline ponds) and PUREX nuclear fuel reprocessing (HNO 3 ). Solution (ICP-MS) and surface measurements (GD-OES depth profiling, TOF-SIMS, and XPS) and kinetic modeling of Sr and Cs removal from solution were used to characterize their uptake onto the steel and define the chemical composition and structure of the passive layer formed on the steel surfaces. Under passivating conditions (when the steel was exposed to solutions representative of alkaline ponds and 3 and 6 M HNO 3 ), Sr and Cs were maintained at the steel surface by sorption/selective incorporation into the Cr-rich passive film. In 12 M HNO 3 , corrosion and severe intergranular attack led to Sr diffusion into the passive layer and steel bulk. In HNO 3 , Sr and Cs accumulation was also commensurate with corrosion product (Fe and Cr) readsorption, and in the 12 M HNO 3 system, XPS documented the presence of Sr and Cs chromates.",ACS omega,CHEM

The first is a rapid oxidation of ferrocytochrome c , followed by a second, slower, irreversible disruption of heme c . The oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by CLOOH is explained by the Fenton-type reaction. Heme scission is a consequence of the radical mediated reactions initiated by the interaction of ferric heme iron with cardiolipin hydroperoxides. Simultaneously with the heme c disruption, generation of hydroxyl radical is detected by EPR spectroscopy using the spin trapping technique. The resulting apocytochrome c sediments as a heterogeneous mixture of high aggregates, as judged by sedimentation analysis.

0.998041131,31510645,Identifying progressive imaging genetic patterns via multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis: a longitudinal study of the ADNI cohort,"Abstract Motivation Identifying the genetic basis of the brain structure, function and disorder by using the imaging quantitative traits (QTs) as endophenotypes is an important task in brain science. Brain QTs often change over time while the disorder progresses and thus understanding how the genetic factors play roles on the progressive brain QT changes is of great importance and meaning. Most existing imaging genetics methods only analyze the baseline neuroimaging data, and thus those longitudinal imaging data across multiple time points containing important disease progression information are omitted. Results We propose a novel temporal imaging genetic model which performs the multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis (T-MTSCCA). Our model uses longitudinal neuroimaging data to uncover that how single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play roles on affecting brain QTs over the time. Incorporating the relationship of the longitudinal imaging data and that within SNPs, T-MTSCCA could identify a trajectory of progressive imaging genetic patterns over the time. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem and show its convergence. We evaluate T-MTSCCA on 408 subjects from the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database with longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data and genetic data available. The experimental results show that T-MTSCCA performs either better than or equally to the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, T-MTSCCA could identify higher canonical correlation coefficients and capture clearer canonical weight patterns. This suggests that T-MTSCCA identifies time-consistent and time-dependent SNPs and imaging QTs, which further help understand the genetic basis of the brain QT changes over the time during the disease progression.

0.585175411,29522403,Quantifying the Effects of Increasing Mechanical Stress on Knee Acoustical Emissions Using Unsupervised Graph Mining," In this paper, we investigate the effects of increasing mechanical stress on the knee joints by recording knee acoustical emissions and analyze them using an unsupervised graph mining algorithm. We placed miniature contact microphones on four different locations: on the lateral and medial sides of the patella and superficial to the lateral and medial meniscus. We extracted audio features in both time and frequency domains from the acoustical signals and calculated the graph community factor (GCF): an index of heterogeneity (variation) in the sounds due to different loading conditions enforced on the knee. To determine the GCF, a k-Nearest Neighbor graph was constructed and an Infomap community detection algorithm was used to extract all potential clusters within the graph ‚Äì the number of detected communities were then quantified with GCF. Measurements from twelve healthy subjects showed that the GCF increased monotonically and significantly with vertical loading forces (mean GCF for no load = 30 and mean GCF for maximum load [body weight] = 39). This suggests that the increased complexity of the emitted sounds is related to the increased forces on the joint. In addition, microphones placed on the medial side of the patella and superficial to the lateral meniscus produced the most variation in the joint sounds. This information can be used to determine the optimal location for the microphones to obtain acoustical emissions with greatest sensitivity to loading. In future work, joint loading quantification based on acoustical emissions and derived GCF can be used for assessing cumulative knee usage and loading during activities, for example for patients rehabilitating knee injuries.

0.859786359,21349341,Individual Differences in Neural Activity During A Facial Expression vs. Identity Working Memory Task," Facial expressions of emotion constitute a critical portion of our non-verbal social interactions. In addition, the identity of the individual displaying this expression is critical to these interactions as they embody the context in which these expressions will be interpreted. To identify any overlapping and/or unique brain circuitry involved in the processing of these two information streams in a laboratory setting, participants performed a working memory (WM) task (i.e., N-back) in which they were instructed to monitor either the expression (EMO) or the identity (ID) of the same set of face stimuli. Consistent with previous work, during both the EMO and ID tasks, we found a significant increase in activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) supporting its generalized role in WM. Further, individuals that showed greater DLPFC activity during both tasks also showed increased amygdala activity during the EMO task and increased lateral fusiform gyrus activity during the ID task. Importantly, the level of activity in these regions significantly correlated with performance on the respective tasks. These findings provide support for two separate neural circuitries, both involving the DLPFC, supporting working memory for these two distinct aspects of face processing/memory. ",NeuroImage,NEURO
0.191332977,29773980,Anatomical Inputs From the Sensory and Value Structures to the Tail of the Rat Striatum,"The caudal region of the rodent striatum, called the tail of the striatum (TS), is a relatively small area but might have a distinct function from other striatal subregions. Recent primate studies showed that this part of the striatum has a unique function in encoding long-term value memory of visual objects for habitual behavior. This function might be due to its specific connectivity. We identified inputs to the rat TS and compared those with inputs to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) in the same animals. The TS directly received anatomical inputs from both sensory structures and value-coding regions, but the DMS did not. First, inputs from the sensory cortex and sensory thalamus to the TS were found; visual, auditory, somatosensory and gustatory cortex and thalamus projected to the TS but not to the DMS. Second, two value systems innervated the TS; dopamine and serotonin neurons in the lateral part of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and dorsal raphe nucleus projected to the TS, respectively. The DMS received inputs from the separate group of dopamine neurons in the medial part of the SNc. In addition, learning-related regions of the limbic system innervated the TS; the temporal areas and the basolateral amygdala selectively innervated the TS, but not the DMS. Our data showed that both sensory and value-processing structures innervated the TS, suggesting its plausible role in value-guided sensory-motor association for habitual behavior.",Frontiers in neuroanatomy,NEURO
0.7905949,31312158,Explicit and Implicit Affect and Judgment in Schizotypy,"Although emotion deficits in schizotypy have been reported, the exact nature of these deficits is now well understood. Specifically, for social anhedonia (SocAnh), there are questions about whether any decrease in positive affect only reflects an explicit bias not observed in other measures (e.g., implicit affect measure). At the same time, for individuals with elevated levels of perceptual aberrations or magical ideation (PerMag), there is some evidence of an increased influence of affect on judgment. It is also possible that the influence of implicit affect on judgment might be especially pronounced in PerMag; however, this has not been previously examined. The current study involved people with elevated levels of SocAnh ( n = 95), elevated levels of PerMag ( n = 62), and people with average or lower levels of both ( n = 246). We found that SocAnh was associated with decreases in both explicit and implicit positive affect. We also found that PerMag was related to stronger relationships between implicit affect, both positive and negative, and a judgment task. These results suggest that decreased positive affect is a core feature of SocAnh and that a heightened influence of affect could be related to the development of peculiar beliefs/experiences associated with PerMag.",Frontiers in psychology,PSYCH

Treadmill exercise also facilitates the functional recovery of SCI. Previously, we reported that combination of BMSCs transplantation with treadmill exercise potentiated the locomotor function in SCI rats. In the present study, we investigated whether recovery effect of BMSCs transplantation or treadmill exercise appears through the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-extracellular signal‚Äìregulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. The spinal cord contusion injury was performed at the T9‚ÄìT10 level using the impactor. Cultured BMSCs were transplanted directly into the lesion 1 week after SCI. Treadmill exercise was performed 6 days per a week for 6 weeks. Western blot for Bax, Bcl-2, BDNF, tyrosine kinase B (TrkB), and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), phosphorylated JNK was performed. In the present results, combination of BMSCs transplantation with tread-mill exercise potently decreased Bax expression, potently increased Bcl-2 expression, and potently enhanced BDNF and TrkB expressions in the injured spinal cord. Combination of BMSCs transplantation with treadmill exercise further facilitated p-ERK1/2 and p-c-Jun expression levels.

It was observed that the maximum experimental adsorption capacity, q m , exp , in water is up to 50 mg g -1 and decreases with increase in weight percentage of ethanol and NaCl and HCl concentration compared to that of water. Analysis of data using ARIAN model showed that MB adsorbs as monomer and dimer on the surface of agar. Binding constants of MB to agar were calculated using the Temkin isotherm. The process is exothermic in water and other solutions. The mean adsorption energy ( E ) value indicated binding of MB to agar is chemical adsorption.

The Fe/Pd nanoaggregates were used to examine dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE) with regard to matrix effects using materials representative of a potential zero-valent metal remediation site surrounding the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant in Paducah, KY. A surface-area-normalized first-order rate constant of 1.4 √ó 10 ‚Äì1 L m ‚Äì2 h ‚Äì1 was obtained for the case of ideal dechlorination of 19.6 mg L ‚Äì1 TCE at room temperature and pH 6.2 using 0.5 g L ‚Äì1 Fe/Pd (0.42 wt % Pd) loading. This value decreases by an order of magnitude to 1.9 √ó 10 ‚Äì2 L m ‚Äì2 h ‚Äì1 when the reaction is carried out in a realistic background matrix when the pH is high (8.8). For all variables tested, Pd content has the most impact on reaction rates.

0.951802246,30545289,The optimality of the standard genetic code assessed by an eight-objective evolutionary algorithm,"Background The standard genetic code (SGC) is a unique set of rules which assign amino acids to codons. Similar amino acids tend to have similar codons indicating that the code evolved to minimize the costs of amino acid replacements in proteins, caused by mutations or translational errors. However, if such optimization in fact occurred, many different properties of amino acids must have been taken into account during the code evolution. Therefore, this problem can be reformulated as a multi-objective optimization task, in which the selection constraints are represented by measures based on various amino acid properties. Results To study the optimality of the SGC we applied a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and we used the representatives of eight clusters, which grouped over 500 indices describing various physicochemical properties of amino acids. Thanks to that we avoided an arbitrary choice of amino acid features as optimization criteria. As a consequence, we were able to conduct a more general study on the properties of the SGC than the ones presented so far in other papers on this topic. We considered two models of the genetic code, one preserving the characteristic codon blocks structure of the SGC and the other without this restriction. The results revealed that the SGC could be significantly improved in terms of error minimization, hereby it is not fully optimized. Its structure differs significantly from the structure of the codes optimized to minimize the costs of amino acid replacements. On the other hand, using newly defined quality measures that placed the SGC in the global space of theoretical genetic codes, we showed that the SGC is definitely closer to the codes that minimize the costs of amino acids replacements than those maximizing them. Conclusions The standard genetic code represents most likely only partially optimized systems, which emerged under the influence of many different factors. Our findings can be useful to researchers involved in modifying the genetic code of the living organisms and designing artificial ones.",BMC evolutionary biology,ECO

Today, aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs) are widely applied for this purpose. However, they are usually the largest components in electronic circuits. Replacing AECs by more compact capacitors will have an immense impact on future electronic devices. Here, we report a double-layer capacitor based on three-dimensional (3D) interpenetrating graphene electrodes fabricated by electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (ErGO-DLC). At 120-hertz, the ErGO-DLC exhibited a phase angle of ‚àí84 degrees, a specific capacitance of 283 microfaradays per centimeter square and a resistor-capacitor (RC) time constant of 1.35 milliseconds, making it capable of replacing AECs for the application of 120-hertz filtering.",Scientific reports,ENG

In recent years, in silico prediction methods received great attention in an attempt to reduce animal experiments for the evaluation of various toxicological endpoints, complementing the theme of replace, reduce and refine. Various computational approaches have been proposed for the prediction of compound toxicity ranging from quantitative structure activity relationship modeling to molecular similarity-based methods and machine learning. Within the ‚ÄúToxicology in the 21st Century‚Äù screening initiative, a crowd-sourcing platform was established for the development and validation of computational models to predict the interference of chemical compounds with nuclear receptor and stress response pathways based on a training set containing more than 10,000 compounds tested in high-throughput screening assays. Results Here, we present the results of various molecular similarity-based and machine-learning based methods over an independent evaluation set containing 647 compounds as provided by the Tox21 Data Challenge 2014. It was observed that the Random Forest approach based on MACCS molecular fingerprints and a subset of 13 molecular descriptors selected based on statistical and literature analysis performed best in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values. Further, we compared the individual and combined performance of different methods. In retrospect, we also discuss the reasons behind the superior performance of an ensemble approach, combining a similarity search method with the Random Forest algorithm, compared to individual methods while explaining the intrinsic limitations of the latter. Conclusions Our results suggest that, although prediction methods were optimized individually for each modelled target, an ensemble of similarity and machine-learning approaches provides promising performance indicating its broad applicability in toxicity prediction.

There is an increasing interest in using arrays to generate more complex beam shapes and corresponding acoustic radiation force patterns for manipulation of particles such as kidney stones. Toward this end, experimental and computational tools are needed to enable accurate delivery of desired transducer vibrations and corresponding ultrasound fields. The purpose of this study was to characterize the vibrations of a 256-element array at 1.5 MHz, implement strategies to compensate for variability, and test the ability to generate specified vortex beams that are relevant to particle manipulation. Characterization of the array output was performed in water using both element-by-element measurements at the focus of the array and holography measurements for which all elements were excited simultaneously. Both methods were used to quantify each element‚Äôs output so that the power of each element could be equalized. Vortex beams generated using both compensation strategies were measured and compared to Rayleigh integral simulations of fields generated by an idealized array based on the manufacturer‚Äôs specifications. Although both approaches improved beam axisymmetry, compensation based on holography measurements had half the error relative to the simulation results in comparison to the element-by-element method.

We also show the importance of exercise intensity in inducing these changes. Similar to muscles, the intestine is also insulin resistant in obese subjects and subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. Exercise training improves muscle insulin sensitivity, but its effects on intestinal metabolism are not known. We studied the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on intestinal glucose and free fatty acid uptake from circulation in humans. Twenty-eight healthy, middle-aged, sedentary men were randomized for 2 wk of HIIT or MICT. Intestinal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and fasting free fatty acid uptake from circulation were measured using positron emission tomography and [ 18 F]FDG and [ 18 F]FTHA. In addition, effects of HIIT and MICT on intestinal GLUT2 and CD36 protein expression were studied in rats. Training improved aerobic capacity ( P = 0.001) and whole body insulin sensitivity ( P = 0.04), but not differently between HIIT and MICT. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake increased only after the MICT in the colon (HIIT‚Äâ=‚Äâ0%; MICT‚Äâ=‚Äâ37%) ( P = 0.02 for time √ó training) and tended to increase in the jejunum (HIIT‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚àí4%; MICT‚Äâ=‚Äâ13%) ( P = 0.08 for time √ó training). Fasting free fatty acid uptake decreased in the duodenum in both groups (HIIT‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚àí6%; MICT‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚àí48%) ( P = 0.001 time) and tended to decrease in the colon in the MICT group (HIIT‚Äâ=‚Äâ0%; MICT‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚àí38%) ( P = 0.08 for time √ó training). In rats, both training groups had higher GLUT2 and CD36 expression compared with control animals. This study shows that already 2 wk of MICT enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, while both training modes reduce fasting free fatty acid uptake in the intestine in healthy, middle-aged men, providing an additional mechanism by which exercise training can improve whole body metabolism.

0.527876348,19542457,Antibodies in a heavy chain knock-in mouse exhibit characteristics of early heavy chain rearrangement," Studies in autoantibody transgenic mice have demonstrated receptor editing rearrangements at antibody heavy and light chain loci. However, the physiologic role of heavy chain editing (V H replacement and rearrangement on the second allele) has been called into question. It is unclear if additional rounds of heavy chain rearrangement are driven by BCR specificity. Here we analyze the manner in which B cells undergo additional heavy chain (H chain) rearrangements in an anti-DNA heavy chain knock-in mouse, B6.56R. We find that rearrangements in 56R+ B cells tend to involve the D gene locus on both alleles and the most J H -proximal V H gene segments on the endogenous allele. As a result, some B cells exhibit V(D)J rearrangements on both H chain alleles, yet allelic exclusion is tightly maintained in mature 56R B cells. As B cells mature, a higher proportion expresses the non-transgenic heavy chain allele. Rearrangements on both H chain alleles exhibit junctional diversity consistent with TdT-mediated N-addition, and TdT RNA is expressed exclusively at the pro-B cell stage in B6.56R. Collectively, these findings favor a single, early window of H chain rearrangement in B6.56R that precedes the expression of a functional BCR. B cells that happen to successfully rearrange another heavy chain may be favored in the periphery. ","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",IMMUN

However, whether BAP1 and PBRM1 loss causes ccRCC and determines tumor grade is unclear. We conditionally targeted Bap1 and Pbrm1 (with Vhl ) in the mouse using several Cre drivers. Sglt2 and Villin proximal convoluted tubule drivers failed to cause tumorigenesis, challenging the conventional notion of ccRCC origins. In contrast, targeting with Pax8, a developmental lineage-specific transcription factor, led to ccRCC of different grade. Bap1 -deficient tumors were high grade and showed greater mTORC1 activation than Pbrm1 -deficient tumors, which exhibited longer latency. Disrupting one allele of the mTORC1 negative regulator, Tsc1 , in Pbrm1 -deficient kidneys triggered higher grade ccRCC. This study establishes Bap1 and Pbrm1 as lineage-specific drivers of ccRCC and histological grade, implicates mTORC1 as a tumor grade rheostat, and suggests that ccRCC may arise from Bowman capsule cells.

Recent biogeographical analyses indicate that D. robusta invaded North America from southeast Asia and has persisted in eastern temperate forests for at least 20‚Äì25 my without speciating. The abundant chromosome polymorphisms found across the range of D. robusta are thus likely to be relatively ancient, having accumulated over many well known climatic cycles in North America. Sufficient long-term data are now available such that we can now gauge the rate of these evolutionary changes in natural populations due to environmental change. Results Recent local collections have revealed significant changes in the frequencies of several chromosomal forms. New data presented here extend the range of these changes to six states, three in the northeastern United States and three west of the Mississippi River. These data reinforce recent directional changes in which the frequencies of three gene arrangements have reached percentage levels typical of distant southern populations consistent with regional climatic changes. Another gene arrangement has been steadily decreasing in frequency at a number of the sites studied. Meteorological records from 1945 to 2003 indicate temperature increases at all study sites, particularly average minimum air temperatures. Conclusions Observation of parallel genetic flux suggests that these long-term temporal frequency shifts in widely disparate populations of D. robusta are evolutionary responses to environmental change. Since these chromosomes are known to be sensitive to ambient temperature, regional climatic shifts associated with global warming are likely to be responsible.",BMC evolutionary biology,ECO

Competition over limited water resources is one of the main concerns for the coming decades. Although water issues alone have not been the sole trigger for warfare in the past, tensions over freshwater management and use represent one of the main concerns in political relations between riparian states and may exacerbate existing tensions, increase regional instability and social unrest. Previous studies made great efforts to understand how international water management problems were addressed by actors in a more cooperative or confrontational way. In this study, we analyze what are the pre-conditions favoring the insurgence of water management issues in shared water bodies, rather than focusing on the way water issues are then managed among actors. We do so by proposing an innovative analysis of past episodes of conflict and cooperation over transboundary water resources (jointly defined as ‚Äúhydro-political interactions‚Äù). On the one hand, we aim at highlighting the factors that are more relevant in determining water interactions across political boundaries. On the other hand, our objective is to map and monitor the evolution of the likelihood of experiencing hydro-political interactions over space and time, under changing socioeconomic and biophysical scenarios, through a spatially explicit data driven index. Historical cross-border water interactions were used as indicators of the magnitude of corresponding water joint-management issues. These were correlated with information about river basin freshwater availability, climate stress, human pressure on water resources, socioeconomic conditions (including institutional development and power imbalances), and topographic characteristics. This analysis allows for identification of the main factors that determine water interactions, such as water availability, population density, power imbalances, and climatic stressors. The proposed model was used to map at high spatial resolution the probability of experiencing hydro-political interactions worldwide. This baseline outline is then compared to four distinct climate and population density projections aimed to estimate trends for hydro-political interactions under future conditions (2050 and 2100), while considering two greenhouse gases emission scenarios (moderate and extreme climate change). The combination of climate and population growth dynamics is expected to impact negatively on the overall hydro-political risk by increasing the likelihood of water interactions in the transboundary river basins, with an average increase ranging between 74.9% (2050 ‚Äì population and moderate climate change) to 95% (2100 - population and extreme climate change). Future demographic and climatic conditions are expected to exert particular pressure on already water stressed basins such as the Nile, the Ganges/Brahmaputra, the Indus, the Tigris/Euphrates, and the Colorado. The results of this work allow us to identify current and future areas where water issues are more likely to arise, and where cooperation over water should be actively pursued to avoid possible tensions especially under changing environmental conditions. From a policy perspective, the index presented in this study can be used to provide a sound quantitative basis to the assessment of the Sustainable Development Goal 6, Target 6.5 ‚ÄúWater resources management‚Äù, and in particular to indicator 6.5.2 ‚ÄúTransboundary cooperation‚Äù.",Global environmental change : human and policy dimensions,ENVIRON

They are tolerant to repeated desiccation/rehydration cycles and adapted to anhydrobiosis. Nitric oxide (NO) is a keystone for stress tolerance of lichens; during lichen rehydration, NO limits free radicals and lipid peroxidation but no data on the mechanisms of its synthesis exist. The aim of this work is to characterize the synthesis of NO in the lichen Ramalina farinacea using inhibitors of nitrate reductase (NR) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), tungstate, and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), respectively. Tungstate suppressed the NO level in the lichen and caused an increase in malondialdehyde during rehydration in the hyphae of cortex and in phycobionts, suggesting that a plant-like NR is involved in the NO production. Specific activity of NR in R. farinacea was 91 ŒºU/mg protein, a level comparable to those in the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens and Arabidopsis thaliana . L-NAME treatment did not suppress the NO level in the lichens. On the other hand, NADPH-diaphorase activity cytochemistry showed a possible presence of a NOS-like activity in the microalgae where it is associated with cytoplasmatic vesicles.

Despite remarkable antidiabetic effects, GLP-1 peptide-based drugs are limited by the need of injection. On the other hand, developing nonpeptidic small-molecule drugs targeting GLP-1R remains elusive. Here, we first constructed a three-dimensional structure model of the transmembrane (TM) domain of human GLP-1R using homology modeling and conformational sampling techniques. Next, a potential allosteric binding site on the TM domain was predicted computationally. In silico screening of druglike compounds against this predicted allosteric site has identified nine compounds as potential GLP-1R agonists. The independent agonistic activity of two compounds was subsequently confirmed using a cAMP response element-based luciferase reporting system. One compound was also shown to stimulate insulin secretion through in vitro assay. In addition, this compound synergized with GLP-1 to activate human GLP-1R.

By bioinformatics analysis, we identified CTD-2510F5.4 was a malignant phenotype associated lncRNA. The expression levels of CTD-2510F5.4 in tissues were detected by ISH, and the relationships between CTD-2510F5.4 expression and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed by statistical analysis. Results By bioinformatics analysis and functional analysis, we identified CTD-2510F5.4 was a malignant phenotype associated lncRNA of gastric cancer that potentially regulated cell cycle and apoptosis. CTD-2510F5.4 expression was significantly higher in gastric cancers, and was correlated with pathological grade, vascular or nerve invasion, AJCC TNM stage and OS. Moreover, gastric cancer patients with high CTD-2510F5.4 expression showed significantly shorter MST. High CTD-2510F5.4 expression was a independent risk factor for gastric cancers at pathological grade <‚ÄâIII and without vascular or nerve invasion. Conclusions We identified CTD-2510F5.4 was a malignant phenotype associated lncRNA potentially involved in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. Our data also supported the clinical potential of CTD-2510F5.4 being a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer.

0.372639054,20546591,Expression profiling of  Crambe abyssinica  under arsenate stress identifies genes and gene networks involved in arsenic metabolism and detoxification,"Background Arsenic contamination is widespread throughout the world and this toxic metalloid is known to cause cancers of organs such as liver, kidney, skin, and lung in human. In spite of a recent surge in arsenic related studies, we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of arsenic uptake, detoxification, and sequestration in plants. Crambe abyssinica , commonly known as 'abyssinian mustard', is a non-food, high biomass oil seed crop that is naturally tolerant to heavy metals. Moreover, it accumulates significantly higher levels of arsenic as compared to other species of the Brassicaceae family. Thus, C. abyssinica has great potential to be utilized as an ideal inedible crop for phytoremediation of heavy metals and metalloids. However, the mechanism of arsenic metabolism in higher plants, including C. abyssinica , remains elusive. Results To identify the differentially expressed transcripts and the pathways involved in arsenic metabolism and detoxification, C. abyssinica plants were subjected to arsenate stress and a PCR-Select Suppression Subtraction Hybridization (SSH) approach was employed. A total of 105 differentially expressed subtracted cDNAs were sequenced which were found to represent 38 genes. Those genes encode proteins functioning as antioxidants, metal transporters, reductases, enzymes involved in the protein degradation pathway, and several novel uncharacterized proteins. The transcripts corresponding to the subtracted cDNAs showed strong upregulation by arsenate stress as confirmed by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Conclusions Our study revealed novel insights into the plant defense mechanisms and the regulation of genes and gene networks in response to arsenate toxicity. The differential expression of transcripts encoding glutathione-S-transferases, antioxidants, sulfur metabolism, heat-shock proteins, metal transporters, and enzymes in the ubiquitination pathway of protein degradation as well as several unknown novel proteins serve as molecular evidence for the physiological responses to arsenate stress in plants. Additionally, many of these cDNA clones showing strong upregulation due to arsenate stress could be used as valuable markers. Further characterization of these differentially expressed genes would be useful to develop novel strategies for efficient phytoremediation as well as for engineering arsenic tolerant crops with reduced arsenic translocation to the edible parts of plants.",BMC plant biology,ANIMAL
0.559849029,27599587,Antimicrobial Chemicals Are Associated with Elevated Antibiotic Resistance Genes in the Indoor Dust Microbiome,"Antibiotic resistance is increasingly widespread, largely due to human influence. Here, we explore the relationship between antibiotic resistance genes and the antimicrobial chemicals triclosan, triclocarban, and methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben in the dust microbiome. Dust samples from a mixed-use athletic and educational facility were subjected to microbial and chemical analyses using a combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenome sequencing, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The dust resistome was characterized by identifying antibiotic resistance genes annotated in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) from the metagenomes of each sample using the Short, Better Representative Extract Data set (ShortBRED). The three most highly abundant antibiotic resistance genes were tet (W), blaSRT-1 , and erm (B). The complete dust resistome was then compared against the measured concentrations of antimicrobial chemicals, which for triclosan ranged from 0.5 to 1970 ng/g dust. We observed six significant positive associations between the concentration of an antimicrobial chemical and the relative abundance of an antibiotic resistance gene, including one between the ubiquitous antimicrobial triclosan and erm (X), a 23S rRNA methyltransferase implicated in resistance to several antibiotics.

It can cause severe losses in fresh water aquaculture and is particularly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. Fresh leaves from maize and bananas have been used as feed supplement by fish farmers in Vietnam and it has been reported that they may have phyto-prophylactic benefits. In the present study, a feeding trial was conducted to investigate the benefits of providing maize and banana leaves as feed supplement: to determine if they were taken up and digested by grass carp ( Ctenopharyngodon idella ), if this uptake resulted in improved growth performance, and if leaf supplementation protected fish when challenged with A. hydrophila by intramuscular injection. Results All fish were fed an identical ratio of commercial pelleted feed relative to biomass. However, in 12/18 tanks, this diet was supplemented with either fresh banana leaves or fresh maize leaves; offered ad libitum. Addition of leaves increased the overall feed conversion ratio (FCR) significantly. However, if only the pellet were taken into account, then no difference was found between treatments. Changes to the isotopic composition of the fish showed leaf nutrient uptake occurred. No prophylactic effects of feeding banana or maize leaves were detected against infection with A. hydrophila , and the diet did not induce changes in the fish haematocrit. However, addition of the maize leaves was associated with significantly reduced severity of the skin lesions, which could improve the market value of the fish. Conclusions Addition of the leaf supplement did not result in significantly improved growth performance. Similarly, the effect of the supplement on the fish survival to infection was not significant.

0.712314431,29397682,Label-Free Quantification of Small Molecule Binding to Membrane Proteins on Single Cells by Tracking Nanometer-Scale Cellular Membrane Deformation," Measuring molecular binding to membrane proteins is critical for understanding cellular functions, validating biomarkers and screening drugs. Despite the importance, developing such a capability has been a difficult challenge, especially for small molecule binding to membrane proteins in their native cellular environment. Here we show that the binding of both large and small molecules to membrane proteins can be quantified on single cells by trapping single cells with a microfluidic device, and detecting binding-induced cellular membrane deformation on nanometer-scale with label-free optical imaging. We develop a thermodynamic model to describe the binding-induced membrane deformation, validate the model by examining the dependence of membrane deformation on cell stiffness, membrane protein expression level and binding affinity, and study four major types of membrane proteins, including glycoproteins, ion channels, G-protein coupled and tyrosine kinase receptors. The single cell detection capability reveals the importance of local membrane environment on molecular binding, and variability in the binding kinetics of different cell lines, and heterogeneity of different cells within the same cell line.

Little is known about urban‚Äìrural differences in children's height and weight, and how these differences have changed over time. We aimed to investigate trends in children's height and weight in rural and urban settings in low-income and middle-income countries, and to assess changes in the urban‚Äìrural differentials in height and weight over time. Methods We used comprehensive population-based data and a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model to estimate trends in children's height-for-age and weight-for-age Z scores by rural and urban place of residence, and changes in urban‚Äìrural differentials in height and weight Z scores, for 141 low-income and middle-income countries between 1985 and 2011. We also estimated the contribution of changes in rural and urban height and weight, and that of urbanisation, to the regional trends in these outcomes. Findings Urban children are taller and heavier than their rural counterparts in almost all low-income and middle-income countries. The urban‚Äìrural differential is largest in Andean and central Latin America (eg, Peru, Honduras, Bolivia, and Guatemala); in some African countries such as Niger, Burundi, and Burkina Faso; and in Vietnam and China. It is smallest in southern and tropical Latin America (eg, Chile and Brazil). Urban children in China, Chile, and Jamaica are the tallest in low-income and middle-income countries, and children in rural areas of Burundi, Guatemala, and Niger the shortest, with the tallest and shortest more than 10 cm apart at age 5 years. The heaviest children live in cities in Georgia, Chile, and China, and the most underweight in rural areas of Timor-Leste, India, Niger, and Bangladesh. Between 1985 and 2011, the urban advantage in height fell in southern and tropical Latin America and south Asia, but changed little or not at all in most other regions. The urban‚Äìrural weight differential also decreased in southern and tropical Latin America, but increased in east and southeast Asia and worldwide, because weight gain of urban children outpaced that of rural children. Interpretation Further improvement of child nutrition will require improved access to a stable and affordable food supply and health care for both rural and urban children, and closing of the the urban‚Äìrural gap in nutritional status.

0.200941571,21156360,Numerical Study of a Simple Transcranial Focused Ultrasound System Applied to Blood-Brain Barrier Opening," In this paper, we investigate the focalization properties of single-element transducers at low frequencies (300 to 1000 kHz) through primate and human skulls. The study addresses the transcranial targeting involved in ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening with clinically relevant targets such as the hippocampus and the basal ganglia, which are typically affected by early Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs disease, respectively. A finite-difference, time-domain simulation platform is used to solve the 3-D linear acoustic wave equation with CT-based acoustic maps of the skulls. The targeted brain structures were extracted from 3-D brain atlases registered with the skulls and used to virtually position and orient the transducers. The effect of frequency is first investigated and the targeting of the different structures is then tested. The frequency of 500 kHz provided the best trade off between phase aberrations and standing wave effects in the human case, whereas the frequency of 800 kHz was most suitable in the case of the primate skull. A fast periodic linear chirp method was developed and found capable of reducing the standing wave effects. Such a simple, affordable, and convenient system is concluded to be feasible for BBB opening in primates and humans and could thus allow for its broader impact and applications.

Patient archives from the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery of Weihai Municipal Hospital (Weihai, China) were retrospectively collected between January 2011 and January 2012. Of the 221 consecutive patients identified, 192 patients who met the criterion were deemed eligible for inclusion. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted to detect the expression of MMR proteins MutL homolog 1 (MLH1), MutS homolog 2 (MSH2), MSH6 and PMS1 homolog 2, mismatch repair system component (PMS2) expression and mutation in sporadic colorectal cancer (SCRC). Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were performed to conduct survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression models were conducted to determine independent prognostic factors. The total rate of deficient MMR (dMMR) was 14.58% (28/192): MSH6, 0.52% (1/192); PMS2, 4.17% (8/192); MSH2/MSH6, 3.65% (7/192); and MLH1/PMS2, 6.25% (12/192). The dMMR group had a significantly longer overall survival time compared with proficient MMR (pMMR) group (P=0.017). Disease-free survival time of dMMR group was also longer than pMMR group (P=0.027). Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model confirmed that MMR status was an independent prognostic factor for SCRC. Loss of MMR expression was indicative of a favorable outcome for patients with SCRC, and MMR status could be viewed as an independent prognostic factor.",Oncology letters,ONCO

In this study, we investigate several structural parameters of the corticospinal tract and their relation to the TMS motor threshold (MT) in 17 subjects, with and without schizophrenia.

We also measured the skull-to-cortex distance over the left motor region. The anterior‚Äìposterior trajectory of principle diffusion direction of the corticospinal tract and skull-to-cortex distance were both found to be highly correlated with MT, while fractional anisotropy, age and schizophrenia status were not. Two parameters‚Äîskull-to-cortex distance and the anterior component of the principle diffusion direction of the corticospinal tract as it passes the internal capsule‚Äîare highly predictive of MT in a linear regression model, and account for 82% of the variance observed ( R 2 = 0.82, F = 20.27, P < 0.0001) in measurements of MT.

The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of performing a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of hypothermia in patients with ARDS receiving treatment with neuromuscular blockade (NMB) because they cannot shiver.    Design  Retrospective study and pilot prospective open-label feasibility study.    Setting  Medical Intensive Care Unit.    Patients  Retrospective review of 58 patients with ARDS based on Berlin criteria and P a O2:FiO2 (P:F)<150 who received NMB. Prospective hypothermia treatment in 8 ARDS patients with (P:F)<150 receiving NMB.    Intervention  Cooling to 34¬∞‚Äì36¬∞C for 48h.    Measurements and Main Results  Core temperature, hemodynamics, serum glucose and electrolytes, and P:F, were sequentially measured and medians (interquartile ranges) presented, and 28-day ventilator-free days (VFDs), and hospital mortaltiy were calculated in historical controls and 8 cooled patients. Average patient core temperature was 36.7(36‚Äì37.3)¬∞C and fever occurred during NMB in 30/58 retrospective patients. In the prospectively cooled patients core temperature reached target range ‚â§4h of initiating cooling, remained <36¬∞C for 92% of the 48h cooling period without adverse events, and was lower than the controls (34.35(34‚Äì34.8)¬∞C; p<0.0001). Compared with historical controls, the cooled patients tended to have lower hospital mortality (75% vs 53.4%; p=0.26), more VFDs (9(0‚Äì21.5) vs. 0(0‚Äì12); p=0.16) and higher day-3 P:F (255(160‚Äì270) vs. 171(120‚Äì214), p=0.024).

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is widely used as a single-molecule assay to monitor intramolecular dynamics in the distance range of 3‚Äì8 nm. Here we demonstrate that self-quenching of two rhodamine derivatives can be used to detect small conformational dynamics corresponding to sub-nanometer distance changes in a FRET-insensitive short range at the single molecule level. A ParM protein mutant labeled with two rhodamines works as a single molecule ADP sensor which has 20 times brighter fluorescence signal in the ADP bound state than the unbound state. Single molecule time trajectories show discrete transitions between fluorescence on and off states that can be directly ascribed to ADP binding and dissociation events. The conformational changes observed with 20:1 contrast are only 0.5 nm in magnitude and are between crystallographic distances of 1.6 nm and 2.1 nm, demonstrating exquisite sensitivity to short distance scale changes. The systems also allowed us to gain information on the photophysics of self-quenching induced by rhodamine stacking: (1) photobleaching of either of the two rhodamines eliminates quenching of the other rhodamine fluorophore and (2) photobleaching from the highly quenched, stacked state is only two-fold slower than from the unstacked state.

Limited knowledge exists about the effects of chronic low dose rate (LDR) exposure, particularly with respect to the application of the dose and dose rate effectiveness factor. As part of a study to investigate the development of colon cancer following chronic LDR vs. acute HDR radiation, this study presents the results of genotoxic effects in blood of exposed mice.

Its differing concentrations appear to regulate mutually antagonistic programs of B and plasma cell gene expression. We show IRF4 to be also required for generation of germinal center (GC) B cells. Its transient expression in vivo induced the expression of key GC genes including Bcl6 and Aicda . In contrast, sustained and higher concentrations of IRF4 promoted the generation of plasma cells while antagonizing the GC fate. IRF4 co-bound with the transcription factors PU.1 or BATF to Ets or AP-1 composite motifs, associated with genes involved in B cell activation and the GC response. At higher concentrations IRF4 binding shifted to interferon sequence response motifs; these enriched for genes involved in plasma cell differentiation. Our results support a model of ‚Äúkinetic control‚Äù in which signaling induced dynamics of IRF4 in activated B cells control their cell fate outcomes. ",Immunity,IMMUN

A Case for Practice Quality Over Quantity," As mindfulness-based interventions become increasingly widespread, interest has grown in better understanding which features of these treatments produce beneficial effects. The present study examined the relative contribution of mindfulness practice time and practice quality in predicting psychological functioning (negative affect, emotion regulation, quality of life, mindfulness). Data were drawn from a randomized clinical trial of mindfulness training for smokers and assessed outcomes at posttreatment ( n = 43) and 5-month follow-up ( n = 38). The intervention included instruction in mindfulness techniques targeted to smoking cessation and relapse prevention and was composed of 10 group meetings over 8 weeks. Data from 8 treatment groups were used. Mindfulness practice quality was measured weekly over the course of treatment, and multilevel modeling was used to estimate trajectories of change in practice quality. The measure of practice quality was shown to be valid and reliable, with change in practice quality predicting change in psychological functioning at both posttreatment (Œ≤= .31, 95% CI =[0.04, 0.56], p = .022) and follow-up (Œ≤= .45 [0.16, 0.73], p = .002), even when controlling for practice time. Practice time predicted outcomes at posttreatment (Œ≤= .31 [0.05, 0.57], p = .019) but not at follow-up (Œ≤= .16 [[H11002]0.14, 0.47], p = .293). Neither practice time nor change in practice quality predicted smoking abstinence at 1 month or 6 months postquit.

0.781945288,31015970,Island biogeography theory explains the genetic diversity of a fragmented rock ptarmigan ( Lagopus muta ) population,"Abstract The island biogeography theory is one of the major theories in ecology, and its applicability to natural systems is well documented. The core model of the theory, the equilibrium model of island biogeography, predicts that species diversity on an island is positively related to the size of the island, but negatively related by the island's distance to the mainland. In recent years, ecologists have begun to apply this model when investigating genetic diversity, arguing that genetic and species diversity might be influenced by similar ecological processes. However, most studies have focused on oceanic islands, but knowledge on how the theory applies to islands located on the mainland (e.g., mountain islands, forest islands) is scarce. In this study, we examined how the size and degree of isolation of mountain islands would affect the genetic diversity of an alpine bird, the rock ptarmigan ( Lagopus muta ). Within our study area, we defined the largest contiguous mountain area as the mainland, while smaller mountains surrounding the mainland were defined as islands. We found that the observed heterozygosity ( H  o ) was significantly higher, and the inbreeding coefficient ( F  is ) significantly lower, on the mainland compared to islands. There was a positive significant relationship between the unbiased expected heterozygosity ( H  n.b. ) and island size (log km 2 ), but a negative significant relationship between H  o and the cost distance to the mainland. Our results are consistent with the equilibrium model of island biogeography and show that the model is well suited for investigating genetic diversity among islands, but also on islands located on the mainland.",Ecology and evolution,ECO

Ideal biomaterials for regeneration and repair of hard tissues must be biocompatible, possess micro and macroporosity for vascular invasion, provide surface chemistry and texture that facilitate cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation of lineage specific progenitor cells, and induce deposition of calcium phosphate mineral. To expect in-vivo like cellular response several investigators have used extracellular matrix proteins as templates to recreate in-vivo microenvironment for regeneration of hard tissues. Recently, several novel methods of designing tissue repair and restoration materials using bioinspired strategies are currently being formulated. Nanoscale structured materials can be fabricated via the spontaneous organization of self-assembling proteins to construct hierarchically organized nanomaterials. The advantage of such a method is that polypeptides can be specifically designed as building blocks incorporated with molecular recognition features and spatially distributed bioactive ligands that would provide a physiological environment for cells in-vitro and in-vivo . This is a rapidly evolving area and provides a promising platform for future development of nanostructured templates for hard tissue engineering. In this review we try to highlight the importance of proteins as templates for regeneration and repair of hard tissues as well as the potential of peptide based nanomaterials for regenerative therapies.

Analogous to ‚Äúatom economy‚Äù or ‚Äústep economy‚Äù, ‚Äúredox economy‚Äù minimizes the superfluous redox manipulations within a synthesis; rather, the oxidation state of intermediates linearly and steadily increases throughout the course of the synthesis.

0.62041917,20008478,Estimating DNA coverage and abundance in metagenomes using a gamma approximation,"Motivation: Shotgun sequencing generates large numbers of short DNA reads from either an isolated organism or, in the case of metagenomics projects, from the aggregate genome of a microbial community. These reads are then assembled based on overlapping sequences into larger, contiguous sequences (contigs). The feasibility of assembly and the coverage achieved (reads per nucleotide or distinct sequence of nucleotides) depend on several factors: the number of reads sequenced, the read length and the relative abundances of their source genomes in the microbial community. A low coverage suggests that most of the genomic DNA in the sample has not been sequenced, but it is often difficult to estimate either the extent of the uncaptured diversity or the amount of additional sequencing that would be most efficacious. In this work, we regard a metagenome as a population of DNA fragments (bins), each of which may be covered by one or more reads. We employ a gamma distribution to model this bin population due to its flexibility and ease of use. When a gamma approximation can be found that adequately fits the data, we may estimate the number of bins that were not sequenced and that could potentially be revealed by additional sequencing. We evaluated the performance of this model using simulated metagenomes and demonstrate its applicability on three recent metagenomic datasets.

0.097406307,16809526,Studying Adolescence," Young people in their teens constitute the largest age group in the world, in a special stage recognized across the globe as the link in the life cycle between childhood and adulthood. Longitudinal studies in both developed and developing countries and better measurements of adolescent behavior are producing new insights. The physical and psychosocial changes that occur during puberty make manifest generational and early-childhood risks to development, in the form of individual differences in aspects such as growth, educational attainment, self-esteem, peer influences, and closeness to family. They also anticipate threats to adult health and well-being. Multidisciplinary approaches, especially links between the biological and the social sciences, as well as studies of socioeconomic and cultural diversity and determinants of positive outcomes, are needed to advance knowledge about this stage of development.

0.916874549,29559533,PDGFRŒ± +  pericryptal stromal cells are the critical source of Wnts and RSPO3 for murine intestinal stem cells in vivo,"Significance Tissue stem cells in vivo reside in highly structured niches that provide signals for proliferation and differentiation. Understanding the role of the niche requires identifying the key cell types that provide these regulators. In the intestine, R-spondins and Wnts are essential regulators of the stem-cell niche. Here we identify subepithelial myofibroblasts of the PDGF receptor Œ± lineage as the specific stromal cell type that secretes these ligands. These data demonstrate the close interaction between epithelial stem cells and the underlying regulatory stroma niche and provide insights into both normal homeostasis and tissue recovery after injury. Wnts and R-spondins (RSPOs) support intestinal homeostasis by regulating crypt cell proliferation and differentiation. Ex vivo, Wnts secreted by Paneth cells in organoids can regulate the proliferation and differentiation of Lgr5 -expressing intestinal stem cells. However, in vivo, Paneth cell and indeed all epithelial Wnt production is completely dispensable, and the cellular source of Wnts and RSPOs that maintain the intestinal stem-cell niche is not known. Here we investigated both the source and the functional role of stromal Wnts and RSPO3 in regulation of intestinal homeostasis. RSPO3 is highly expressed in pericryptal myofibroblasts in the lamina propria and is several orders of magnitude more potent than RSPO1 in stimulating both Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling and organoid growth. Stromal Rspo3 ablation ex vivo resulted in markedly decreased organoid growth that was rescued by exogenous RSPO3 protein. Pdgf receptor alpha ( PdgfRŒ± ) is known to be expressed in pericryptal myofibroblasts. We therefore evaluated if PdgfRŒ± identified the key stromal niche cells. In vivo, Porcn excision in PdgfRŒ± + cells blocked intestinal crypt formation, demonstrating that Wnt production in the stroma is both necessary and sufficient to support the intestinal stem-cell niche. Mice with Rspo3 excision in the PdgfRŒ± + cells had decreased intestinal crypt Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling and Paneth cell differentiation and were hypersensitive when stressed with dextran sodium sulfate. The data support a model of the intestinal stem-cell niche regulated by both Wnts and RSPO3 supplied predominantly by stromal pericryptal myofibroblasts marked by PdgfRŒ± .",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,BIOCHEM
0.328198734,26630287,Size Reduction in Early European Domestic Cattle Relates to Intensification of Neolithic Herding Strategies,"Our analysis of over 28,000 osteometric measurements from fossil remains dating between c. 5600 and 1500 BCE reveals a substantial reduction in body mass of 33% in Neolithic central European domestic cattle. We investigate various plausible explanations for this phenotypic adaptation, dismissing climatic change as a causal factor, and further rejecting the hypothesis that it was caused by an increase in the proportion of smaller adult females in the population. Instead we find some support for the hypothesis that the size decrease was driven by a demographic shift towards smaller newborns from sub-adult breeding as a result of intensifying meat production strategies during the Neolithic.",PloS one,ANIMAL
0.776912578,25394718,Genetic and phenotypic characterization of a hybrid zone between polyandrous Northern and Wattled Jacanas in Western Panama,"Background Hybridization provides a unique perspective into the ecological, genetic and behavioral context of speciation. Hybridization is common in birds, but has not yet been reported among bird species with a simultaneously polyandrous mating system; a mating system where a single female defends a harem of males who provide nearly all parental care. Unlike simple polyandry, polyandrous mating is extremely rare in birds, with only 1% of bird species employing this mating system. Although it is classically held that females are ‚Äúchoosy‚Äù in avian hybrid systems, nearly-exclusive male parental care raises the possibility that female selection against heterospecific matings might be reduced compared to birds with other mating systems. Results We describe a narrow hybrid zone in southwestern Panama between two polyandrous freshwater waders: Northern Jacana, Jacana spinosa and Wattled Jacana, J. jacana . We document coincident cline centers for three phenotypic traits, mtDNA, and one of two autosomal introns. Cline widths for these six markers varied from seven to 142¬†km, with mtDNA being the narrowest, and five of the six markers having widths less than 100¬†km. Cline tails were asymmetrical, with greater introgression of J. jacana traits extending westward into the range of J. spinosa . Likewise, within the hybrid zone, the average hybrid index of phenotypic hybrids was significantly biased towards J. spinosa . Species distribution models indicate that the hybrid zone is located at the edge of a roughly 100¬†km wide overlap where habitat is predicted to be suitable for both species, with more westerly areas suitable only for spinosa and eastward habitats suitable only for J. jacana . Conclusion The two species of New World jacanas maintain a narrow, and persistent hybrid zone in western Panama. The hybrid zone may be maintained by the behavioral dominance of J. spinosa counterbalanced by unsuitable habitat for J. spinosa east of the contact zone. Although the two parental species are relatively young, mitochondrial cline width was extremely narrow. This result suggests strong selection against maternally-inherited markers, which may indicate either mitonuclear incompatibilities and/or female choice against heterospecific matings typical of avian hybrid systems, despite jacana sex role reversal.

0.821611027,28616161,Geographical and climatic gradients of evergreen versus deciduous broad‚Äêleaved tree species in subtropical China: Implications for the definition of the mixed forest,"Abstract Understanding climatic influences on the proportion of evergreen versus deciduous broad‚Äêleaved tree species in forests is of crucial importance when predicting the impact of climate change on broad‚Äêleaved forests. Here, we quantified the geographical distribution of evergreen versus deciduous broad‚Äêleaved tree species in subtropical China. The Relative Importance Value index ( RIV ) was used to examine regional patterns in tree species dominance and was related to three key climatic variables: mean annual temperature ( MAT ), minimum temperature of the coldest month (MinT), and mean annual precipitation ( MAP ). We found the RIV of evergreen species to decrease with latitude at a lapse rate of 10% per degree between 23.5 and 25¬∞N, 1% per degree at 25‚Äì29.1¬∞N, and 15% per degree at 29.1‚Äì34¬∞N. The RIV of evergreen species increased with: MinT at a lapse rate of 10% per ¬∞C between ‚àí4.5 and 2.5¬∞C and 2% per ¬∞C at 2.5‚Äì10.5¬∞C; MAP at a lapse rate of 10% per 100¬†mm between 900 and 1,600¬†mm and 4% per 100¬†mm between 1,600 and 2,250¬†mm. All selected climatic variables cumulatively explained 71% of the geographical variation in dominance of evergreen and deciduous broad‚Äêleaved tree species and the climatic variables, ranked in order of decreasing effects were as follows: MinT¬†> MAP > MAT . We further proposed that the latitudinal limit of evergreen and deciduous broad‚Äêleaved mixed forests was 29.1‚Äì32¬∞N, corresponding with MAT of 11‚Äì18.1¬∞C, MinT of ‚àí2.5 to 2.51¬∞C, and MAP of 1,000‚Äì1,630¬†mm. This study is the first quantitative assessment of climatic correlates with the evergreenness and deciduousness of broad‚Äêleaved forests in subtropical China and underscores that extreme cold temperature is the most important climatic determinant of evergreen and deciduous broad‚Äêleaved tree species‚Äô distributions, a finding that confirms earlier qualitative studies. Our findings also offer new insight into the definition and distribution of the mixed forest and an accurate assessment of vulnerability of mixed forests to future climate change.",Ecology and evolution,ECO
